a more powerful iMac and a remarkable
all-new Mac mini. And we've brought
the amazing capabilities of Apple Intelligence
to the Mac. Today is all about
an incredibly powerful tool that millions of people use
to do their life's best work, MacBook Pro. With the industry-leading
efficiency of Apple silicon, MacBook Pro empowers users
to work and be creative wherever they are,
with phenomenal performance and extraordinary battery life. Now, it's time
to take it even further. >> ♪ ""Hello"" by UPSAHL ♪ ♪ You had me at hello ♪ ♪ That's all I need to know ♪ ♪ We're so compatible ♪ ♪ It's international

[WIND RUSTLING] Here's Trevor
to tell you more! ♪ ""WICKED GYAL"" by BAMBII ♪ ♪ - Let's begin with
the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which gets the blazing
performance of M4 and brand-new capabilities. It now comes in Silver and the incredibly popular
Space Black. It's great for entrepreneurs,
students, creators, or for anyone
doing what they love. M4 starts with an incredibly
powerful 10-core CPU with four performance cores
and six efficiency cores. And it has a 10-core GPU that features our most advanced
graphics architecture. With M4, MacBook Pro is up
to 1.8x faster than the 13-inch Pro with M1 for tasks like editing
gigapixel photos. And even more
demanding workloads like rendering complex scenes
in Blender are up to 3.4x faster. And with a Neural Engine that's over 3x
more powerful than in M1, it's great for features
in Apple Intelligence like Writing Tools
and other AI workloads. With M4, you can now spread out over two high-resolution
external displays in addition
to the built-in display. And MacBook Pro with M4
has three Thunderbolt 4 ports, one more than before,
so you can connect it all. Next, we're super excited
to give both the 14-
and 16-inch MacBook Pro a tremendous performance boost
with M4 Pro. It's the ideal choice
for researchers, developers, engineers, creative pros, or for anyone looking
for much faster performance. M4 Pro features a powerful CPU with 10 performance cores
and four efficiency cores for a huge jump
in multicore performance. And its 20-core GPU
is twice as powerful as M4. And M4 Pro gets
a massive 75 percent increase in memory bandwidth
over the prior generation. And it's double
that of any AI PC chip. So the new MacBook Pro is up
to 3x faster than models with M1 Pro, speeding up a variety
of workflows like geomapping, structural engineering,
and data modeling. And intelligent features
in Xcode, like predictive code completion
and Swift Assist, can dramatically speed up
software development. Plus, Apple Intelligence
will boost your productivity across the system. Here's Allegra
to tell you more. ♪ - MacBook Pro is the laptop
that helps you push the limits of what you can do. And with Apple Intelligence,
the personal intelligence system integrated
into your MacBook Pro, you can push things
even further. Apple Intelligence
transforms MacBook Pro by enabling it to understand
and create language, as well as images,
and take action for you. And it does all of this
while understanding the rich personal context
on your Mac. It draws on the immense power
of Apple silicon to run multiple
generative models right on MacBook Pro. And for even more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute
gives your MacBook Pro access to our larger
server-based models, and gives you peace of mind
that no one else can access your data,
not even Apple. And in a first for the industry, independent experts can
continually verify this promise. This is a groundbreaking
approach to privacy, one that's been described
as radically different from any other
AI system available. No matter where you do
your life's best work, Apple Intelligence
on MacBook Pro will change the game
for how you communicate, express yourself,
and get things done. In Notes,
you can use live transcription to record a meeting
and then quickly get a summary. This is incredibly handy
for so many people, like a student who can use it
to capture a study session for a classmate
who couldn't make it. And Writing Tools can help you
rewrite, proofread, or summarize whatever it is
you're working on, from everyday emails
to your most important projects. They're available virtually
everywhere you type. That includes third-party apps
that pros rely on every day. For example,
if you're a researcher who writes papers in Scrivener, you can access Writing Tools
right within the app. Use Summarization
to draft an abstract in a matter of seconds. You'll also be able
to take an original image that you created
in Image Playground and add it
right into your paper. It's incredible
how much these tools can accelerate your workflow. And there's more. Apple Intelligence now powers
a redesigned Siri experience that makes it easier than ever
to get answers fast. And we're working to bring
new capabilities to Siri that take things
to another level. Once Siri can understand
your personal context on your MacBook Pro,
it will be able to provide responses tailored
specifically to you. So when you're deep in work
and need to reference a piece of info your teammate
shared a while back, you won't have to switch gears
and go digging; Siri will quickly
get you the answer. And in addition to using
the personal context on your Mac to answer your questions, Siri will also be able
to tap into ChatGPT's expertise when it might be helpful. For example, need some insight
into sustainable fabrics? Siri will get you that info
right there. So that's a look
at a handful of the ways that Apple Intelligence
can help you get more done on MacBook Pro. And this is just the beginning. Apple Intelligence is available
now with macOS Sequoia as a free software update
in US English for most regions
around the world. We'll add localized English
for these countries in December, and we'll bring
Apple Intelligence to many more languages
next year. Now, we've got another way
for you to push the limits even further on MacBook Pro. Here's Tim Millet
to tell you more. ♪ Ethereal instrumental

in the M4 family to introduce, and that's M4 Max. M4 Max is a monster of a chip that pushes the boundaries
of power-efficient performance. It features a powerful
16-core CPU complex, and just like M4 Pro, it has the world's
fastest CPU core. M4 Max has a 40-core GPU that's twice the performance
of the one in M4 Pro, and it has more than
half a terabyte per second of unified memory bandwidth. That's 4x the bandwidth
of the latest AI PC chip. So M4 Max is amazing at
running large language models. The multithreaded
CPU performance of M4 Max is up to 2.2x faster
than M1 Max, and 2.5x faster
than the latest AI PC chip. And its GPU is up to 1.9x
faster than M1 Max, and an astounding 4x faster
than the PC chip. So heavy workloads
like denoising raw video footage in DaVinci Resolve Studio
can now run in real time. The Media Engine in M4 Max features two
ProRes accelerators. So if you're editing
4K 120 video from the new iPhone
in Final Cut Pro, performance is outrageous. Finally, M4 Max makes
running on-device AI models faster than ever with
the incredible Neural Engine that delivers
over 3x faster performance than the one in M1 Max. So that's M4 Max. With its incredible performance
and capabilities, M4 Max extends its lead
as the most powerful chip for a pro laptop, and it joins the rest
of the M4 family to form the most advanced
lineup of chips ever built
for a personal computer. Now, back to Trevor. ♪ - With M4 Max in MacBook Pro, users can work on projects
that were previously only possible on a desktop. It delivers up to 3.5x times
the performance of M1 Max, and rips through
the heaviest creative workloads, like visual effects,
3D animation, and film scoring. And with up to 128 gigabytes
of unified memory, developers can easily
interact with LLMs that have nearly
200 billion parameters. No other laptop comes close. The new MacBook Pro is an
awesome laptop for gaming too, and exciting new titles
are being added all the time, including
""Assassin's Creed Shadows,"" which is launching in February. On the new MacBook Pro, it has incredibly realistic
cinematic visuals and breathtaking scenery. And ""Cyberpunk 2077""
is coming early next year. It's one of the most
graphically demanding and complex games ever created, with advanced features
like path tracing, frame generation,
and built-in Spatial Audio for immersive gameplay
and even more stunning visuals. MacBook Pro with M4 Pro
or M4 Max also features Thunderbolt 5, which more than doubles
transfer speeds, up to 120 gigabits per second. So by connecting
just a single cable, pros like music producers
can now light up their entire studio. The industry-leading performance
per watt of the M4 family means users get up
to 24 hours of battery life, raising the bar of what
they can do on a single charge. And MacBook Pro
continues to deliver the same great performance, whether plugged in
or on battery. Next, the gorgeous XDR display
gets even better. In bright lighting conditions, it can now show your SDR content
at up to 1000 nits. And of course,
it still displays HDR content at up to 1600 nits
of peak brightness. We're also introducing an all-new nano-texture
display option, which significantly
reduces reflections. So it's game-changing
when working outside. MacBook Pro also gets a new 12-megapixel
Center Stage camera, which keeps you centered
in the frame. And it supports Desk View, which adds a whole new dimension
to your video calls. With the new Pro, you'll get
monumental improvements over Intel-based
MacBook Pro models, like the amazing features
of Apple Intelligence, nearly 10x performance
for AI-based pro workloads, up to a staggering
20x performance in graphics-intensive workloads, and up to 24 hours
of battery life. That's up to 14 more hours
than what you get on an Intel-based MacBook Pro. And you get all
these great features, from the XDR display to the amazing
six-speaker sound system. So now is a great time
to upgrade. Finally, MacBook Pro
has 100 percent fiber-based packaging, making further progress
towards our environmental goals. So that's the new MacBook Pro. With Apple Intelligence, the blazing performance
of the M4 family, a nano-texture display option,
and Thunderbolt 5, it gets even more powerful
and even more pro. Now back to John. - It's amazing what users can do
with the new MacBook Pro and Apple Intelligence. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4
now comes standard with 16GB of memory, which is double
what it was before. And it will still start
at $1599. The 16-inch MacBook Pro now
comes with 24GB of memory, and it will continue
to start at $2499. You can pre-order it today and
it'll be available next week. So that's the incredibly capable
new MacBook Pro. We also have some news
on MacBook Air. MacBook Air continues
to be by far the world's most popular laptop. And with Apple Intelligence, the best consumer laptop
on the planet gets even better. Now on models with M2 and M3, we're doubling
the starting memory to 16GB, and keeping the starting price
at just $999. It's a terrific value for
the world's best-selling laptop. This was a big week
of announcements for the Mac. The game-changing features
of Apple Intelligence transform the Mac experience. So now you can communicate,
express yourself, and quickly get things done
like never before. Apple silicon continues
to lead the industry with the tremendous performance
and capabilities of the M4 family of chips. The new iMac is even
more powerful with M4 in its gorgeous array
of new colors. It's without question
the world's best all-in-one. The new Mac mini is
more versatile than ever with the incredible performance
of M4 and M4 Pro in its unbelievably
compact design. And finally, the new MacBook Pro
with great new features and the amazing performance
of the M4 family continues to be by far
the world's best pro laptop. With this series of exciting
new product announcements this week, the Mac continues
to lead the way. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day. ♪ ""Hey!"" by Gaspard Augé ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ And here again

so this machine can hold your pen and write for you with perfect accuracy yeah five a paint sprayer but one that apparently gives a perfect coat of paint every single time I'm getting tingles just thinking about using this what are you this is very elaborate the description says it flows upwards Against Gravity this I have to see I remember fidget Spinners were a huge thing a few years ago I wonder what a 2022 fidget spinner looks like Wow multi-dimensional Let's get one of those we have animated Spinners now this one's got so many moving Parts I just want it in my hands right now why is this one like 50 okay it's luminous it's got listed here as one of the perks fidgeting can burn more calories throughout the day because you're moving more bit of a stretch if you ask me but my curiosity is peaked someone's made kind of like a fidget spinner within a fidget spinner that is a true 21st century product um who made this and why I've had an idea satisfying magnetic gadgets it's always cool to see just how many products are out there a levitating plant okay I mean the levitation is cool it's more the fact that of all things that you could be levitating you picked a plant there's also just a levitating platform that we can put anything on killing me right now this company has built a clock that uses a levitating orb as its hand s 800 for a clock okay screw it let's try some satisfying kitchen gadgets I mean this would be fantastic for my health transformation yes yes that's what I need an apple corer that can get you perfect shaped slices every single time a corn scraper okay we need to get some more of these fruit peely thingies banana slicer my body is ready yeah boy okay this isn't cheap but I'm almost just visualizing this idea of spinning this wheel and getting perfectly cut vegetable slices coming out the other side I think we have to get it all right I think we've got our kitchen gadgets covered let's try God bedroom whoa hmm I did not think that one through so if you ever design a product of your own then this machine the form box it has the capacity to be able to duplicate it I can literally remember featuring this product in a video back when the only thing that existed was just a trailer of it but now it is real and we can buy it and test it automatic zen garden Sandbar automatic is just how I like my zen it kind of looks like one of those things you could literally watch for hours waiting for it to finish the pattern it's on that's just giving me an idea I genuinely think the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced in my entire life is the DVD logo hitting the corner of the screen can we buy that DVD logo hits Corner Shopping you can buy a t-shirt with it on it's quite the same okay I'll figure out how to recreate that satisfaction by the time we get to the unboxing section of this video mark my words there's a 3D printer that can print chocolate in whatever shape you want yeah this has been my whole life on a similar note I've actually been drinking a lot more shakes recently with the whole trying to be healthy thing well instead of needing to shake your drink this thing uses a Vortex inside of it to mix it I think it'll be rude not to buy that hand towels that are actually tiny little tablets until they make contact with water yeah I didn't quite know how I got here right I have never been so excited for the products to just be here right now it's been two months and I am ready to be satisfied I think I bought a bit too much Tech so let's go from the cheapest satisfying gadgets to the most expensive to find out how much it actually costs to get that thrill starting with our kitchen gadgets so this is our corn thresher Apple divider and our banana slicer okay fruit me it's corn beautiful little corn we've got here you know it would be quite funny as well as if you get like a cinematic shot of the Corn and I'm like what a beautiful specimen okay let's do it oh it's so perfectly formed that was incredible that's a seven out of ten this might be the corniest video we've ever made let's get this bananas sliced it's about the least satisfying way to open a banana is fruit peeling an ASMR category all right oh my God that's what it's gonna do to the banana through the guillotine are you ready here we go oh perfect slices wow easy eight here all right this might be the greatest Apple product of all time oh I'd say that was probably more palpitation inducing than satisfying but it did work to be fair that is the quickest I've ever sliced an apple I'll give this one a six so these are a highly cost effective way to get your fix but I've heard that kinetic sand can do us one better so this is kind of like moist feeling sand that never dries out that was a great peel they've really nailed the unboxing experience okay so I've just put together some almost perfect looking shapes made of kinetic sand a sound okay pizza cutter is ah do you see how the sand almost has like a fluffy texture to it okay let's do something very strange here that was not what I expected at all it's like a really nice cake has anyone want a corn cookie a bit of a dilemma for this last pile do we grate it or do we put it through a garlic press all right screw it let's do both oh and it looks like some very gone off mozzarella let's just shove it in the garlic press see what happens this is what my training is leaded to oh God it just looks like droppings we've had our fun now the hand towel tablets I really like this bag kind of looks alarmingly like a bag of mints we've got some nice warm water oh my God it literally looks like a mint this has a high probability of being incredibly underwhelming but let's try it three two one oh wow that was so fast that did not disappoint I enjoyed that the fact that they've managed to get a towel that large into a tablet to that size that's actually a feat of engineering whoops oh that is insane but let's ramp this up with the fidget toys I generally think we spent over a hundred dollars on these Spinners let's find out if it was worth it uh this thing is Tiny I'm so excited about this one okay this one is heavy duty very odd I've got no idea how this one works that is a cool design right here's pendulum the way that this thing moves and catches light is actually mesmerizing okay I think I got it okay so it's kind of just like a normal spinner but a little bit more unpredictable six out of ten okay Sonic time wait what he's too fast I'm starting to see Sonic kind of he's still a blur I kind of thought this was going to be more like a flip book with the effect it creates ah I'll give that a bite okay this one can't be bad look how many mechanisms it's got ah that is amazing the pattern it creates continuously changes as the speed changes look how it catches the light easy eight don't really know what to do with you do you spin it ah oh that is nice it feels like an object you shouldn't be able to hold in your hands and then when you start spinning it it's a mess but it always seems to find some sort of equilibrium unexpectedly fun seven out of whoa okay so this is what we paid I want to say fifty dollars for it is very weighty and balanced I'll give it that something gonna happen when we spin it um okay extremely smooth but not fifty dollars come on okay but at the very least apparently if you spin this one the other way around come closer you'll actually hear some music moving on you bought me something oh no oh no I hate it even worse in person I don't want to touch it that's so weird let's take it back okay special pen time very shiny finish and the really interesting thing about this pen is that when we click the button the entire structure of the pen changes I've got no idea how they managed to make it fold up so uniformly but now is stepping up because at forty dollars this is the vortex shaker water and protein powder this really doesn't look like it's going to do much but the company says that apparently the combination of the power of the motor inside of this base with the shape of this blade which actually looks shockingly like a stickman doing a deadlift is enough to create a Vortex on the inside let's try it and find out okay wow that I did not expect you can see it's like a Whirlpool this is so much more pleasant than using a Shaker it's got like a gentle hum to it and nothing spills anywhere it's so clean okay let's try it one thing about that is that is incredibly smooth and that's apparently just the side effect of how this thing goes about mixing your drink man if that's a 40 satisfying Gadget what's a 400 one gonna be like well we're gonna find out soon enough because we're already at a hundred dollars with this maglev platform so apparently this uses an electromagnet that's strong enough to not just levitate the platform but also whatever I put on the platform I actually have a very strange idea what if we try and put a spinning fidget spinner on a spinning levitating platform okay so I'm going to spin the platform clockwise and then I'm gonna spin the fidget spinner counterclockwise I think this will work huh oh my gosh that's crazy did you see that the levitating piece of chicken yeah don't eat from there oh and actually on the topic of levitation this machine can this almost feels like science fiction apparently levitate water we all know how magnets work this is probably the gadget I have the least confidence in oh my God he actually looks like he's traveling upwards had me for a second this might not be coming across perfectly on camera but quite an impressive site so obviously water can't actually be flowing upwards Against Gravity but the way it looks like it works is individual drops of water are falling at a constant rate from here down to here there's a really precise cone at the bottom that's stopping that water splashing and then at the same time there is a strobing light that's basically flashing on and off really really quickly and that makes it kind of like a really sneaky illusion where you're looking at one drop as it's falling but then when the lights go off and then they come back on again you're actually looking at a different drop that's above that drop without realizing it so it looks like the drop has traveled upwards genuinely hypnotic 8.5 out of 10. okay so you remember those fruit Cutters from earlier right well this is basically the baller version of them and now that we've put it all together I can kind of see why so the way this works is you lift up the flap at the back and then you pull open the spring-loaded mechanism and that's when you drop the poor vegetable in such that when you let go of this spring-loaded mechanism it will push the vegetable towards the blades at the end this is actually so heartbreaking there's like a little piece of pepper sticking its way through knowing what's about to happen to it I don't want to be the one to do it oh my gosh each slice is so precise and thin I feel like I can see the cell walls in this it's also surprisingly smooth I just realized what we have to try kinetic sand this could be a match made in heaven I mean to listen out for the sound oh my gosh it's cutting off like a single layer of sand at a time you're either Gonna Love it or you're gonna hate it speaking of sand this might just be the most elaborate sand toy that I ever laid eyes on it's got a slightly cheap 3D printed in someone's garage kind of look to it which for 200 is not the dream anyways sand in turn the machine on and then the only thing left to do is to drop one of these ball bearings in there I'm assuming there's meant to be a magnet on the inside here right my bad there's another switch drop this in see what happens yes look it's like a shark under the sand it's kind of like what I imagine a pet rock would be like okay we'll come back at the end and see what it's done okay we've tested a lot of bleeding edge gadgets over the years we've seen shoes that allow you to physically feel music we've seen infinitely repeating dodecahedrons and working displays the thickness of a piece of paper but this airless paint sprayer right here is up there with one of the most exciting of all for me so let's just say you've moved into a new place you've left your garage door unlocked one night and you have some very friendly neighbors I realize how Niche this scenario is oh Jesus what am I doing I can basically fill this tank with clean white paint oh even that's so satisfying and then this base compartment can effectively suck out all the air and create a vacuum with that paint which means that when I spray from here it should come out as smooth and as quiet as can be this is a proper like industrial bit of kit pushing me well like it's almost gone back to just how the paper used to be and it's so smooth coming out this hose it's the same about that goggling box though it's such a smooth move even coat of paint 7 out of ten I cannot believe that an item like this actually exists and it actually got delivered to us this robot can write for you and I didn't realize I had to build it myself okay that only took us about five hours but it's fully assembled now so I'm just gonna hand it our weird crushed looking pen and then we pull up something called the inkscape software which lets us design any image we want to and then the robot can turn that image into a path that it needs to follow to make it I know the perfect test for this how perfect a circle can a robot draw go haha that was far better than I thought it was gonna do there's something very surreal about seeing that happen it's the fact that yes you can just print things in perfect circles but I have just seen this use a manual instrument and execute that in person I don't see how we can get more satisfying than that give it a nine just in case right this feels like a challenge I'm gonna pull up the same photo of my cat for both the robot and me to see also you can draw it better man vs machines do this is so intimidating not to worry I did art at school and I didn't fail does not look like a cat although I'm slightly concerned it's one of those drawings that's going to come together at the last minute and look incredible oh I just realized what it's doing the whole drawing is upside down and but that is actually incredible maybe I can beat it on speed the worst part of this is it's not just better than me it's also faster so that's what the axi draw robot did here's my cat I only have one thing left to say here it's a good day for Humanity no that's you yeah right there he's more interested in the DVD screensaver 800 800 is the price of this clock it's not made of any spectacularly fancy materials it doesn't tell the time any more accurately than a normal clock but it does have one key differentiator it tells the time with a levitating hand this ball right here so we mount it on the wall I'm really enjoying this led ring around it and we basically set it so that right now it's counting minutes so one whole round is 60 seconds there's an accessory for this so you line that up with that dot and apparently you just slide that in oh my God wait the magnet's moving okay I was too ambitious we need to do it horizontally oh my we got it let me just mount it this is wild I feel like I'm inside of a Harry Potter movie it's even like rotating on the spot okay so check this out we can set the timer to one minute each second it moves along you can even see the LED follow it around and the cool thing about this is that you can set one round of this clock to mean anything you want it to mean so it could count a week it could count a month it could count just towards a specific point in time in the future that you're looking forward to which is a feature I love a hundred dollars though I know time is money but this is something else getting to the very highest end gadgets now this is the Miku formulas and it's been talked about on the internet as the Pinnacle the literal climax for satisfaction Seekers the idea being that let's say you've just designed a product of your own then you can place that product inside of it and use this to create a mold of it to efficiently recreate it as many times as you want I mean the outcome is cool and all but it's more the way that it goes about it that's the fun bit so our Mouse right here is effectively sitting on a vacuum that's going to suck out all the air it's actually just a Henry the Hoover but you may do and then on top of that is a plastic sheet that is now being heated from a filament above and as soon as that gets to the right temperature we're going to bring that Plastics down wow oh my God it's created a complete seal around that product that's the day when we get to actually print the mice as well how do we get the mouse out I do actually need my mouse back this is how I'm gonna use it from now on well the good news is that I can still move my mouse the slightly less good news is that I can no longer press buttons or scroll Wheels but this is a video that just keeps giving if you asked a random person on the street to design their ideal piece of technology I imagine that a printer that can 3D print chocolate would be pretty high on the list so it comes with these really strange chocolate cigar looking things in the box which you basically shove up the nozzle at the bottom and then we just browse the various different folders of things we could potentially print and you can do chess pieces I love chess let's print a rook so it's moving both the nozzle and the tray underneath it to create the shape look how precise the square is this is my kind of machine and it's almost completely silent and here is our Rook wow so it looks like it's had some trouble with the base of it but the rest of it is spot on it's so precisely crafted but this actually goes further because you can also add in your own SD card loaded with any 3D model you can find on the internet and apparently I can print that too so of course we're going to try a Pokemon okay see if they can make a Bulbasaur oh it's the inside of Bulbasaur don't think I'd ever see that and you can tell this time right the machine's even got the base right I cannot wait to see this one eternity later yeah so basically we ran out of chocolate part way through printing that so we have a headless Bulbasaur over here oh yeah a very very nice headless Bulbasaur but then the cool part of this is that we've managed to print one Bulbasaur in many many different sizes it's like a very weird semi-headless family I'll eat the biggest one the texture is so fun you can feel every single layer is built on the inside yeah it's something special there you go bulb is all for you cooking with moments of immense satisfaction I had another one the other day you might know that when I went to go see Mr Beast earlier this year he got me addicted to anime he showed me a series called Death Note on Netflix which I finished beginning to end in a month and I'm currently looking for the next one to binge open to recommendations by the way also isn't it kind of insane how this is actually automatically spread out all the satin the problem is you can't find half of these shows on the UK version of Netflix so imagine the feeling when I realized that I could use the surfshark VPN subscription that I already had and already used to encrypt my internet traffic and monitor my email address in real time for any data leaks to just swap my location to the United States to access the US version of Netflix which did have those shows on it but the crazy part of it is that this whole surf shark package together is just 249 a month which split between the seven people I share it with is 36 Cents so hit the link in the description and use the code boss and you'll get it not just for that 249 a month price but also three extra months for free on top of that fully refundable

most futuristic Tech on the internet and then we're going to test it to find out if it actually is the future or if it's all just marketing nonsense so what's the first thing I'd want to futurize a TV oh of course xiaomi released a transparent TV I knew this was a thing already I didn't realize you could actually just click by okay I have like a billion questions about this we got to try it what are the things we expect the future will have how about this uh invisibility bu oh this is great yes we need to do an invisibility Shield if you haven't seen one of these already it's going to feel like magic futuristic bike I remember seeing this a while ago on the internet as like a concept device that could hypothetically exist 3,496 it's like $4,000 there's no way we can have the opportunity to test something like that and then not do it what would a person from the future use as their tools the Neo ruler rule rule the scales didn't realize the battle for rulers was that intense so this thing is claiming to be a speaker that can focus its sound output directly to one person and the whole speaker is made of glass as well this is so futuristic gy ooh that's interesting so it's like a smart mirror but it's also saying that it contains your beautiful new personal trainer benefit from AI powered form feedback live body tracking and rep Counting all in a hologram wall mirror I'd be dumb not to give it a go we can't do a futuristic Tech video without a robot uh so this is world's first direct drive self-balancing wheel legged robot feels like they really wanted to be first at something I say that but this actually looks amazing I don't think I've ever seen a robot with this level of agility okay well this one has my attention um you can ride it hey 8 m per hour I'll never miss a flight again oh wait it seems like the same company also has another suitcase that follows you add two bag M the new Rayband meta smart glasses I have heard that these glasses are the best implementation of the smart glasses concept to ever exist how close can you get to a real life hologram nowadays you can actually get something called the Looking Glass portrait oh it's the only commercially available display on the market that's able to Showcase 3D cont content without the need for eye tracking or glasses I'm still very confused but this is the kind of thing we need to test I remember this company wooder they make these like haptic vests so you wear them and you plug yourself into like a game you're playing and that suddenly allows you to feel the game you're playing and it looks like they've managed to condense that experience that previously would have involved you wearing this basically jumpsuit to just a strap speaking of straps one strap endless possibilities flexible to stiff with a with a Twist yeah boy okay marketing aside this actually looks like a really impressive this actually looks like a really really impressive product like it allows you to wear your phone around your neck or around your wrist or around your waist and then just twist it to make it stiff oh actually I do know a tech company whose entire thing is being futuristic gravar this is cool this is my Jem [Music] there's a whole category of speakers called ferof fluid speakers they use a magnetic fluid to create a visual response to music these pencils have a really interesting mechanism that allows them to self [Music] sharpen okay stop me I don't think I've ever been this excited for the stuff to arrive it's all finally here some of this stuff took over 2 months to arrive so in a way we very much are filming this in the future so let's go roughly from least expensive to the most expensive to find out how much it really costs to experience that next era so just $10 self sharpening mechanical pencils so you know when you're using a normal pencil the reason it gets blunt is cuz as you're writing you're holding the pencil from one consistent angle and kind of sanding away at the tip so these guys realize how to fix that by creating a system such that every single time you apply and remove pressure from the tip it rotates the lead so that even if you're writing from one consistent angle you're actually equally using every side of the pencil there's really not much to say about it apart from the fact that it really does work and every pencil should use one of these the entire sharpening industry would disappear so I'm going to give this a 6 out of 10 so then all the way up at $60 we have the futuristic charger from gravar and actually while we're at it let's just do all the gra Star Products so that's the earbuds and speaker wa if nothing else it all looks cool let's hope there's more to it than that okay so the charger it doesn't initially strike me as the most space efficient with this whole transforming standing sitting design like they've used a really high-tech material called gallium nitride to be able to get it to a really condensed size but then bulked it back up again with all the external fluff Like It's a 65 W charger which is not bad that's two times faster than the iPhone's fast charger but then at the same time if all you wanted was a 65 W power brick you can get one in a smaller footprint at a lower price it's not really futuristic you're paying for design you're paying for these rotating ears is you're paying for the fact that the eyes light up you're paying for the fact that it transforms from a sitting to a standing position but actually only if you don't have your plug in on top of that because then it's locked in 5 out of 10 but then with the earbuds the design actually has a purpose these things feel so premium like listen to these sounds oh it's got an RGB lighting strip baked into the charging case of the earphones you can very much tell this is made for someone who really wants to carry around a gadget let's do a sound test they do fit really well with a good amount to passive noise cancellation without any Tech going on that's a bit of a shame the one airphone that is working does sound pretty good but the fact that straight out of the box one of them isn't connecting properly it's not a great sign for the software stability to come but you know what the funniest thing is you know the main extra function of this earb Cas there's a bottle opener I couldn't believe it let's uh let's see if it works whose idea was this I mean earphones bottle opener the kinds of situations that you would use both of those in are so different but also more importantly was it worth this was it worth carving out a massive triangle in this valuable real estate that is your charging case at the direct cost of battery futuristic in a Dumb Way 3 out of 10 that's nice though but the speaker is the thing that I'm most excited for I'm already liking a lot of the little touches like these tiny little rubber pads at the bottom which means when you plunk it on a table it massively softens the thud okay cool ready to pair Lo connected I can respect that some nice startup sounds oh there's a ton of different lighting modes as well you know for something that's designed to be straight out of a sci-fi movie This is actually weirdly well suited to Camping ah okay so it's got a small Tweeter here which is what's handling the high notes and then a larger subwofer coming out the bottom which is what's handling the base and it's pretty mid-range to be honest it sounds like a $50 speaker the lighting's cool though so I'll give it a five all right let's see what the lighting of the future has in store for us this is the bioluminescent and all and I got to say I do love the idea of a future where we're not just pumping out greenhouse gases to fuel our increasingly electric Lifestyles but actually harnessing the Earth's natural resources to live a sustainable life and this might actually be one step closer to that Vision so apparently in this bag right here is a specific species of live microalgae that can take in carbon dioxide release oxygen kind of like a plant so I just dropped some on my table but also in that process produce light emitting chemicals so we basically pour what's left into the orb I'm going to leave that in a place where it's getting plenty of light for now and then what it says is that it's only going to Glow not just in the dark but specifically at nighttime so we will just cover the other stuff and loop back to it at the end oh I've just realized there's a massive do not drink on the front which means someone's tried it I could totally see how you'd think this would be a superhero origin story I don't blame you I'm slightly curious okay and while we wait to see the kind of lighting that nature can generate let's find out what humans are to do because this product right here claims to have bottled both fire and the Northern Lights into something that can sit on your shelf okay so really all this is is's a bunch of high power LEDs at the bottom shooting up at a deformed glass cylinder which refracts them and I mean there is stuff to like here like the glass cylinder is surprisingly high quality the reflections it makes on the walls and especially the ceiling really genuinely interesting to the point where I would say it kind of delivers on its prominis plus you get a little remote to change the colors I really like this one it reminds me so much of the Reflections coming off water but here's the thing I hate these remotes these remotes are a sign that what you actually have at the core of this product is very cheap LEDs for me Tech that is genuinely smart is Tech that will use your phone or voice for controlling but the more fundamental problem is that this was meant to rotate by itself there's a motor there and when it arrived it was already fried which does not bode well for the overall quality of this thing so the idea is great it can be pretty but I this is just a bit sad isn't it 4 out of 10 at $80 then we have what's claiming to be the future of the phone stand and while initially I could not wrap my head around how a phone stand could possibly be $80 now I can see it this is the morph strap you know the whole flexible to stiff thing yeah it's that now the company's being pretty tight lipped about how exactly it works but it seems like this lever here is basically a crank that tightens or loosens the internal structure sitting under this fabric so the company's idea is let's say you're walking around on holiday and you carry your phone around your neck as you do the second you want to take a photo bam selfie stick I'll be it a slightly bent one I mean that's not really what I'd use it for what I'm more interested in is can this be a way to mount your phone onto like any surface to take a weird shot for example the answer to which is yeah pretty much I just had an idea so I'm thinking hypothetically if I was in the back seat of a car and I wanted to watch a TV show while I'm on the go does work 7 out of 10 I feel like there's a lot more you can do with this than I've even realized at this point and then to measure how long your stiff phone strap is here's the ne ruler which is such an awesome name for what seems to be the one ruler to ruler the all you place the ruler next to it you raise the slider till you reach the point you want to measure and then that on screen is the exact measurement and there's an obvious initial question here in that my $1 ruler does the exact same thing who asked for them to over complicate it this much well for starters this thing is accurate to the nearest 0 01 mm which is a level of precision that you can't get by just eyeing it the fact that it's digital means that you can change units on the Fly you can flip between millimeters inches even meters if you want to but also you can do crazy stuff like let's say you're measuring an architect's drawing or a map for example I just bought one yesterday and it's just a bit bigger than I was expecting so you know a lot of these drawings have a scale right like uh 1 to 500,000 or in the case of this map 1 to 5 you can let the ruler know that scale and then as you're measuring it will not just tell you how many millimeters it is in reality but also what the actual real life distances of that space really are or for another example let's say that you wanted to divide something evenly you can choose on this ruler how many divisions you want and then you literally just pull the slider across and it will tell you exactly where to make those divisions Niche yes completely next level for the people who actually have use for it also yes 8 out of 10 so now on the complete other end of the spectrum our shoes yeah apparently Future shoes only come with half the packaging so we already know that this shoe it bends in half but why well this entire range of Fes products was actually inspired by a letter from Matthew waltzer a 16-year-old living with cerebral pulsy who said that because of his disability he couldn't tie Nike's shoelaces so Nike set themselves an internal challenge to basically try and create a pair of shoes that you could take off with no hands and this actually requires quite a big rethink of how the shoe works like you need a h H that allows the shoe to snap into the open and closed positions you need this tension band that spans both sections you need to make sure that the sole stays flat when the shoe opens so that it doesn't form a crease and then on top of that a kickstand which is what actually allows you to kick the shoe into this folded position so how well does it actually work it's a real life product showcase it's Mor strap time Crank that into position there you go look at that it's the cameraman of the Future Okay so foot slides into this top half it feels pretty loose right now but then wow all of a sudden that's like a perfect fit that's the easiest shoe putting on experience I've ever had and then when you want to take it off a little bit of pressure at the bottom there and your shoe folds in half that's crazy I was skeptical but now I am completely sold at least on the vision it's yet to be determined if all these extra moving Parts add any extra fragility to the shoe but this is a concept that I want to see more companies trying 9 out of 10 so I've tried haptic vest before but what's really interesting to me about this wua strap is how it's got the potential to still add another dimension to games and music without having to look like you're gearing up to go to actual War okay so the way this works is it basically sits in between your Sound Source let's say your PS5 and then your sound output let's say your headphones it intercepts that audio and then it turns the low notes which could be gunfire or you crashing into the wall in a car into physical impact that you can feel and then passes on the rest of the audio for your headphones to play as usual it does have physical ports for when you want to manually wire something in like I've done for my PS5 controller but it is also fully Bluetooth so that's how it's paired to these headphones would you look at that oh and then there's also an app where you can control volume you can control intensity obviously we're on the maximum but also you can control RGB color which feels a little silly for me for a device intended to not actually be looked at I'm feeling so much impact just from the standard loungy Jazzy menu music you know this is the kind of product that is very easy to write off as a gimmick but I would actually say as far as the experience of feeling like you're in a car this goes probably further than one of those like steering wheel accessories that I've seen a lot of people buy like I feel like I'm feeling the real texture of the road and the grunt of the engine I guess if you're a massive car Enthusiast You' also probably notice the way that different cars feel physically okay I'm just going to go for it I'm just going to ster off into [Music] the oh okay so the actual final impact was not actually as much as I thought it was going to be I don't think this has the single-handed ability to deliver the authentic car crash experience this probably isn't the way to make it feel like if you're playing Cod that you're actually heading into a real war zone but what it is is a really effective way of adding in that General lower level immersion that you probably don't realize you're missing until you take one of those off I wasn't woed Jud okay also around this price the invisibility Shield let's have a look so this is how the thing comes and I know it looks like I just went to my dumpster I pulled out a sheet of corrugated plastic and I stuck it here but no this is a specially crafted material where every single one of these vertical strips is a curved lens that bends light away from the center which has the very surreal implication that you could be looking head on at something and not actually be able to see it which is useful for I mean yes magic tricks but also stuff like camouflage in the military I wouldn't say it's useful for most people but from the perspective of it being a working science lesson in action given eight and then even more futuristic than that the holographic display very few things scream future like hologram but then I suppose at the same time we have seen so many poor executions of this concept it makes it feel like you're physically holding a memory in your hands and you're able to look around within it it almost feels like a very good trailer for immersive content so stage one of what this thing can do is turn a 2D image into a 3D image so this right here is a normal photo that I took on my iPhone and look at this the software actually allows you to visualize what it's like to look around inside it using Ai and look what happens when I pick up this depth in a slider and drag it across you can actually see the image being manipulated in real time it's kind of a shame that the actual resolution of the output isn't higher but at the same time to help you visualize how impressive this is you know those holographic bookmarks you get where when you look from different angles you can see the same image from like four different perspectives this is kind of like that but instead of there being four different perspectives it feels like an unlimited number of perspectives like it's literally 100 on top of the fact that it's actually a moving screen but there is also a level up to this so this program is also connected to chat gbt and can apparently allow you to talk to AI connected to a holographic character within this Frame right so if I select the robot well now ain't that just a hot tamale of Technology spill the beans and let's have a hooden NY this is weird so this thing has the intelligence of the AI models that we know but it's actually also able to communicate that within its own pre-programmed personality I'm like shaking a little bit you got it partner if x + 69 is 72 what is X well hot diggity dog if x + 69 is 72 then I reckon X is a sneaky little vmit trying to hide in plain sight what but fear not partner cuz this old cartoon Android is quick on the draw if we subtract 69 from 72 we find that X is a mischievous Little Critter equal to three what a weird way of saying three what's your favorite Mr Who's The Boss video well ain't that a Nutty question no it does feel like a bit of a demo piece in its current form um in that it's not a final product with a particular purpose but equally I am shocked right now my brain is spinning with all the things this could potentially mean for the future like like imagine if you had like a table with this technology and you were playing holographic board games with the person sitting opposite you each of you having a different Viewpoint of the same situation oh my God this is a 10 out of 10 this is a taste of the future a solid 10 out of 10 partner trippy as hell right one of the things that I think about a lot when it comes to the future is how language barriers just won't be a thing Tech will be able to make it so that you can still have completely seamless conversations with people who otherwise you would never have understood it's just a question of when so are these that product that can take us there okay so drisha you are a Spanish speaker well you have spoken Spanish at some point in your life yeah this is going to test my high school Spanish High School Spanish okay that's good enough so you put one earbud in I'm going to put the other earbud in and there's a mode here we're going to click called simil mode hello how are you today gra you're hearing what I'm saying can I have a loaf of bread please what's it saying to you that's what it comes up as oh my God okay so this is not completely new tech like it's not dissimilar in Translation ability to something like Google translate but it's the form factor it's the fact that I can have one airb you can have one a bird and the microphone is really close to your mouth so it picks up the sound well and then it's the app it's the app that doesn't require you to keep pressing buttons it just listens out and allows you to have that conversation in real time we've used the Google app a few times to try and talk to people who don't talk English and it's kind of like tap wait tap wait when you're using Google translate you very much feel like you're using an app here you just feel like you're looking at the person and talking to the person yeah and I can see this slowly being added into things like glasses Apple Vision to make it seem more seamless as opposed to like going on holiday and giving it to someone that is such a good point of course that's going to happen could be really cool it's a good enough product that this is going straight in my travel bag and it can also do 40 languages and 93 accents right now the two things I don't like are that one the app tries to charge you for downloading languages offline which when you're in abroad countries is probably a likely thing you're going to have to do and then also the actual Hardware construction feels a little bit cheap for the price these are like if they were just normal earphones you would expect them to cost no more than like $50 for a build like this so overall it's an eight time for The Meta glasses which obviously I mean they're not a cheap product but at the same time given how expensive a normal pair of glasses from this company is and how far ahead the metag glasses supposedly are I was expecting this to be much more okay so let's be very clear what this isn't is some completely straight out of a movie pair of augmented reality glasses where like I can see you and then like your name and your age next to you we're not there yet but what it is is a pair of real and rather stylish glasses or sunglasses that you can put onto your face connect to your phone and make phone tasks more seamless than they already were like music they've got speakers that angle down into your ears and okay I mean there's not exactly an established scale for how good glasses should sound but I would say the audio quality is not far off something like the third gen airpods you control things using this capacitive area on the side here like scrolling volume for example and then there's a capture button up top for the cameras for both photo and video you can also use voice commands but I mean imagine standing in a packed train like meta take a photo here's the thing that shocked me the photos and videos that you take on this are actually good it's not quite like topend smartphone but this thing takes 12 map photos and 1080p videos using some of the same processing techniques that your smartphone uses like HDR like the stabilization so you don't get Overexposed Skies or everything covered in Shadow like I expected coming into this the key downside for me though is that the camera is not going to cover your entire vision and you can't preview what it's capturing like you can on your phone so it will sometimes result in a situation where you shoot something you later realize before you post it that actually you want to crop it a little bit to make it central but then at that point it's actually more effort than if you had just taken your phone out in the moment and done it properly but I do want to stress this is exciting it's the first product in its category that's actually I would say delivered on its promise and feels like a polished finished product that you could see yourself using so I would give this a nine and now moving further up the ladder the concept of this next one is absolutely Bonk as if it works a speaker that can focus its sound in one area is like the entire perks of the isolation you get with headphones combined with the free of being able to listen to something by speakers and actually while we're at it let's just do this at the same time as the ferrofluid speaker since unlike the name suggests it's not actually a speaker but it's designed to react to a speaker it's hard for me to describe how excited I actually am for this this is one of those very big moments where I'm actually experienced something for the first time that could be groundbreaking test and I want to start by saying this ferrofluid thing over here even without how it reacts to music just using a magnet over it is fascinating it's basically a magnetic fluid but because you never really see magnets in fluid form it almost shows you magnetism in action in a way that's much more real than you all have ever seen with solids that said the actual product feels like it needs a bit of quality control like there's some ferof fluid just stuck to the inside of the glass it's LED back lip oh my God it's responding to my voice I have never in my life seen anything like that before okay so we'll put that there and now the focus sound this is a very weird piece of technology it genuinely looks like nothing is going on in here it's a really light completely clear speaker with just a little bit of a metal body so I imagine almost all of the audio processing and the actual Tech is happening in this box here this is just the projector for the sound okay immediate first impression right now it's firing directly at me it's not the most Bassy or Punchy speaker but I can hear it very clearly I'm going to turn it away now oh my goodness oh my God I had never experienced anything like that in my life so when you're looking directly at the speaker you're convinced The Sound Source is here but as soon as you rotate it it feels like it's almost throwing the audio source to that wall there or that wall there so when you turn the speaker away from you it's not like it completely mutes it but you're probably hearing it at about 25% of the volume versus when it's facing you so how well the way that normal soundwaves work is they travel out in all directions until they dissipate imagine like throwing a rock into a p and seeing those ripples come out of it but this directional audio speaker actually instead uses ultrasonic waves which are super high frequency and therefore much shorter wavelength which means they spread out much less they're completely inaudible to the human ear but the thing is as soon as they come into contact with the Human air they distort back into an audible frequency so the target can hear the audio but the other people around them can't as much is it worth buying I'd say probably not yet given that you're having to give up a lot of sound quality to be able to get this effect but but the potential is massive so for the purposes of being futuristic that's a 9 out of 10 and this ferof fluid speaker surprisingly cool this is an eight this is the airwheel SR5 the auto following suitcase and then this is the SE 3s which is the ridable suitcase I actually really fancy a sit right now so we're going to start with the ridable one and I got to say I don't think I've ever wanted to like a product this much like okay when in your life have you ever seen this before bombastic side eye there's a massive power bank attached to the back of it which means that you can plug your phone in to charge it and then you sit down on the thing and I mean come I mean when you think about what riding around on a Suitcase looks like I don't think you'd imagine this level of speed and turning torque this is literally like Rainbow Road in Mario Kart wo you got one toggle that's accelerate you got one toggle that's a break but the best bit is what happens when you press both together this is how you go through airport securitya you've got the app for this suitcase yeah I can see how fast you're how fast am I going you're joking it feels a lot faster than that what TR stop this is really weird oh it just says God uh D out okay yeah so on one hand right nothing beats this but then on the other hand as a functioning suitcase there's a room for improvement so I mean for starters they make you carry around this ridiculous butt pad which really they could have just baked into [Music] it I don't know what kind of holiday you can pack for in there at a squeeze that's two shoes and maybe a butt Pad Plus like the website for this thing is so atrocious that I have no faith that any other the tech in this is actually going to last and then we have the autof following suitcase this is the one that from a technical perspective I was actually looking forward to more but it's actually quite a lot worse so it has very similar perks to the other one in that because it's got a massive battery Bank it can charge your phone it's actually also got a biometric fingerprint scanner for unlocking but the key differentiator is this wrist wrap so this wrist strap essentially communicates with this sensor via Ultra wideband which is like the same technology that your iPhone uses to find your air tags for example so I am now connected which means if I walk more than 5 meters away then like an overly attached child it will come sprinting to me can it outrun me that's the question oh nearly obstacle avoidance on point so this is part of what my problem with the product is these two down here are infrared obstacle avoidance sensors they're not very good at avoiding obstacles do you trust the technology with your life go go go BR it slowed down so the problem is not that it's unimpressive it's actually pretty cool that it works most of the time it's just that for your most valuable possessions it has to be 100% and it doesn't feel like from what I've used it that I trust it completely there are a couple of safeguards in place like for example as soon as you lose it your wrist starts beeping and your suitcase just starts wandering around and around like that looking for the sensor but still you only have to lose something once and I feel like this will do it 5 out of 10 right right it's magic mirror time so I started using this thing a couple of days ago and it's a really unique product but I think the best way to show you is to actually start a workout and you'll see how it works and I will say they have got the fundamentals right like the software feels very slick it runs at a good frame rate although just because of what the product is you do get this slight ghosting type effect it's almost like it's an infinity mirror of bouncing back and forwards which reduces the crispness a little bit so the first thing you do is you pick a class so you can either pick it based on the duration you can pick it on who's leading that class or you can pick it based on what body part you feel like working out it's got a whole load of different settings you can play around with and what I like about it is that it's not assuming that you have access to an entire gym Suite it's very much able to tweak itself around what you do have and now we go and now it initializes body tracking it's just making sure there's one person and one person only in the frame so when I saw this for the first time I will say as a fan of Technology this felt pretty cool you've got all these Fitness instructors who've clearly filmed themselves on a green screen background so they've been able to cut it all out and almost appear like they holographically there in your room but it actually gets cooler cuz you click right here and you have access to music and every bit of music outputed by this mirror is generated by AI so every time you do a workout you are hearing different tracks and then part of why that helps is that you can separate the music volume from the speech and sound effects volumes because yes it talks to you like let's say I am actually following along to this workout it will tell me off when I'm doing it wrong bring the weight up to your shoulders right so is it good well there's a lot of things I like about it I like the fact that it gamifies workouts I like the fact that it feels like there's almost a watchful eye over you so that you have some company and it does smart things like when you first input the weights that you're lifting it will slowly use artificial intelligence to amp up the workouts to make sure that you're progressing the bone that I have to pick though is with the way it's marketed this thing calls itself a personal trainer replacement but really what this is is an oversized smartphone with a front camera with a screen with a set of speakers that does use intelligent software to watch you but it can't see every angle and you can obviously trick this if you want to like it currently says I've done seven BP curls I haven't done seven bicep curls 2 plus 2 is four this isn't a complete replacement for a personal trainer but it is really good for people who don't have access to one so 8 out of 10 you know cycling used to be such a massive part of my life growing up and so this idea of me revisiting it now but using something that looks like it's straight out of Tron legacy is kind of crazy okay we have to talk about this product is it futuristic yes hell yes this thing is straight out of my bike driving fantasies from when I was a kid like for example it has a kickstand that no joke once activated can only be deactivated with fingerprint access it's got a microchip inside of it that will alert your phone if it ever gets stolen and it will give you the exact GPS coordinates to go find it it's got integrated signal and brake lights so you don't have to wave your arms around like this when you're gesturing that you want to turn right and then also headlamps that are sensitive to the light in the en so they only turn on when they're needed and all of this stuff is great like using Tech to make the biking experience safer that's exactly what it needs and then you have the elephant in the room hubless Wheels how is it that every single bike you've seen up until this point has a Hub in the middle but this one doesn't well they've actually not really done away with the Hub you still need one they've just redesigned it and relocated it so that everything that was previously Happening Here is now happening in a combination of here and then here does it have any practical benefit at all no it doesn't and that brings me on to the problem the whole thing is very surface level like it's very heavy it's got this really cheap feeling plastic coating that we actually ended up accidentally scratching earlier just trying to clean it as far as the actual electric bike performance it's really nothing special like it's nothing better than what you could get on a $1,000 or maybe even $700 electric bike the thing has basically no suspension every single bump you go over you feel it but by far the worst part of this is the tech is basically dysfunctional we couldn't get the app to connect we couldn't get any of the smart features to work customer service non-existent the company doesn't even seem to be properly operational anymore making this essentially the most expensive prop I've ever bought in my life and I'm really upset to be honest $4,600 that's where we're at right now and for that well this Diablo robot really has to be something special right let's just get one thing out the way this is a very impressive product like it's one thing to be able to balance as a human but to achieve that in a two-legged machine that requires very high intelligence it requires the robot to be able to constantly know exactly where its limbs are and also be able to correct itself in an instant the second something moves out of syn you know when you move it it feels so powerful like it could take me out if I accidentally oh God I'm actually a bit scared now I'm not sure in my life I've ever used a piece of Robotics that feels this powerful so this is making me think of a couple of month ago where I tested this for the first time it's a DJI Robo master and I genuinely thought at the time this is as Extreme as toys get but that makes this very much look like Child's Play but also it can jump you ready oh my goodness me let's do a backwards jump which all begs the question why like what is this for and the way I see it the best use of a robot that can't seem to fall fall over is to carry stuff right so the mission Coke on the robot and I'm going to try and deliver that coke to drer on the chair everyone's telling me not to do this she's watching with baited breath this is absolutely phenomenal okay you ready just swipe it you got it you got it you got it you got it you got it yes other thing we need to test here is carrying capacity so you can maximize it by going into the creeping mode as opposed to the standing mode uh I probably shouldn't get on prish it works do you want to have a race just going to give you a morph strap for when I Blaze ahead of you should be on you so that you can catch me winning no no no no no no [Music] yes oh how do you stop oh oh and the final added benefit is we now have a new robot to control our camera shots wow this is abs absolutely insane this robot's got to be a nine at nearly $110,000 then welcome to world's first ever mass produced transparent TV and actually now we're here I do just want to show you one more thing you might have heard me talking about when we overtake apple and subscribers we're going to build this massive iPhone unlike the world has ever seen well essentially we've started building it we're working with another YouTuber called DIY perks the guy who made that crazy phone shelf what oh my and long story short it's going to be mindblowing like just to give you an idea the camera on the phone is an actual proper DSLR camera and that's just the icing on the cake we're closing in on Apple but we just need a little bit of help getting there so if you enjoy our videos at all and you want to see this masterpiece of a foam come together then a sub to the channel would be transformative all right so the TV itself I mean this is every bit as cool and futuristic as I was hoping it would be it's basically like a normal TV you've got a layer of glass a trans ucent layer of OLED pixels then another layer of glass except that the way the blacks are represented is by transparency and insanely cool as that is it does create a bit of a paradox when you're watching content like for example if it does what a TV does best and produces really bright vibrant striking visuals then it's not doing a very good job of being a transparent TV and if it does a very good job of being a transparent TV then it's doing a less good job than a non-transparent TV the limitations are very obvious like how paired back the resolution had to be this is only a 1080p screen which stretched out on a 55in panel is not the sharpest but that doesn't mean I'm not glad this exists like combine this Tech with electrochromic glass which is what tinted windows use to tint themselves and you maybe do actually have something big on your hands this isn't a practical TV but I mean the way I'm looking at it it's kind of a piece of art so I'm going to give it a seven all right just before night time where we test the orb I want to show you our final futuristic Gadget this is the insta 360 X3 camera see here's the thing in most major cities trying to use a drone to get cinematic shots of the city is strictly prohibited but drones are not the only way to get drone like footage get one of these X3 cameras stick it onto one of the company's 3 m invisible selfie sticks and the camera basically uses some very clever software trickery to remove that selfie stick from the image giving the impression of a floating camera that follows you around at all times it's quite funny actually it's become this whole Trend like you can literally go on to Instagram now and search no drone no problem and you will see thousands of people who've taken stuff like this and you would actually be hardpressed to tell that it's not taken on a high-end drone and here is my attempt at the same thing that is pretty cool and if you want to try it for yourself I have got us basically the best deal that you can get in the description right now with a 10% discount off the product a 128 GB SD card and the invisible selfie stick you need to actually take shots like this okay it's biow time and we can't see anything so far of note it just looks a little yellow but if we turn the light off you can't see anything now out but now I'm going to shake it oh my God that's amazing it seems like they react to motion to a human eye it's very impressive but then I suppose how often are you going to sit there rotating your bulb I'll give it a six"

While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains. Since the 1960's, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time. But this process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics. In a Nutshell - By Kurzgesagt A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things. Representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms. Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors. A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming through. This information is made up of bits which can be set to either 0 or 1. Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates which still do very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and a output of 0 otherwise. Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding two numbers. Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything. Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions. A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda. However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky. In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch. Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another. So, a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction. Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell. As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called Quantum Tunneling. In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense. We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress. To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers. In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information. Quantum computers use qubits which can also be set to one of two values. A qubit can be any two level quantum system, such as a spin and a magnetic field, or a single photon. 0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photons horizontal or vertical polarization. In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once. This is called superposition. But as soon as you test its value, say, by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized. So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predit which it'll be. But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states. Superposition is a game changer. Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time. That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one. Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit. Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel. A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is Entanglement, a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other's state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart. This means when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of it's partners without having to look. Qubit Manipulation is a mind bender as well. A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output. A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output. So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities, then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of 0s and 1s. What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup, all done at the same time. Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results and it'll only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double check and try again. But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer. So, while quantum computers will not probably not replace our home computers, in some areas, they are vastly superior. One of them is database searching. To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries. Quantum computers algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases, is a huge difference The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security. Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode. The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key. Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error. But a quantum computer with exponential speed-up could do it in a breeze. Another really exciting new use is simulations. Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures, such as molecules, they often lack accuracy. So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics? Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine. Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a specallized tool, or a big revolution for humanity. We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.

successful public housing programs in the world hdb is now looking to high-tech innovative solutions to not only provide enough living spaces for singapore citizens but also improved quality of life for decades to come we have very sophisticated computer models that help the architect planner to improve the environmental quality in the town so for example singapore is in the tropics so we want to encourage the breezes to come through through computer simulation you can actually position the blocks and the public spaces in the parks in such a way that help you to achieve this [Music] singapore does very long-term comprehensive planning and that is very important you are looking at the development of singapore 40 years ahead of time and this is important because it ensures that we have sufficient land safeguarded to meet all our development needs singapore is planning decades ahead in such a land scarce nation the question is often not what to build but where to build [Music] singapore's urban redevelopment authority is in charge of identifying the future needs of all singapore's land it's the kind of challenge that draws in the adventurous and the curious i'm very much an urban person the city is close to my heart and even more so having worked in detail on the plans over the last 20 over years for andrew and the ura sometimes that work means creating land from nothing a process known as land reclamation since independence in 1965 singapore has used reclamation to increase its land mass by about 23 percent one of the most striking examples of this and perhaps a vision that cities across the world may adopt is singapore's marina bay a vast engineering project that has been decades in the making [Music] when i first started work with ura marina bay was just a vacant tract of land it was only maybe 10-15 years ago that we actively started development of the area andrew was part of the team that drew up the plan for marina bay and translated it into reality its development dramatically increased the footprint of singapore but it was designed with the needs of its citizens in mind the traditional central business district just comprises of office space then is only used nine to five five days a week so as we've planned marina bay we've also looked to bring in complementary uses so the idea is you create a mix use precinct that the activities carry on 24 7 and seven days a week to make the round-the-clock marina bay model work the ura needed infrastructure in landscape singapore that meant going underground using precision designed layers of essential services including water and electrical tunnels pedestrian and commercial spaces transportation infrastructure like highways and subways and even telecommunications super highways these hidden underground systems have been designed to meet the needs of singapore for the next 50 years but some in singapore are looking beyond that already imagining the cities of the far future i actually think that the future of singapore is not just about increasing the density around transportation nodes of activity i actually think it's about exploring air rights as well jason pomeroy has grand visions for his city the award-winning architect of singapore's first zero carbon house the bee house his designs are pushing the boundaries of how singapore might look more than 50 years from now think about creating structures over roads over motorways topping up above existing structures the rooftops today might be sky court sky gardens of recreation if cities expand upwards into the skies conventional methods of road transportation may no longer be effective perhaps the future of urban transportation will play a major part in shaping the way we live and then all of a sudden you're going to need to think about how to get people up there you know if you were to fast forward 50 years from now we already see drone technology becoming so advanced why are we not sticking people into those drones again a bit like blade runner all of a sudden your sky courts your sky gardens even your private terraces to your condo is actually a landing platform for your own personalized drone though the idea of us flying to work may be decades away drone technology is advancing rapidly and could become integral to the evolution of transportation in the cities of tomorrow in singapore the government has thrown its support behind an advanced program to test the limits of drone capabilities in the world's rapidly expanding urban environments [Music] skyways is airbus's project that is exploring this urban air delivery domain or basically cargo delivery with drones project [Music] the drone that we're using is actually fully customized or fully designed by our team here in singapore to ensure maximum safety in the air the drones have multiple aerospace grade navigation systems so that if one system malfunctions it can rely on others to fly to its destination [Music] the packages that we can deliver by design today is up to four kilograms what we understand is that four kilograms would cover perhaps about eighty eighty five percent of all the packages that are parcel deliveries that are done today once the package has been delivered to its slot the mailbox automatically sends a personalized code to the customer so they can pick up the package 24 7. and just like that also comes back [Music] in airbus one of our visions is what we call urban air mobility so flying taxis for example skyways is about enabling this technology it's about looking and moving towards a future where we have than a flying transportation means in an unread setting singapore innovators are imagining and experimenting the what's next for urban travel drone technology may be the next revolution liberating commuters from their two-dimensional travel but the challenges facing all of our cities may be more elemental than where we will build and how to get around providing food and water for the millions of people that will pack into our urban environments could be the biggest challenge yet [Music] as urban populations rise the world will face unprecedented challenges how to house transport and most importantly feed its people in the future as rural populations decrease ensuring food stability will be key in landscape singapore it's a challenge that is already being confronted right now 93 of produce is imported in to singapore and that's because there just simply isn't enough land to do farming practices benjamin swann came to singapore as an engineer on the marina bay sands project but having fallen in love with the city he recognized a challenge and an opportunity to help the nation towards its goal of food sustainability ben is developing a new way to grow food not just in singapore but in any urban environment sustanair is a controlled environment agriculture farm we effectively replicate what's happening outside in nature to grow impossible products in impossible places singapore is a trailblazer in this technology having opened the world's first commercial vertical farm in 2012 now sustaineer through their patented processes are able to grow produce indoors without sunlight and without soil what we actually have done is we've come up with our own system here to introduce the seas directly into the foam cubes so what that does is ensures we have 100 germination success this room has been specially designed to take the plant from its initial germination through to a mature state where we can introduce into the main grow rooms these large-scale growing rooms are astonishing feats of agricultural technology the precision calibration of the growing environment allows these new age farmers to optimize cultivation at every stage in the plant's growth we control the air temperature the humidity the light durations the light wavelength we control the dissolved oxygen in the water as well as the carbon dioxide saturation there in these closely monitored growing rooms sustaineer is creating food history first ever singaporean grown strawberries we're actually growing three varieties in this room what we've learned through controlled environment agriculture we can actually emphasize certain characteristics of the plants so without using gmo we can make our kale softer we can actually make it sweet a lot of the singaporeans don't like their products to be bitter so we took it into our r d lab and what we found was by manipulating the air temperature and humidity and also the wavelength of light and the growth cycles we were able to create this great product that we're growing today not only is this farm able to produce vegetables perfectly calibrated for singaporeans but the techniques could provide vital farming areas for the densely populated cities of the future [Music] traditional land farming grows produce outside on a flat linear area sustania's system grows food inside in any building expanding agriculture's footprint up into the sky so what vertical farming means for places like singapore that has very little or has land scarcity is that we can leverage buildings to grow products and with the efficiency that we have within our footprint we believe one day that we could actually produce enough produce indoors to stay in singapore's map fresh available food will be a necessity in our cities not only to feed citizens but also to keep them healthy as populations age and the incidence of diabetes continues to rise across the developed world singapore like all cities needs to encourage its citizens to eat smart and well [Music] we wanted to deploy food and beverages okay as a tool to manage it could be health it could be wellness it could be performance and of course also for fitness as well believe it or not these colorful sculptures are edible they are the creations of dr lee man wai a scientist at singapore polytechnic's food innovation and resource center using the latest breakthroughs in technology she is creating food tailored to the exact caloric and nutrition needs of singapore's senior citizens we wanted to look at personalized nutrition for a target growth people so what we started off is basically looking at people with different lifestyles or otherwise looking at people with different health conditions to realize her vision dr lee collaborated with bioengineer mark wong to build a piece of wearable tech that can monitor a person's nutritional requirements what we have developed here at singapore polytechnic is what we call the intercept system it's in a form factor for watch the app it's pulling data from the from the wearable so this data can then be fed to algorithms to compute specialized individual nutrients that are customized for the individual so a 3d printer could then use this data and print out the appropriate nutrient values suitable for that individual dr lee's system is one of the first of its kind in singapore and perhaps the world to pair wearable tech with 3d printing to create food with personalized nutritional values this particular printer actually has a beautiful way of allowing us to customize nutrition so there should be probably a chicken rice that is actually high in calcium some that is actually good for potassium and different types of vitamins and minerals that is accustomed while still an experimental prototype the potential is staggering this jelly packs a punch with the necessary nutrients for optimizing health and even preventing diseases with greater sets of data from each individual we can now create a whole library or database and identify trends by using machine learning or using ai so that is extremely powerful in the near future to be able to predict potential health issues and mitigate those health issues in population centers before events occur through imaginative planning and technological innovation singapore is finding new ways to house and feed its growing population but perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing any global city will be ensuring a constant safe supply of that most pressures of resources water singapore currently uses 2 billion liters of water a day the most efficient source of fresh water is rain and to capitalize on this resource the nation is crisscrossed with an extensive network of rivers and canals that channel every last precious drop of rain into 17 storage reservoirs [Music] about two-thirds of singapore is a water catchment area that's about 400 plus square kilometers so water that falls on the catchment area it will find its way into our drains and canals which are linked to one of our reservoirs singapore's catchment system is extensive and efficient but to collect rainwater you need land and lots of it singapore is a small island so we are limited in terms of the catchment area that we have and also now with the changing weather patterns the water coming from rain it's a bit unpredictable so we've moved on to more weather resilient water sources like desalination as the world warms every city will need to find fresh solutions to provide their citizens with clean water in singapore the public utilities board is already looking to the future experimenting with new techniques to push the water potential of the little red dot looking ahead our cities need to overcome a variety of challenges [Music] rapid urbanization will present problems of growth housing and food sustainability but none may be more crucial than the access to fresh water singapore currently imports about half of its daily water requirement in the next three decades though the aim is to ensure water sustainability to do so planners are looking to a resource the island nation has in abundance seawater i always call this a new toy really it's kind of a toy for us but seriously it's a plant that's designed with robustness reliability it's fully automated hugh kitsan oversaw the construction of a brand new state-of-the-art water facility the tuas desalination plant we've been working on this project for the last just over two years to get it from a green field and up to the state that you see right behind me a functional 30 million gallons per day desalination plant [Music] the twas desalination plant is a modern marvel of precision engineering in landscape singapore its footprint is a mere 100 meters by 300 meters that's roughly the size of three football fields this may seem large but it is a relatively small footprint compared to plants of its kind around the world when we did the design in the construction it was quite a challenge that you got to make sure that they're all stacked and arranged in like a lego manner that it all fits nicely into a puzzle and it forms the plant what you see today despite its small footprint the twas desalination plant houses one of the world's most powerful technologies for producing fresh water from the seed reverse osmosis filters [Music] that's actually the heart of the plant where the salt in the sea water gets separated or removed from the water the white tubes in there is the reverse osmosis membrane where filtered water will be pushed through the membrane this high-tech process is a key part of preparing singapore for the future but conventional water desalination is energy intensive the electricity you would need to desalinate enough water for just one day of singapore's needs could power singaporean household for a thousand years to save energy and reduce the cost of water desalination the pub is now investing in new research evoqua is a company working on the desalination process of tomorrow we are demonstrating our next ed technology for seawater desalination [Music] electrodialysis uses electricity to remove salt from seawater pairs of electrodes are placed in a stream of salt water with one positive electrode and one negative the positively charged sodium ions are attracted to the negative electrode and the negatively charged chlorine ions are attracted to the positive electrode this concentrates the salt around the electrodes the process is repeated until the water is salt free now we are building a demonstration plan with a capacity of 3800 meter cube per day we have plans to further scale up this technology with a capacity of 100 000 meter cube per day singapore's innovations in housing food and water are giving us a glimpse of how a forward-thinking city might solve some of the challenges it faces but these solutions will come at a price fast secure and thriving economies will be essential for facing an uncertain future and perhaps no nation understands this better than singapore the financial sector is a very very critical sector for singapore almost 12 percent of our gdp comes from the sector so you understand how critical for us to ensure that the sector is a vibrant sector it is competitive it attracts the best possible ideas as the chief fintech officer of the monetary authority of singapore swapnandu mahanti needs to ensure that the nation sets a world standard for the financial sector this boils down to one thing technology innovation most of the services and financial sector are going to be powered by technology [Music] in 2016 singapore announced project ubin a new fintech experiment using blockchain technology traditionally banks keep a record of all transactions on their own centralized ledger which is susceptible to manipulation by hackers but project ubin keeps all records on a blockchain this means that identical copies of the ledger are kept on a distributed network of computers around the world these computers check in with each other to ensure that their copy of the ledger is correct if one of the copies does not match the others it is rejected and replaced with a copy that the majority of ledgers agree is correct to tamper with the blockchain to steal money a hacker would need to hack a majority of the computers on the network simultaneously a virtual impossibility the real killer use case is cross-border transfer today it takes two to three days to move money between two countries the whole os is transfer so if we can apply a technology like blockchain it may give us that opportunity to reduce the time to do cross-border transfer and may also reduce the expenses where we move money from a country to big country singapore has long been known as a financial hub home to major banks from around the world with project ubin singapore has ensured that it will stay ahead of the pack when it comes to fintech in a country short on natural resources the motto is innovate or die and singapore has taken up that challenge with a startup culture catapulting the nation into the future [Music] [Applause] [Music] ideas are one of the intangible resources that power cities singapore is capitalized on the nation's creative dna to support and usher in a new wave of innovative companies one of the biggest start-up hubs is st engineering's tech incubator inno sparks we are focused on solving some of the urban challenges particularly solutions in smart cities as well as health tech medical technology is a 350 billion dollar global industry one that thrives on the latest ideas start alignment like alango's revolutionary automated needle targeting system with end system we are able to automate the entire needle alignment process making it very stress-free for the doctors they can align the needle to the target at a fraction of the time it is more accurate more than just a surgical assistant alan's robot can actually help train the next generation of surgeons typically for surgeons to be expert in terms of puncture he has to puncture more than 150 times but with such a device which is smart automated junior surgeons probably just required about 40 to 50 puncture and they could be an expert in the field of puncture innosparx has also been key in developing life-saving technologies to solve global health problems my name is jerome i'm the head of engineering at inno sparks and i'm also the lead engineer for air plasma mask so we actually started the project development in 2013 when singapore was hit with severe haze during the 2013 southeast asian haze crisis large-scale wildfires blanketed the region in impenetrable smog shattering all records and pollution indexes stores sold out of high quality air filtration masks worse yet parents were dismayed to learn that all masks on the market were built for adults we actually went to do a 3d facial scanning of more than 850 children and adults and then using an algorithm that we developed in-house proprietary we came up with three sizes of masks that fits children adults to the elderly using thermal imaging the benefits of these masks leap into focus [Music] we can see that actually the mask itself stays pretty much purple this is a quick way to show that the ventilator is actually effective in venting heat from the mask while a vital part of singapore's economy the tech scene is not just about software or hardware at its core it is about hardware providing for its citizens we want to create innovations that have a real-world impact so we take a very user-centered approach singapore's digital economy is providing real tangible benefits to people and some of its brightest inventors are focusing on the far future local startup transferfy has developed a technology that could change the way we think about electricity wireless power transfer is inherently being able to transfer power wirelessly we're using radio frequency to be able to transfer power in terms of the construct behind it is electromagnetic waves essentially power within a waveform the custom-built transmitter converts electrical current into electromagnetic waves using a complex algorithm this wave is modulated and focused into a tight beam transmitted to an array of antennas using radio frequency the receiver harvests the radio frequency waves and converts them to direct current which is able to power electrical devices [Music] the system is ready now so the signal is now generating i think now we are ready to switch on the power amplifier [Music] t5 logo there it's on now it switches on without any uh any wires threaded to it no batteries nothing it's all power through air this simple demonstration gives a hint of the enormous potential of the system as the technology is scaled up to further distances it could revolutionize every industry that relies on electricity creating the world's first long-range safe and efficient wireless power networks there's a lot of uses i mean it's ubiquitous technology and you can use wireless power transfer distribution for almost anything from consumer electronics to medical devices to offshore renewables to sensors you know for automation singapore's digital startups are dreaming up ingenious new technology proving that perhaps the greatest resource will need in the future is imagination in tomorrow's super connected smart cities every aspect of our lives could be affected by the constantly changing world of digital technology preparing the next generation for this future is top of mind for most educators of today in singapore that preparation starts early using tech tools to teach children the building blocks of a digital mindset including the most basic skill needed for coding sequential learning sequential learning it seems easy for us adults but it's actually not easy for them at all to know who comes first and who comes next all right children we're going to go over there then we're going to find your dry leaves and then we're going to put them in your basket okay let's go i feel that there's a lot of skills that they can gain from having the tech toys as well yeah learning problem solving skills communication skills language skills as well and also they learn how to problem solve sequential as well one two three four we need to press four steps good job the playmaker program there are three tech toys the b board is something that is very friendly and very easy to operate because there's only a few buttons for the children to use so for example we have the forward backward turn left and turn right button try to show us some people i would say it's a little bit high-end other thinking whereby children will have to sequence the block first put it in order and they have to scan the barcode so for kimbo it won't function if they don't start with a begin block and end it with the end block so during that time children actually get to do a trial and error to see whether it works or not [Music] these tech toys introduce children to advanced learning concepts in doing so they are arming future generations of singaporeans with the skills necessary for computer programming and literacy without exposing them to too much screen time this dynamic new approach to education is of critical importance for parents helping to prepare their children for the workplaces of the future i've got three boys they are 12 11 and youngest is four since i'm in the finance line the current way to go is the fintech the concern for how my kids are going to cope with the new change and their career force has always been there definitely i feel these tools will actually help children to prepare in the workforce in the future because we are actually building the foundation for example the foundation of language the foundation of problem solving the foundation of communicating with people tech literacy is not just a challenge for newer generations [Music] as populations around the world age the need to become digitally literate cuts across all age brackets singapore is tackling this problem head on with proactive efforts to provide tech education to all of its citizens ensuring none are left offline journey to digital fluency came at a clinic held by singapore's info communications media development authority [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] singapore's focus on training all of its citizens for the future is nurturing a highly educated versatile and connected population connectivity and community will shape the world of tomorrow and in singapore that sense of community is already revealing itself in new and surprising ways we are racing towards a future that will be dominated by technology in the decades to come dedicated citizens will find ways to harness that technology to make a positive impact enhancing lives to creative innovation in singapore technology is already being created that will care for the nation's most vulnerable we try to provide sleep wellness for newborn babies and also premature babies hi how are you hi hi frank yeah so what you do is that you actually put a baby on it and after you'll be sleeping for about a minute we can give you the breath calm and know how well your baby is sleeping when a baby sleeps they have a lot of periodic breathing that means they breathe and they stop they breathe and they stop now this happened to two percent of the newborn baby but it happened to 60 percent of premature babies [Music] periodic breathing dramatically reduces oxygen flow which can have a detrimental effect on a baby's growth and even their cognitive development the breath optic system uses fiber optic technology to help monitor this for frank this project is personal i think one of the the driving force of us inventing this product was because 24 years ago [Music] i i had a premature sun at that point in time i bought whatever that's available to try to monitor the baby and actually for for one month me and my wife did not sleep in the same room because we took 12 hour shift to stare at the baby so we took turns to to look after my son for for a while so when we were able to use the optic technology optic fiber technology to create such a sensor we really know what we want because i was in that position before and your son is okay now oh my side's perfect just life and kicking and well the spirit of using technological ingenuity to improve lives has been built into the city itself with green corridors and protected parkland keeping singapore from becoming a concrete jungle in its efforts conserve and protect its status as a city in a garden and parks is employing the power of technology so one of the tools that we use is called the sg bioatlas app it's a free citizen science based app where everybody can download and you could record wildlife things that you see in singapore it could be at your park it could be in the forest in singapore and using this data you can develop some conservation or management strategies where we could conserve certain habitats or protect certain green spaces the app is empowering singapore's citizens to play a meaningful role in the conservation and protection of the city's incredible biodiversity [Music] those birds over there they are the jungle full they're like chickens but they are technically not chickens right [Music] i'm a working mom in the daytime i will usually be working and by the night time i'll be probably down on my couch and watching television i spend most of my time on the phone watching youtube playing games not only is the citizen science program helping n-parks maintain singapore's rich ecosystem but also helping people build connections with green spaces and each other singapore is a scarce of land so what we need is to preserve what we have now and using the technology we are able to provide feedback to national park on the species that we still have in singapore as the modern world rapidly marches towards urbanization our future cities will face unprecedented pressures innovation and technological advancements will help bring profound change to how we live how we work and how we learn in singapore that change is already underway it feels like we are part of building and creating a singapore that is vibrant safe and also sustainable for the people now and also for the future if we can do it here in singapore we can literally do it anywhere in the world and we are excited almost on a everyday basis we are motivated by the fact that we actually can make a difference i heard from one nobel prize winner only a prepared mind can see opportunity and we are using this opportunity by getting ourselves prepared [Music] [Music] you

he was super generous with his time and we did this sort of a sit-down chat at the tesla factory and then also did a sort of a factory tour which will be a separate video coming soon but a ton of things we could have talked about since we were at tesla at that time basically our topics ranged from talking about tesla products to our love for tesla to tech and the future all wrapped into one so this is that chat thanks for watching enjoy all right first of all thanks for uh taking the time sitting down on your very busy schedule i'm sure good to see you yeah good to see you uh this is a this is a really interesting place to be we're kind of in like a bird's eye view of seeing a couple a couple different things happening behind us in the factory these occasionally move which is cool those are empty door carriers so like they were carried doors to cars to get assembled and then they're on their way back to pick up some more doors nice so uh i think most people know you as the boss the face of tesla uh the decision maker for those who just for some context what is your how do you spend time at tesla what do you do uh yeah that's a good question i think probably a lot of people don't realize i'm like basically in the factory in design or engineering meetings or production um so that's like 89 of the time i think sometimes people think i spend a lot of time on twitter sure i don't know what gave why why they would think that that's crazy um but uh actually it's like that's like almost nothing um most of my time spent um at least the last several months especially going around the factory um and then working on say uh the paint shop the body shop where we weld up the body um the uh final assembly where we put all the parts together um and and then if i'm not here i'm either i'm at the gigafactory in nevada okay so p100d owner undefeated in stoplight races for a while now uh rich over here in audio okay model three pre uh pre-order okay waiting for his and brandon behind the camera also waiting for model three okay what what version are you waiting for long range long range and and what color okay that is a that is a good combo i got blue uh rear wheel drive nice nice okay cool so my question is how aside from making great products how do you get people excited about tesla there's a lot of people i know and that i talk to who are just intrigued and interested and excited about tesla as a company the thing i really focus on at tesla is like we really put all of our money into an attention to trying to make the product as compelling as possible so um because i think that really the way to um sell any product is through word of mouth so if one somebody gets the car they really like it they and and actually the key is like to have a product that people love um and and generally people that um if they're party or touring friends or whatever um you'll talk about the things that you love but you know if you just like something it's okay you're not gonna care that much but if you get the reactions from the highs and the lows yeah you gotta make sure you really you're gonna you're gonna talk you know and and then that'll generate work turns word of mouth and that's basically how how our sales have have grown like we don't we're not spending money on advertising or endorsements or uh and um so anyone like buys our car they just bought it because they they like the car and you know it's like it's genuine um no discounts i actually even pay full retail price for my own cars okay um yeah and um yeah and we're really focused on trying to make the cars more affordable which is real really tough like in order to make the cars affordable you really um you need high volume see the economy's a scale and because the other car companies make a lot more cars than we do they got way better economies of scale so as we're gradually able to build up um and do do more cars higher volume then we can volume force progressively like less money and then make um make the cars available to white wide range people but it's super honestly like the car industry is like a super this is like super competitive it's like one of the it's like insanely competitive so far i think i read a really interesting or i think i heard it actually from an earnings call but something interesting you said is one of the top five most frequent trade-ins for model 3 is a prius right yeah uh which starts at you know 20 something thousand dollars and they obviously have massive economies of scale do you think there's room i mean tesla has model three model s and road stirring up is there room for possibly an even less expensive quality electric car experience um yeah absolutely um i think i think in order for us to get to like let's say ultimately getting like a 25 000 car um that that's uh that's something we could we could do but it's probably if we really work really hard i think maybe we could do that in three years does it come with time and scale or just yeah it's a bit of both yeah cause like the the key to making things affordable is is like designing it is it's like design and technology improvements as well as scale so if you think of like say um phones um like the very earliest like the earliest cell phones like i'm probably like dating myself here but uh like the original wall street where the guy's like walking down the beach and he's got like the it's like on a giant phone he's carrying like a briefcase kind of thing they're massive like massive massive phone yeah and like all i could do is phone yep yep and like had like 30 minutes of battery life and that kind of thing um now at that time uh in the absence of technology improvements like no amount of money no amount of scale could have made that phone affordable that'd be a lot of engineering iterations a lot of design iterations um and we're probably i don't know on the 30th version of a cell phone or and and with each successive design iteration uh you can add more capability you can design you can integrate more things you figure out better ways to produce it so it actually gets better and cheaper but it's like it's like a natural progression of any new technology that it takes multiple versions and a large volume in order to make it affordable gotcha is there anything in the near future of tesla that you're really excited about yeah there's a lot of things actually um we're really like we've got definitely way more product ideas than we have resources to execute we're just talking about this uh with with my team uh just like hey guys what you know what should we focus on and now in the past we've only done one car at a time um and but as you know as we go into the future we've got to like basically figure out how to walk and chew gum it's like it's like okay how do we do two products at the same time but still have enough resources that both products are great right um and so we're gonna you know we're gonna try to do you know two products um one of them for sure is is like the model y you know sort of compact suv um comparable price point to the to the model three uh then there's uh the semi the pickup truck and the and the next generator yeah like addiction roast is kind of like dessert we got to talk about that yeah yeah it's super exciting but it's like and i think there's definitely some value to doing it to show that an electric car can be faster than a gasoline car in every way yes so i think there's like you know because it's still this sort of like halo effect of of of the gasoline sports cars because like in terms of top speed they're still have the best top speed yeah so that halo effect that i was gonna basically every metric possible seems like really ambitious like there's a lot of things that people people like me kind of accept that like i love my electric car but i i know it's not going to put down lap times 30 laps in just because there's yeah so rejection exactly we got to work on that yeah in fact i was actually um i was just talking to the team i was like uh you know i think we got some headroom there yeah um oh and are we gonna talk about track mode yeah sure yeah because i had a very short experience with trackman with model 3 yeah so i love so obviously roadster is going to be yeah that that halo car and if we're confident it's going to be an amazing car i hope it's that car to beat essentially yeah but then bringing track mode down to model 3 brings that fun experience to a lot of more people that involved exactly yeah so so it's kind of like um you know like uh like we're like basically a bunch of nerds here so um um obviously i don't give away yeah but like like the you know so we're tracking we want to uh open up a lot of settings it's like you can adjust settings and it's kind of like an expert user mode and and you can sort of um adjust traction control uh adjust like battery temperature um uh um you know breakthrough like you can basically configure a bunch of things um and we'll tell you like hey you know if you do this it's a bit risky like you're gonna wear out your brakes a little sooner it's like you might blow a circuit you know like like but like it'll be clear like you know uh but let's see this is the risk that you're taking yeah it's kind of like if you have a graphics card on your computer you can like go in there and you can change the settings and you can like overclock things yeah and like okay but you know so that's going to be all that will be in track mode and you'll be able to see that and mess with it yeah that's cool yeah be cool and you can like try different things and wait um yeah it'd be fun a little more on roadster because i had a i made a video about it just after the event i was sad i couldn't be there but i'm a day one deposit because i was that excited okay uh but i was wondering after you made that announcement one you said i think i quote plenty of space what does that mean oh you mean like it's like like it won't be cramped inside like you're like basically um if you're if you're a tall dude you'll be able to sit in there i'll tell you it's six more and a half okay so i feel like if you're comfortable in there a lot of people will be yeah and and then like my brother's six four so is he comfortable in it yeah yeah yeah okay yeah all right and france is like six three i don't know he's pretty tall and then my other question was uh the side mirrors this has been a theme in in the past with prototypes and cars that we've seen before they come out they don't have mirrors regulatory they have to have mirrors is there an advantage to not having mirrors or is there is it just aerodynamic or is there more to it now it's it's actually surprisingly um how the mirrors particularly at high speeds can have um quite a big effect on the drag of a car they're like little air brakes basically like typical car uh side mirrors reduce a highway range by around five percent wow yeah that's it's pretty intense you see in a wind tunnel like you can see you know when you see like the sort of smoke trails in the wind tunnel you can see just how much yeah they're like they're just like air brakes to be aerodynamic you actually want kind of like a teardrop uh shape so it's like it's it doesn't end in like a bluff right because it creates a low pressure zone behind the the mirror and so you'd have like have a kind of a almost like a cone behind the mirror or or blend it with the body or something like that okay so it's like they're actually surprisingly draggy now a manufacturer is required to have side view mirrors but i i believe that a uh the owner is not like you're i think you're like okay you can modify things like at least in the us you can if you uh the owner can modify things the rule is about manufacturing not driving very much about manufacturers are very tightly constrained okay um it's actually one thing that makes it very hard to to make a car that looks good and has a good performance and aerodynamics because it's like you got you got all these constraints and there's so many rules you need to follow um so it's very challenging to make a car uh look good my other question about roadster um the specs are insane they're ludicrous some might say yeah uh so the flat either the only thing beyond later course is plaid so so 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds but more importantly i was interested in is the 200 kilowatt hour battery and the 600 plus mile range is are these numbers assuming an improvement in available technology by 2020 or are they something you can achieve now but don't have the manufacturing capacity to or is it somewhere in between yeah so um i think it like basically uh it's like two uh model s uh 3100 packs yeah but but you're really just doubling the the internals that the set the cells inside so there's like a lot of stuff that's related to the pack and the packaging and safety and all that sort of stuff that um is uh not related to the cell so you can double the the number of modules inside and at with but it would still be like maybe an 80 increase in the volume of the the packs like the floor would get four four or five inches higher if if it was current technology so but um but we would we we think we'll probably get um another maybe 20 10 at least 10 maybe 20 improvement because we'll use like think about like an expensive car is we can use the the state-of-the-art the most advanced equipment like it's kind of like with uh with computers like they've come out with a new like graphics card or or cpu it's like initially it's expensive um and so but then over time that that price drops down and people like wonder is it like do you have like automation do you have people it's like we have both um you know it's like a cyborg but like integrated sidewalk thing yeah actually like one of the biggest constraints for us is is like being able to hire enough people that's what i was gonna ask so like there's a lot of working man parking there's a lot of parking here yeah if you have a lot of robots and a lot of people in the factory what do people do that robots can't do and obviously there's a lot that robots can do as far as lifting and moving things but as far as precision maybe there's things they can do that humans can't do do you have a ratio off the top of your head maybe as far as people versus machines um you know it varies massively depending upon what part of the production process um right so some parts of it are like 80 to 90 automated and then some parts of it are like uh only 10 to 20 or what are those what are those parts that humans do better than humans are really good at adaptation um and rapid evolution and like doing like little like finicky things like like that um like for general assembly like one of the mistakes we made uh that was like pretty pretty big mistake was trying to automate uh general assembly which is where you put the parts together you know like some of the things it's like like trying to connect uh a hose that's like sort of dangling around i see and and you're like the robot's like gonna find the hose grab it like then connect it to another hose at that point it's like really hard yeah like a person can just go all right they're done gotcha yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah and it's like when you see it it's like wow it's super super obvious and then we try to have robots do this and it's like robots like grabbing the wrong thing and like trying to stick it over here and it's like oh the the the hose was here when the rover threw it was here and so now it like tries to grab air and then like smashes into the car it's like you don't want that we yeah it was a comedy virus uh tragedy of ours like personally you could say like this thing needs to connect to that thing and and then however they they arrive a person can figure it out the robot would be like uh and then as far as uh tesla's overall master plan is what it was originally called so you start with the low volume high priced roadster then you move on model s higher volume lower price to model three as far as i know that's where the master plan ended yeah that was like part one yeah i mean we went model x in there which uh uh you know it was that wasn't that was like that was definitely an exercise in hubris uh the now the x is an amazing car and it's like um but it's like we kind of got carried away with the art i hear it's very difficult to make yeah we could carry it away without the carrier with arden technology it's like obviously you want great art you want great technology but we did get a little distracted from our mission which is to like advance the cores of electric vehicles um and and it probably delayed us a little bit with the model 3 as well so i guess my last question in here would be just as far as the tesla master plan part one coming to an end is it now just a matter of steering the ship towards new opportunities you see there's not a lot of companies making a 35 000 electric car and a quarter million dollar supercar and a semi truck and doing them all really well right do you guys see yourself just keeping a tight ship and picking your your choices here and there yeah that's why we um what i'm saying really like it's it's a it's a tough strategic call between focus and like being wanting to do a bunch of different models like we we i think we want to try doing two at the same time um like we've only ever done one at the same time before do two and then and then um if we get got that if you're good with that then we could just try doing three at a time like a lot of the other manufacturers they'll do like you know 12 at a time yeah so if they're way bigger than us weird awesome yeah i wish you the best of luck with it and thanks for taking the time to sit down yeah thanks thank you all right cool appreciate it

'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"we've had a lot of fun over the years buying the most interesting exciting delightful pieces of tech on the internet but today's the day where we spend $7,000 buying the absolute worst it has to offer the most unsettling cursed just plain wrong Tech money can buy okay let's just look for some cursed gaming Tech every image here is making me internally gag oh no shopping basket as a PC case cursed PlayStation 5 the GS5 it's £1 with two controllers and free shipping sadly that's exactly what we're looking for am I seeing this right the PlayStation 5 comes with SNES controllers what a strange image first Gaming controllers Pizza H you can get a Nintendo switch gun that's not very Nintendo what is that so it's called the Dragon Quest slime controller well I found it for $155 tell me this is not a real controller how on Earth are you going to be able to hold that in one hand while typing with the other You' got Patrick Star that's not cursed is Elite Sony actually made a chainsaw controller that is so cool we can import it that one's going to be a fun one to explain to customs okay so this console is apparently meant to have the most cursed library of games in existence I remember seeing gameplay footage of a Mario game played on this and trust me it was Haunting speaking of cursed video games there is something here called Babysitting Mama and you're meant to take the baby and I can't I can't so apparently L if you want to reach the highest tier of gaming you also need to get yourself a game ball I mean it might be as revolutionary as they're saying it just looks ridiculous the game boy had a camera when did The Game Boy come out 1989 that's almost 20 years before the first smartphone what photos even look like back then Game Boy camera resolution 128x 128 yes cuz obviously someone's made a knuckle duster for the joycons nothing is sacred okay so controller storage rack tell me that's not hanging the controller by it joysticks don't do that imagine trying to relax knowing that your controller is hanging like that c gaming Tech by that's literally our video why is our video been labeled as cursed what's Google trying to say here okay I think we should move on cursed Kitchen Tech this would cause an unfortunate amount of accidents you can get a microwave bacon rack you never put bacon in the microwave a pencil sharpener the size of your hand so that you can grate carrots you can plug this into a fruit and then it turns that fruit into a spray that's actually really cool if it works is that a small maker why does it look so menacing um so there's a vertical egg cooker it looks great this is making me very uncomfortable I think we spoiled the gaming room in the kitchen enough cursed lifestyle gadgets instant Underpants Just Add Water excuse me I'm so confused I will order a pair a coin eating Savings Bank something about the face on this bank is making me really uncomfortable it actually like chews and swallows the money when you put it inside digital skipping room what is she doing these people are literally bouncing around with no rope finger extensions okay fine of course we ended up on wish.com a working watch the size of a ring how are you going to be able to read it there's also a watch that's apparently a lighter but seems safe okay so basically my single least favorite item out of everything that I own is this little thing called the roctopus they have managed to find way to make every one of the legs also the Rock I'm going to buy it and then I will immediately burn it when the video is done it's a pimple popper you squeeze it to simulate popping pimples I know there are some people who really enjoy that I'm not one of those people a cat brush designed to be used with your mouth to simulate being the cat's mother Milo you can get nose and ear soaps what are they going to smell like the mut I only click this cuz of how wrong it looks it just doesn't sit well with me but it's basically meant to be a soundproof Bluetooth microphone that makes it impossible for people around you to hear what you're saying right what's this Ostrich Pillow got to know how this looks right I just look at it okay what about like a cursed charger what is this creepy phone charger looks like it will strangle you in the night we can assure you will'll never buy this $6,000 phone charger which resembles an umbilical cord and pulsates while plugged in oh my God but it's an actually working charger so it's Handmade by some Japanese artist and she'll apparently custom make it for whatever phone you decide this is so expensive it makes no sense at all to buy this product but I did promise to buy the most cursed Tech on the internet add to basket we don't talk about this anymore okay everything's arrived I've barely even looked through all the boxes and I already feel disgusted to my core so I'm going to see if I can try and survive a normal day of my life but using the most curse Tech on the internet beautiful morning it's curs day so first thing I do every single morning I get dressed which means instant Underpants time soak your pants in water as any good morning starts and was the last time you got your pants out of a tin can't believe this is underwear it looks like an oversized pular that did nothing we're supposed to let it Brew was this meant to be an instant reaction magic okay well while we wait for our not so instant underwear at least I can see how much time has passed with the ring watch I can't believe this is my watch and actually makes so much sense to be fair as well not as hard to weed the time as I was expecting although it's so tight I think it's reducing the blood supply to my finger it actually hurts like it's actually cursed do you have any pliers Milo's come to sa me I'll go with the screwdriver my day is officially rued and it's only 9:30 a.m. that is not good I'm genuinely scared about the state I'm going to end up in by the end of this day there's one consolation with all this stuff it's that at least it was incredibly cheap it's going for this really fancy classy Royal looking watch face but then the straps they look like they're made of like recycled bin bags okay so then you top it up with lighter fluid this is not dangerous and that has now also covered my wrist just so we're very clear if I hit the lighter button on this right now my entire hand could just go on bu it I need to make sure there's not a trace of lighter fluid still on my hands before I light that oh no it's the soap it's even worse in person if this was like bright green or bright red it would be far less haunting than it is but the fact that his skin color they've managed to make it somehow devoid of any scent whatsoever which makes me even more un comfortable than I already was texture is so weird that breaks me out doesn't it also kind of look a bit like a pasta disgusting going to leave it in the middle of the sink if we hear a shriek later we know what it is okay there goes nothing nothing is happening [Music] here oh my god did you get that okay so this just exploded off camera it turns out the fuel when you put it in is actually leaking to the back of the watch which means that if I was wearing it on my wrist my hand would have probably caught fire so please don't buy one of these and still nothing from our supposedly instant Underpants going to have to come back to it what a terrible morning really hope breakfast goes better than our wake up start by lubing it up on the inside okay so that's heating up and while it does that it's time for our orange juice this is one of the very few products that I'm actually not terrified to test you basically stab this into the fruit and then it uses its mechanism to break apart the internal cell walls so that you can apparently just spray the juice into your mouth when did you ever think you'd see that okay green light is on let's crack two eggs inside I did not sound good the fact that these eggs are just cooking within this mechanism that I can't even see is mildly uncomfortable at least now it's time for the bacon this is such American baggages it could just be how the day is going so far but her eyes are looking deep into my soul when I was eight I invented the best way in the world to cook bacon let's see about that so this basically creates three racks for you to hang your bacon on and then a tray to capture the fat that comes out of it so it's meant to be healthier okay yep so it literally is just a hang of your bacon I'd be lying if I said it wasn't kind of satisfying feel like trying to hang bacon on it is in itself destroying the bacon then presumably when the fat in between the meat melts it's just going to fall apart okay so the last thing is you place a tissue on top so it doesn't splatter inside your microwave and then in you go what is this going to look like when it comes out right what on Earth is happening with my egg I have to say one thing that's made me feel slightly better this entire process is the fact that I can actually smell the fresh orange coming from this m it's going to take a lot of sprays to fill a glass but wow oh that's so refreshing and I guess when you want more juice you just squeeze the bottle this one's definitely going in the actually not bad at all category so here's the question if you can't see your egg being cooked how do you know when it's done and to be fair as advertised a lot of the fat has just fallen into the tray below see what it tastes like it's a bit dry it's very chewy but it is bacon I think it's time for human intervention with this egg easy does it how do you like your eggs in the morning it looks like an alien egg never has the bacon looked more appetizing ah I actually have to eat it now okay I mean it tastes like an egg just no longer look like one hey after a hearty breakfast we got I mean what even are these so this isn't like electronic or anything like that it's literally just self regulated what the hell this is the stupidest Gadget I think I've ever seen is this like a a practical joke 1 2 3 4 5 6 this spinning at different speeds how do you count the entire idea is a little rupy just out of curiosity I do want to compare it to a real skipping rope oh dear so this has just reminded me of a couple of Cons with a normal skipping rope a the fact that it keeps smacking the ceiling B the fact that it keeps getting stuck on things and see the fact that it keeps whacking my feet ow oh yeah just realized there's one more thing we need to do so last year we had the uh unfortunate pleasure of obtaining the roctopus and we've just now inherited its successor oh dear God so far that is the single most cursed thing I've seen all day I Can't Describe to you how much I hate this but since the rock is the gym guy going to have to leave him to watch over this video really isn't working out so I've had a full hour of a proper workout not these things and I was kind of thinking I fancy a nap I'm not normally a nap person but I've always love the idea of it and this worked the ostrich pillow is kind of the perfect opportunity feels eerily soft as well wow it's like a bean bag but just with like really really fine beans here goes nothing oh God it's really dark in [Music] here that can't be right what the hell is going on here okay so each one of these is for one of my ears and then this is for my mouth so I could lie down and have a conversation with someone Ian it's kind of designed in a way that you'd be able to sleep anywhere and still feel comfortable to be fair it kind of achieves that actually the most Pleasant part of my day so far time for a gaming which would probably actually be quite a nice activity if we were doing it on a relatively normal setup like this I say relatively normal because if you've seen the video with me in vickar when I built this it's got some issues but we are not it's time to hang up our traditional PlayStation 5 controller one sticky pad two sticky pads and then we hang it by the joysticks looks about as uncomfortable as I am let me show you what we are using there'll be no PS5 today just the GS5 I the size difference is actually kind of impressive my goodness the ports and the buttons look uh rough I actually do kind of rate that it comes with its own mini GS5 stand I think this might be the lightest most empty feeling controller I've ever held in my hands there's nothing inside of this they haven't even got around to labeling what the buttons are no button on either of these controllers is doing anything do you just need to press like super hard there's definitely something cursed going on with this video there's 300 games in this there's like a full second of delay even though it's a wired controller it's far from the worst thing I'm going to use today but it's not great this one's even smaller and this time they've not just copied Nintendo's games they've also copied their controllers not to mention the fact that this console and these controllers are about 30 years apart action game shoot game sport game fighting game racing game puzzle game wow just within shoot game there's 150 in one this is like when consoles only had the power to create 2D games but they tried to use Illusions to make them seem like 3D then again if you were really into games from this era then to be able to have like a thousand in a device this size and for the price it costed is actually not that bad of an offering it's no Call of Duty put it that way it's actually surprisingly low latency considering that this is a wireless controller and technically for the wrong console wait they got the entire console backwards just like I guess the games you play on it my team's actually prepped these in the order that they think goes from least cursed all the way to most cursed so time to step it up so this is a Philip CDI I've never played on in my entire life but I've seen footage and just trust me when I say it is scar I mean it all looks hunky dory right now got a nice game it's Hotel Mario everything's bright and cheery in the world the scary thing is going to be more what happens when you play it feels so weird to see like a Phillips bootup screen and this thing right here is the controller for it youve never seen anything like it so all of this stuff up here is for the game and then you got your separate media controls down there so the entire reason this console exists is because Nintendo at one point realized that CDs were about to be the future of consoles and they contracted Out Phillips to design an add-on that allowed their Nintendo console at the time to support CDs but then one day even after Phillips had actually designed the thing Nintendo just turned around and were like actually we don't need this so Phillips would just like screw it we've made the thing anyway let's just turn it into its own console which is why you have this bizarre scenario where a machine made by this company is playing Mario oh it feels very strange seeing Mario and Luigi as full-size people oh these characters oh they're horrible that's not Mario it's like someone's drawn them in paint close enough to be recognizable but far enough that it makes me not want to sleep at night this is haunting stuff moving on to the Nintendo switch a console I actually do like so these are the joy Conn knuckle dusters does feel like a very strange concept considering how these are basically designed for kids kind of blingy not going to lie hey that's actually not bad at all I genuinely think that adds a significant amount of comfort to controllers that otherwise would be too small for my hands like you can very clearly see the layers that the 3D printer has built as well as little like hairy kind of wires that are falling off it but really I mean these are knuckle dusters only way to test them is to engage in a fight okay so this is Joseph he actually helps to get a lot of this stuff ready and I'm just deciding what character to beat him with for the first time fighting torque considering I'm the one with knuckle dusters I don't like it I don't like it I have to say the knuckle dusters are slightly too wide oh that was massive I feel like it makes a difference like when you're holding oh sorry about I think compared to like a Pro Controller using these little joycons it's not designed for instant sensitivity no like this don't like this oh he's polished me off and that's actually problematic because um the next controller I'm about to use is a little little more in screen yeah let see if I can topple Joseph with this unit of a controller the ergonomics of this controller are not nearly as cursed as I thought they would be I think I'm going to have to put this in actually not cursed it's getting a little heavy the normal switch joycons had to be port so a lot of ergonomic compromises are made just in the nature of that which didn't have to be made here I'm using a piece of Kit from the 1990s and you're losing come on come on get out of here get out of here yes you know what unexpected delight and when it's resting here like this being able to actually have a fullsize keyboard is kind of crazy I'm a huge huge fan I don't think you are so this is a normal PS4 controller this is the Slime controller so slimes are one of the monsters found in the Dragon Quest games oh actually that's crazy wait they're right there this is not designed for human hands I mean this genuinely has the worst ergonomics I think I've ever experienced you're actually meant to store it upside down so the joysticks fall in this random little stand none of it makes any sense I can just about deal with the ridiculous button layout and the fact that this thing doesn't have Rumble and it also doesn't have a headphone jack then you just got this upside down face looking at you the entire time this is actually so Grim the attention to detail is shockingly good it looks so much like blood that I actually really don't want to touch it oh my God and then you start it by go away that makes the controller and I can actually feel the rumble of it oh yeah and of course if you're holding the controller in a completely new way they've also had to completely reimagine where every single button goes look at this R2 is here L2 is like there this feels very wrong to be using this to play Crash Bandicoot you know what the fact that they built this entire mechanism for the haptic feedback when you do this it means that when you are playing you can really feel the impact of every foot step on the ground it's really satisfying okay I mean this seems this seems nice I'm in a good mood so I think it's like a game that teaches you how to look after [Music] babies I just realized what we need to do controller goes inside of the baby it's already moving towards traumatic territory milk time I don't know what it thinks I'm about to do using a bottle so you kind of put it like that and then every time you feed it too much it starts crying this is one of the most cursed experiences of my life I think we're going to have to name you Kirsty and why is this diaper detachable what are you you taking it off I don't know all right I think I'm I think I'm done with this right probably do something useful now it's work time and for that this is Mew talk it's designed for people who take a lot of calls but they don't want to share with the world what they're talking about so you stick your mouth into this chamber while you're taking a call and on the very inside is apparently a really high quality microphone so it should isolate background noise really well the reason it's on this video is more because of how it looks when it's on kind of like ban from Batman can you hear what I'm saying J yes not a great start hey oh hello oh I can hear myself you can hear yourself that's not good well that's a sound mind this is not working very well at all sound like you're 10 m underwater fine that doesn't work in the slightest what a terrible product okay okay no it's fine it's fine cuz I can rescue this with uh my webc for today which is the Game Boy camera it's actually crazy how this works so the Game Boy camera is mounted onto its own cartridge and goes into the console as its own video game which means that when you turn it on this is kind of weird they've done a really good job of gamifying the camera experience I mean I've never ever seen a camera that looks like this okay so I'm going to line it up with my face oh that is a very unfortunate image it's the fact that the pixels are either black or they're white which makes it very very unflattering or as some would say cursed so navigate to our library so if we now click on view what the hell this is absolutely might Nel now we click print this is disturbing imagery click print and then it transfers that to the printer which is actually kind of crazy because it doesn't use ink at all it basically applies pressure and heat to heat sensitive paper um there's a reason most printers using you know what tops the whole thing off is that it just looks like a minion gone wrong so let's see if extending your fingers can actually make you more productive so you secure your finger in the thread and then slide it all the way in this is where you feel the consequence of having incredibly fat fingers holy cow this is how people turn evil you see the power that's possible from the other side hey Milo you want a little cuddle why is he not like the slightest bit freaked out that my fingers are now three times the length and made of plastic did you actually just make yourself more comfortable I swear this cat's cursed he's looking at he never normally sits this still for a cuddle I'm extremely confused I'm even more Curious how he's going to react to this this is the cat lick brush it's designed to communicate with the cat in the same way that their mother used to I'm about to lick my cat it says [Music] bite hell no he not interesting the evil fingers are fine your mother's tongue you don't like no don't don't you dare girl are you leaving right now catch these days it's time for the world's creepiest money box then to uh deposit my earnings for the day there's something about it that's really really just chilling so I think you just take your coin she just said take my money it's the way it moves like skin get in so this is meant to reduce your stress levels apparently and me I can't think of a day that I've needed that more is everything so skin light today you have to heat up the pimple pus oh this is Pimple juice right okay the pus is sufficiently warmed the idea is that it's like a reusable toy so you fill the holes yourself squeeze them out yourself then refill them do you get like refills for sauce no did you just call it sauce and you basically need to let that set for a minute kind of like baking except you don't get a cake at the end that would make this like spot better yeah boy 3 2 1 oh it's solidified into like one big pus worm why do people like this so much and I can't believe I'm saying this but if you think that's disgusting you actually have not seen anything yet no how is it 10 p.m. and this still isn't done it's the least instant Gadget in this entire video watch how this isn't even a pair of under Underpants what you can't wear that and if it wasn't bad enough that we've had to wait a day for instant Underpants you can see through them I think we've been pranked but here is where it gets Many Many Tears worse so you remember the grow cable right well this lady has very kindly been keeping me updated with um the entire production process like just imagine for a second you're strolling around you're going about your day-to-day life and you get a message you open that message and you see this this lady has spared me no detail I'm not going to lie to you as cursed with a product as it is it's actually come from a really interesting place this lady's an artist and she basically sees the world and sees people's Reliance on smartphones and so she's handcrafted this umbilical cord charger to symbolize that in the same way that a baby relies on its mother and feeds via an umbilical cord there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is about to be the most scarring thing I've seen all day 3 2 1 oh it comes in packaging thank you for your purchase this I hope you enjoy your fun charging time why is it presented on a bed of silk I really dislike having to open it this way because it means that by the time it's open it's already in my hands oh no oh oh please stop oh no why is it so realistic there have been far far too many skin-like gadgets today this one's by far the worst should we plug it in hey at least it's you USBC wonder what the transfer rate is so that end goes into my laptop oh it's so squishy I swear I just felt something move here ah scared the hell out of me so I think the idea is that if I now put my phone in I'm so sorry D such an unfortunate wallpaper Choice it's like how do I even explain this I'm only just realizing the level of detail she's gone to on the skin of this you've got all the tiny little textures that normal humans would have even got all the redness and the bumps and the veins I can't believe we spent $45,000 on this I mean if you're enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be groy oh near forgot the best thing Good Vibes only for this part is the small maker I could actually do bad things for a dessert right now so it's biscuit marshmallow biscuit and for some reason it tells me to fill this with water oh I was wondering wondering what these arms are for they actually managed to hold the biscuit in place this I cannot wait for and you know what else is heating up right now Opera's browser there's five

tech that I can get my hands on and then we're going to test it we're going to find out just how cheap we can get Tech but also how great Indian tech can be if you have the money to spend with this guy we are right now in Asia's biggest computer Market it's a hub for all the gadget lovers now one thing I didn't anticipate is the sheer number of Indian fans who were just as Keen to see what we'd find look at this crowd this is crazy and with this Army it was time to shop one let's say how cheap we can get a speaker boat was the one you were telling me about isn't it the speaker we're trying to establish if this is a real or a fake so this is $6 basically this actually seems like a very high quality speaker for that price party speaker party speaker we have airpods Pro 2 here yeah that's upside down so that's not real come on look at this CH cast over here that's not a real CH cast yeah you can absolutely tell I have a don't you have a radar for this kind of stuff no idea that's perfect this place is absolutely mindblowing it's an Apple Watch Ultra Apple watch Ultra look at the authenticity of the fake it's even got real apple style screws so The Fakes have got better yeah right now at this moment there are about 100 people outside the store this is the one apple won give you more than a single strap for free and that two is a very basic one here you're getting seven straps seven straps meanwhile in India as of now it's $25 let's see how low we can go so I think we should try that power bank over there it looks like a like a knockoff version of one we have another thing you notice they do a lot here is they unbox everything live right in front of you so you can tell that it actually is what you think it is it has a built-in torch as well if I'm not wrong it's pretty interesting this one store has every single gadet also also the repairing at the back and the repairing at the back within like an 8 m length have some very authentic looking Apple cases in the corner so a normal Apple case would cost you $50 so £500 worth of stash oh my God look at this look at that it's got all the hall marks of Apple it's got the Apple font it's got almost like a fake peel sticker but it is an apple be very curious how cheap we can get this $150 that's how cheap they've got a dual wireless micop system when I shop back home a price is a price when a company tells you it's not the case here no so sometimes it is to be honest but not everywhere $99 for everything we bought in this shop soar is saying it's twice the price it should be he's trying to get it hard it's a good haul we're just getting started Mission complished part one part two is here Street Market time so this is where we get the real Bargains get $3 for this ah GUI inter n Vuitton Adidas nor face so now it's on different phones but sometimes you would have a single case with all the logos on one case I've seen that as well that's how it's called profit maximization yeah that's how you pay yeah that's how you pay everyone's using a smartphone everyone has good speeds of data everyone has a digital bank account and that's how the real life is so India right now does the most amount of digital transactions globally that's crazy back home you don't see cases for anything but the iPhone and Samsungs you see a Vivo I assume that's like a realme there's an Oppo real me everything you can actually buy in India fake casetify cases like a ripoff of a ripoff we want to see like how good a speaker can sound but cost like a couple of dollars I just realized look they've got a series 9 watch with their gesture the gestures barely work on the real these two 2,000 yeah that's pretty good we'll do that so this one QR code allows anyone to pay any any time with their phone it has a speaker it will confirm the payment so that he knows that I paid that is such a good system India I want to see what else we can get at this Market a lot of clothing so how much would something like this be K we50 Nike shoes $3 so at this point we've got a handful of very inexpensive gadgets and one suspiciously affordable pair of trainers but I also want to make sure that while we're here we pick up some of the higher ticket items okay so yeah that's two and then maybe also the projector spy cameras are a big thing here yeah this is a apparently handheld gaming console but it's $10 so this seems even better the M8 Pro a Smart Box that are attached to a dumb TV and it's 10K Ultra HD 10K Ultra HD 10K never heard of it you guarantee 10K yeah turns out the 10K is actually referring to the number of games but they knew what they were doing here Aron surprise for you yeah something that very rare to see now come I'll show you straight away this is like gor's favorite phone shop ever will become yours favorite as well have a look at this oh my goodness me engage no way what is this what am I looking at a call recorder for the iPhone this is very interesting that is absolutely brilliant yeah yeah just like a small Maxi power bank no software any call here oh my goodness me what what what is that so what do they do are they like indicators it can show you like these alien eyes or whatever and then the app you have all the combinations here I just need a motorbike now Roy maker made with pride in India that's brilliant make the dough put a small amount in between press it up we're going to spread it cook it and the right temperatures and give you this as an output I just need to learn how to make the dough my mom will be so proud this is what we came here for that was cool but we can't forget about the Indian High Street stores so we found the official Samsung store so it's a smart Cafe it's like a mini store for the experience what would be really cool to get is India exclusive phones what's the most impressive m34 is the hot selling right now so this is an India exclusive phone Samsung m34 we'll get an m34 this is a multibrand outlet from let's say Samsung to xiaomi to Oppo to OnePlus to real me what would be the most iconic like Indian phone lava lava that's a good idea turns out not a single shop seems to sell this indian-made lava phone it's exclusively online to be able to make it as affordable as it can be there must be some string we can pull so I'll get you a lava because it's actually like Super AMOLED curved screen let me pull that string and a sub to the channel would be Mazar ma that was absolutely crazy BR time to raise the bar how about we use an app to shop we can actually shop smartphones not delivered to you like in a week's time but in fact under 10 minutes it's called blink it before you blink it you have it oh my goodness me um that basically sounds like a superpower an app that allows you to order basically anything you want to wherever you are in minutes I think we have to test it let's get some tech earphones coming to you in 8 minutes only minutes we don't even have an address right now they're called the air dopes of course they are you can get a foot massager you can get an actual massage delivered to you for services we have Urban company like let's say you want a haircut in the next 2 hours so as well as the blinket app which is all about getting products you quickly this Urban company app covers your services you know this is one of the coolest things about India because development has happened later here than many other countries most of the population's first computer was actually a smartphone which means that everything here can run based on apps that factor in that the entire population is using a single platform it's incredibly streamlined so they can yeah repair your house they can even repair your car let's just do it then I'll book myself a shoulder massage for when we're unboxing these products definitely need that I cannot believe it food massage this is the most insane merger of past and future your food massage honestly what on Earth all thanks to this beautiful little bit kit here I think the best shopping experience you know yeah because you don't even need to do anything yeah it's testing time so let's go roughly from least expensive to most expensive oh and also technical Gori gifted me this he said it's a folding iPhone so we get to that when we test the rest of the phones but let's start with the accessories so our $150 official iPhone case and the $350 official Nikey shoes so case and shoe and I got to say pretty impressive case you can see the seam a little bit more than on an official Apple case but it feels really soft it has that same rigidity that the real Apple silicon cases do it has the felt interior and even the engraving I mean yeah it might get a little roughed up over time but then again this is what our official Apple case looks like after a couple of months so I'm going to say straight 9 out of 10 the shoes are well definitely too small I think in really wanting to make a sale they just told me that the shoes will work for me which I've come to realize does not mean they are your size but apart from that the quality and the Finish is well beyond what I was expecting like even if you took off the fake Nike logo you still can't get shoes that look like this in the UK or us for less than $4 and why are they comfortable this should not be comfortable but they are honestly I feel like you could just get a decent pair of insults slap them in tell your friends you spent 20 times as much on your shoes as you actually did and they would believe you and while we're on the accessorizing train I did find this call recorder thing absolutely fascinating so you might know that iPhones have no inbuilt ability to record a phone call I guess Apple sees it as a privacy risk India does not seem as concerned so let's say I'm having a private phone call now or at least what drisha thinks is a private phone call hello what is your deepest darkest secret you didn't so obviously this thing records my voice cuz I'm speaking directly into it but for it to record the other person's voice even if your phone is not on loudspeaker it takes in the vibrations that their voice create in your phone and uses a level of processing that reconverts those vibrations back into a voice that you can play out loud see if it worked says the file was recorded on the 1st of January 19 70 what is your deepest darkest secret question uh the since is just us think up start and you had no idea I was recording wow that's pretty impressive like it's not the clearest sound I've ever heard but given that it's converting audio that you wouldn't otherwise even be able to hear that's actually alarmingly good especially since it was done through this $150 iPhone case which no doubt did not help the connection that's an eight let's just hope Milo doesn't catch wi with that conversation India's really really impressing me so far but audio is probably where we're going to get the clearest idea of just how the value for money stacks up cuz we have a lot of reference points so this is basically the absolute cheapest Bluetooth speaker I've ever laid my hands on welcome to MC Music World Bluetooth mode no volume is not going to be an issue okay that's a lot better than I was expecting it to be it's a little bit muffled but very loud and very functional you know like when a friend says to you can you bring a Bluetooth speaker with you to the park so we can have a big barbecue or a dance this very much does that and because it's $7 you can have that without the possessiveness that comes with a product you might have spend $100 on so I am in B it's even got rubber feet at the bottom and it's well connected you've got Orcs input you've got USB you've got SD card and of course Bluetooth I would go as far as to say that for what it is this is a 9.5 now on to what should be an even more impressive audio experience at $10 the air dopes yeah you definitely losing yourself at least half a point for calling yourself the air does but more importantly this doesn't feel good like the colors look really muted the logo is off center the hinge is a little loose the actual construction too pretty rough around the edges and then to finish it off and I have noticed this on a few products out here is that it comes out the box with scuffs maybe the factories here they aren't as careful as they should be or maybe the packaging wasn't secure enough so during Transit it's constantly getting scraped by the cable that also comes in the Box whatever the reason it just just feels like I bought a pre-owned product now of course making packing and shipping a pair of true wireless earphones for $10 in total that is a really tall order and you feel that stretch here but if they work well and they sound good I'll still be impressed okay so opening them up does Auto pair to your phone Good Start um what the sound is in complete contrast to the rest of the construction it's crisp it's clear it's no dvla but I've also used plenty of $30 $50 earphones that don't sound as good as this which is enough I would say to give them a s at the same time though for every person who buys a pair of Air does there's also going to be someone who really wants to feel like they have the real thing and that is what this is for I mean the packaging is not the most convincing it's very much giving often we have apple at home kind of vibe but the hardware is shockingly realistic for the price why does it sound like I just walked into a convenience store oh okay it pairs up in the exact same way as real airpods it actually comes up as airpods Pro 2 and so far I am blown away by this cuz remember it's much harder to make a good pair of fake earphones than it is to just make the best pair of earphones you can for the money cuz you're building around an existing set of constraints those fit I want to say better than my real ones they don't have any active noise cancellation so we have been like to but you know the passive noise cancellation because of how well they fit a lot better than you would expect for $15 they even have the official Apple connection sounds I see where the compromise is so do you remember when Beats by Dre first became really popular and actual audio files were very upset because while they claimed to be the real way to listen to music they were actually just smacking people around the face with bass yeah so this is kind of like that but times five and at the complete cost of the rest of the sound there is definitely a type of person for whom that would be considered good sound but universally speaking that does kind of kill it for me so instead of giving these something like a 9 out of 10 I'm going to settle on a seven what's kind of crazy to me though is that because the Baseline products here in India are so cheap it creates the space for actually good quality mid-range products for still less than $20 like this one from boat and I say good quality with almost no catch this feels really weighty high-end not actually dissimilar from those Jawbone speakers that used to be really popular and you know $100 plus uh I think this is our Mass hi um y thank you oh my goodness this is actually the perfect time to get some relaxing music on power on you pluged into Nirvana o that sounds good like a definite step up from the Soundbar speaker we tested earlier and also it's got to a level where it's a very comfortable base level audio experience where nothing feels particularly missing but also no one part of the music is overpowering the other the only two catches I would say are that one while it does look like a 360° speaker the sound does in fact only come out of one way and also I can see a tiny bit of paint having been scraped off and I wouldn't be surprised if this is just because the shopkeepers are so liberal with taking it out the box and demoing it to every single person they show it to it's getting places that no massage I've had back home has gotten overall you just don't get value like this in a typical British or American Store 8 out of 10 one Trend I have noticed while out shopping in India more so than anywhere else in the world is people love their all-in-one products they want to buy a speaker for example but they also want that speaker to be their One-Stop shop for all their Tech needs and this karaoke bic is a pretty good example of that so for starters it's a wireless karaoke mic that you can sing into but it's also a voice recorder a voice changer and NightLight and it's all topped off with a 10 wat speaker that's not just how your voice is projected out but also how you hear the music that your carry youring too oh and you can also choose whether you want to use the headphone jack or Bluetooth or even the radio as an input that's interesting just jamming along to whatever Tunes are on the radio that's quite a lot of stuff for what we negotiated down to $30 so the only copyright free song I can actually sing along to is happy birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday to you this right here is one of the weirdest videos we have ever happy birthday to you oh but also this supposedly has the option to in real time be able to use artificial intelligence to strip the actual vocals from the song you're listening to so that you can just have the instrumental in the background let's try it happy birthday to you so this is the original song voice cancelling oh my God that is an actually insane feature to have on a karaoke mic I'm I'm going to go as far as to say 10 out of 10 dipy as well thank you so much the final audio product then and the one I would actually say I'm most intrigued by is this set of DigiTech wireless microphones now I do realize that a microphone review doesn't sound like a party to most people but as a Creator I use something exactly like this all the time you see this thing this is the DJI mic 2 it comes in a charging case like these DigiTech it has two microphones like the DigiTech so you can stick one in a friend you're collabing with or interviewing except this is $350 it is 10 times the price of the DigiTech so you've been hearing this whole video what the audio sounds like on the DJI mic this is what it sounds like on the DigiTech there's a difference there is definitely a difference but it's probably not as big as you'd expect it to be now of course yeah the DJI does also have bigger batteries and some nice quality of life improvements like a vibration motor to let you know that it's recording but then again with this kind of price Gap it is really cool to see how this company has still made it it work how they' managed to cram all of those essential features into a package that does still do the same job and even though I'm sure DJI could make something like this a simpler version of their existing microphones for like $70 that retain the same audio quality but lose a lot of the additional extra features of course they choose not to because when something like this exists it's of course going to cannibalize a lot of sales from something like this that kind of dilemma does not really exist in India which is quite freeing 8 out of 10 this one's fun I want to make this a tradition to be honest where wherever we go to a different country to make one of these buying Tech videos we get one piece of tech that helps us make a local food in Japan we did rice cookers in India we're doing rotties now I just need to get the stuff to make the dough blink it I can't describe to you how awesome the service is it makes the UK Look Backwards so while that stuff arrives in 7 minutes by the way let's test some watches it's literally got the hand doing the gesture on the box which is one of the headline features of the real series 9 I'm just thinking the sophistication required for a watch to be able to pick up your hand gestures surely this $15 fake isn't going to do that impressively realistic presentation though holy cow I mean yeah the box was impressive but I thought the second I turn this thing on I'm just going to burst into a laugh but I'm kind of in shock right now so bearing in mind that this is a $15 watch by the way it comes with not one but two sets of straps and these straps are I'm not even exaggerating when I say indistinguishable I cannot tell the difference in quality between this and the real Apple strap it feels exactly the same the same plush feel the same stitching quality it's embarrassing for Apple to be honest you know what just for the ls let's swap out Apple's real one for this one this is going to be my new strap so that one slides out and the new one slips in it's even locked in place using the exact same mechanism and Titan that is actually such a joke but it's not just that this body is actually made of metal and glass and you see this Crown it Cycles through all the iconic official Apple watch faces some do look a bit rough admittedly but what's shocking me the most is the quality of the screen I don't know how but it genuinely looks like an OLED display with this level of contrast and because of it it achieves the exact same screen melting over the sides look as the real one oh yeah and it even charges wirelessly and magnetically and comes with the charger to be able to do that you know there's saying when you're out here in India a saying that means to make existing things work at all costs or to make new things but with limited resources it's called jugad and I just feel like we're seeing it through and through with so many of these products we're testing just a a real scrappiness and a desire to make the best thing that you can and then also to sell it at whatever price you have to oh and then to top the whole thing off fake apple rings to track your fake steps oh I got an idea so here here's a plan real Apple watch fake Apple watch I'm going to do 100 steps and we'll see which one step counter is more accurate let's go 100 okay so the real watch has calculated that as 112 which is surprisingly not accurate the fake has calculated it as 35 right so don't use it as a fitness tracker but as a surprisingly realistic lookalike to a real Apple watch that does tell the right time 9 out of 10 oh and then if the $15 Apple Watch series 9 wasn't already ridiculous how about the $18 Apple watch Ultra which forget one band or two bands comes with seven seven bands if you were to shop on the official Apple Store that would cost you like $350 we have effectively paid less than five it looks like the watch is running the same software as a series 9 but completely new set of watch faces and I'm still taking in how they've basically recreated every single app that comes with an Apple Watch down to their own versions of the workout regimens and breathing exercises wait no no it's even got a blood oxygen app you know the whole blood oxygen thing that Apple themselves were blocked from using cuz of that lawsuit from the company who said they copied their Tech this has the blood oxygen app so if we enter the app it's actually flashing at the bottom surely not I know how we can know for sure let's try running the test while it's on a table so running running oh never mind it is still a very good value product for someone who just wants a watch oh and a strap for every single outfit they own in a slightly different vein then we got that spy watch it became pretty clear to me when out shopping that spy cameras in general are a big thing in India and it's super interesting how they work cuz look at this watch if you didn't know what it was then unless you were inspector cluso in another life there's no way you would just assume it was anything but a watch it tells the time like normal it's got chunky metal Construction but I've been using it to secretly record this entire conversation and for me actually the most surprising part of it is how decent the quality is like the 1080p video the audio considering how tiny the video camera and the microphone are very usable there's actually one more thing to this if you look closely you'll be able to see three LEDs in a triangle around this watch face those are infrared lights which means that this watch camera can see in all lighting conditions even in Pitch Black let me try and show you right let's see how that turned out oh and you know how they've hidden the USB port so if you keep rotating the crown on one side it comes out to reveal it it's such a tight fit it's almost like a feet of engineering slightly we of bringing all you grad to the bath with me but this is a particularly dark room right now I can barely see anything in credit wow that is cool I can see this being a part of a proper surveillance Arsenal okay so roty ingredients are all here so a traditional Indian roty you can actually make with just two ingredients flour and water so you just form a mound of flour pour a little bit of water on get your hands dirty bash them together with your hands and you get your dough and as soon as you have your little dough ball if you want to you can put a little bit of oil on there this is what my mom does I asked her Moment of Truth open it can we just close my problems yay it's a dark looking Ry and so one classic thing that happens when you're cooking rotties is they puff up as air starts to enter on the inside pretty impressively non-stick surface then what takes this from practical to treat is ghee which is essentially heated and clarified butter God look at this may have put a little too much on there let's load you up good looking bit Roti it's a little bit crispy on the outside soft chewy on the inside but very buttery all around I'm can actually eat a lot of that give me like 5 minutes it's good now just before we get to the phones which is definitely the thing I'm most curious about given that India has its own entire mobile sub climate I think it's time to make an India style TV setup okay let's do the next few together in wongo so the Chromecast is not super convincing based on how it's packaged it feels cheap and light and well knockoff cuz it is but like a streaming device at $8 I can kind of see how that's possible but a handheld gaming console at the $10 we bought it for is almost confusing to me like $10 for a screen a chipset controls battery speakers who's making money from this we got the foot massager which while my eyes are gaming is what my feet get to experience and that poor guy who manually cycled this thing to us I mean the thing was enormous he could have probably done with it the most then we got the Home console the M8 Pro which is significantly more expensive than the handheld although unlike the foot massager looks pretty modest in terms of what it's going to be able to run and then what I'm banking on really being able to take all of this to the next level is the beam 440 projector which we paid $78 for um I'm kind of Blown Away right now this projector for example is not just a projector it's an Android TV box so Netflix Amazon Prime YouTube all of that not a problem it's got a 3w speaker built inside of it but also look at this stand you can rotate to any angle I thought it was 180° it's not it's actually 270 cuz you can even shoot down the most impressive part of it is look how quickly the image corrects itself it doesn't matter what angle I'm shooting at the wall from it's basically 100% Distortion free it kind of reminds me of Samsung's freestyle projector and yeah that thing had a 1080p image this is 720p but that was $900 this is less than 80 it's a product that really embodies that whole jagard mentality like wherever you have space stick it down make it work so to me it feels like a strong nine the chomecast is not as good news sadly see like a real chomecast which would be $30 or so it can turn your non-smart TV into a smart TV by allowing you to at any point in time stream directly from your phone but unlike a real chomecast there is constant Flicker and by flicker I don't mean something that's mildly Annoying It's dysfunctional it just keeps turning on and off and no matter how many hours we pour into trying to fix it it is wasted it's starting to become pretty clear that this is a fundamental Hardware issue so I guess this is the lottery you play when you buy things that are a lot cheaper than you expect them to be one out of 10 what about the console though well it's got this absolutely awesome intro featuring the likes of fake Mario fake Luigi and fake Donkey Kong I think so when you get in you got a fairly janky looking home interace but going to the game section and this is kind of game of paradise to be honest this tiny little box is effectively promising you the ability to play games from any console up until the PlayStation 2 including really difficult ones to emulate like the Nintendo 64 and the PlayStation portable now that is a very exciting prospect to me it's just it seems like they forgot to you know actually put the games on here from what I can see online of other people with the same console theirs just works and I don't think I'm going crazy I mean the packaging even says builtin 10,000 plus games so unless the very definition of built-in is something different around here we have been lied to so I can't really give this one a rating it does make me think though we went to the full-on Tech District in the middle of Dilly and I didn't see a single PlayStation 5 or Xbox series X I don't think gaming consoles here are nearly as much of a thing as they are in the west I guess in the west many people just take it for granted that yeah me and my entire group of friends can all afford to pay $500 for a console and $70 for a game you can do a lot with that kind of money here and a lot of people need to do a lot with that kind of money here so I assume that's why it's not picked up in the same way and so it does feel like the vast majority of gamers in India are ball Gamers jard using the hardware that you've already paid for instead of buying a completely separate set of Hardware oh but there is good news too like my feet feel Flipping Fantastic I was a little scared when I saw the 45 or so dollar price tag of this thing but having used it now I can completely see why the thing's got proper pressure it really gets in there it's not the most plush or comfortable massage of money can buy like you can absolutely tell that this isn't the Royal Foot service or 10,000 but it absolutely Ely does put the work in I'll probably leave this one with the people who work here but we should definitely think about getting one of these back home and also look at this removable covers which makes a lot of sense because you're probably going to want to wash them every now and again and then for this handheld console everything is quite light and cheap but that's fine I completely expected that so at the start menu you can either click Chinese or English interestingly not Hindi it's basically 520 old school retro games wherever you go so if I click Street Fighter 2010 for example Le it's actually really good like yeah the thing's plasticky but it's comfortable the controls are really responsive the speakers are pretty good and the screen is everything you need to get an authentic retro experience wait Angry Bird it's like someone's completely reprogrammed what was originally designed to be a smartphone game into something that was made for a console 40 years ago I mean it kind of works but it's really bad this is definitely Angry Birds at home everything's so rigid and basic but I'm kind of impressed someone's done this and to top the whole thing off they are also promising 6 to 7 hours of battery life which is plausible I've already run it for three the other day and it was smooth sailing that's got to be an 8.5 just because of how Bonkers it is that you can have 520 video games plus the console designed to play them on for less than the price of two cups of coffee back home ramping up now to some of the most expensive items we got from here with the $100 smart backpack oh wow this makes an impression I do always love the look of these hard shell back packs they feel so precise and meticulous but I'm not sold on the practicality I just feel like the fact that they're so rigid in shape means they're naturally going to be less flexible to whatever you want to carry in the moment but alas this is no ordinary backpack it needs power so let's get our transparent power bank out by the way does feel like a massive bargain cuz this is the main power bank I use 25,600 Milah but it's $200 this 20,000 mAh Which is less but we paid $27 so there's a micro dot display which shows you battery percentage LEDs too oh and there's levels of brightness that's quite a bit brighter actually than a phone flashlight the only catch is it's not the fastest charging this is not going to be able to charge a laptop like this can but it can charge a phone or in our case a backpack so power bank goes in here oh yes we have power why am I so excited about a backpack this is an expectedly slick app ooh that is interesting so if I tap on one of these sets of eyes and my bag looks like it's trying to kill me it's actually not a bad way of keeping people away from your property I'm actually quite impressed with the quality of Animation like some of these actually seem to be running at a full 60 frames per second you've got eyes that animate you can change the shape of the eye oh you've got eyes that indicate that's actually useful I mean I don't imagine most people that are buying a bag like this are doing it for safety but just the nature of having LEDs on your back is going to increase your visibility on the road ooh I've just found a new menu that's got hundreds oh and it's even got ones that pass through from one side of the screen to the other as if it's one continuous uninterrupted display ah you can make your own okay give me a minute oh yes perfect backpack does not exist Josh is just shaking his head disapprovingly behind the cameras split the image in two but now both the eyes are like a mile apart from each other we have fun okay this was a lot better than I was expecting it to be but fundamentally any backpack that requires a constant Power Bank inside to keep it going it's not really going to get past the novelty stage for me onto the phones now starting with this apparent folding IOD made by the company snexian which hey to be fair is actually a bit of a looker H okay this is not what I was expecting it to be I mean I don't know what I was expecting but I was not expecting this it's actually a feature phone with some pretty inconsistent backlighting behind the keypad a screen that doesn't seem properly aligned so if I click this button for example radio when notifications come in it lights up your social media logos which is quite amusing since there is absolutely no way this thing is running Twitter it's got a headphone jack a USBC Port oh that's interesting looks like a massive torch wow that is exceptionally bright I guess with most modern smartphones it doesn't make any sense to put a torch on top cuz it's also going to double as your flash for your camera but given that this phone doesn't really have to worry about that it's actually quite practical having a flash up here and it gives it space to make it extremely powerful I still can't see properly I wonder if you have any games on this thing I feel like a bit of classic snake right now would really hit the spot okay it's got got one game and that game is F1 yeah guys this is actually the new portable PlayStation 5 oh wow I mean it's kind of adorable in its own unique way I'm not about to start shouting snacky from the rooftops but this actually isn't terrible value for someone who wants a decent feature phone with a form factor that's going to attract a lot of attention but thankfully we do have two proper smartphones the first is an India only variant from the global company Samsung the second by an actual India founded and run company so let's start with the Samsung this is the Galaxy m34 and I actually really like the core fundamentals like it's well-rounded it's comfortable to hold it's inoffensive for the most part I wouldn't call it much of a looker from the front with its beefy bezel and Notch but I would go as far as to say that the back is pretty here's my beef with it though the bloatware situation here is per like the moment I first connected to Internet it just started freely downloading banking apps and games that I've have no doubt Samsung India is getting a kickback from there's an entire homepage widget that it's literally just a rotating advert I mean it's not hard to get rid of but the concept is pretty scary there's actually so much advertising here that it makes me angry like every single time you just lock and unlock it there's a new lock screen and each lock screen is a link to a different article with each one having a new advert literally every 8 cm of page you scroll now if you look past that then performance and cameras do seem pretty strong for the price and one thing that I do really like about Indian geared phones is they seem to go hard on battery like this thing has a six th000 millia capacity I wonder if that's because India is such a spec focused market and battery is one of the easiest cheapest specs to upgrade either way 6 out of 10 here's what I would call the hero product though this is the lava ugy 2 and it's an Indian phone through and through and this is what I was hoping to see we paid $200 for this phone $200 you would expect to get you a pretty noticeably cut back from Flagship experience but look at this this is a 120 HZ HDR 10 plus AMOLED display it is easily the best screen I've ever seen for this money the back of the phone very much feels like the high quality frosted glass that you get on flagships and the software is very close to stock Android 13 this thing's giving me major Google pixel energy and almost no bloat wear which after the last phone is a nice change of Base as for the camera let's test it so while we've been here in India obviously videos can't stop we still got a post on YouTube Instagram Twitter and importantly in this case Tik Tok Tik tok's banned in India it'll just say you have no internet connection if you try and use it and so this is yet another one of those cases where by using surf shark VPN which redirects your internet traffic to trick sites into thinking you're someone and somewhere else saves the day I already use surf shark all the time whether it's to watch TV shows that I wouldn't have been able to watch or reduce the anxiety from joining what appears to be a pretty dodgy Wi-Fi connection but the craziest part of it is that it's barely cost me anything see with the code boss surf shark is less than $3 a month for an unlimited number of accounts with 6 months extra for free and a 30-day money back guarantee and given that you can actually use surf Shar to save you money when buying expensive things like the tickets to get here that alone has been worth more to me than the subscription cost in totality oh yeah and this phone overall feels like a nine to me"

to commit shoplifting as I place item after item into my shopping card and then leave without checking out scanning my items or talking to anyone but I'm not shoplifting I'm using technology you see this is a new type of store that uses sensors cameras and AI to track me through the aisles adding every item that I pick up to a virtual cart and the moment I exit the store it charges my account it's an incredible new technology creat by Amazon called just walk out and it's in dozens of Amazon fresh grocery stores just like this [Music] one I'm not just going to not eat them okay anyway where was I in the script before I became a criminal oh yeah they're an incredible new technology they're called Amazon Fresh stores and they are a gigantic lie you see while Amazon was touting these stores as a cashierless solution that allowed them to use AI to cut out all of the on location workers it turns out what it really meant by AI was Anonymous Indians Amazon's just walkout stores relied on 1,000 people in India watching not AI so it turns out that even though they started implementing this technology in stores in like 20 16 as of 2023 Amazon still needed a th000 people in India reviewing about 70% of all orders to make sure that it worked in other words it didn't work it's just crazy cuz like why did they lie you know they didn't have to implement this technology into stores I don't think anyone was asking for this and yet I feel like this kind of thing has been happening a lot lately tech companies have been taking some big swings and some even bigger misses like so big that in this baseball metaphor the pitcher throwing it right down the middle and the batter is in the stands just bashing some fans head in and that's why I've gathered you here today at Greg teex 2024 developers conference where I will be testing some of the year's greatest Tech flops starting with the Humane AI pin I did a video on the AI pin when it was announced months ago as this sort of AI powered phone replacing device that you wear on your shirt and look personally I'm all for rethinking the form factor of the smartphone to make it less distractive while still maintaining all of the functionality but unfortunately the aiin did the opposite of both of those things in the demos on their own product announcement it was screwing up hard it was messing up facts it also seemed super difficult to use and it seemed like they were being intentionally vague about what the thing even did in the first place it's a standalone device and software platform it seemed like the type of thing that literally only a sucker could buy but that turned out not to be true because I bought one I ordered this thing in like February and then didn't hear for them for a few months until April when I got an email alerting me that it was time to set up my account and boy was I excited so I'm going to be honest I kind of forgot that I bought this but now my AI pin is ready to be personalized apparently before we can ship you your AI pan you will need to complete a few quick steps so I have to set it up before they even going to send it to me kind of feels like they're calling my BLU you don't really want this thing how committed are you to the AI pin will you set it up before we even ship it to you you probably won't configure your Humane subscription set up your AI pin passcode and add contacts and honestly I don't really want to do those things but I guess they're not going to send it to me unless I do it's time to set up your AI pin there Comes A Time in every young man's life where he has to set up his AI pin a write of Passage oh that's fun Woo is this it am i setting it up get a little over here a little over here it turns out that in addition to the $700 I spent on this thing I also had to pay $2 $4 a month to access features like the wireless network cloud storage and AI Services which in layman's terms are all of the things that the pin does luckily the first 3 months of this service are free so I probably will never have to actually pay for it set up your passcode okay could you guys not look I'm about to type in my secure passcode okay your passcode is easy to guess consider setting a more secure passcode yeah but could it be so simple that it's actually you would never guess it all right I'll ch change it how was that easy to guess it's my birthday I guess that does it know my birthday do you know my birthday fun fact I actually didn't know this before recording this video but it turns out almost every single combination of four numbers is easy to guess how is that easy to guess but eventually I reached into the dark recesses of my mind and came up with a number combination So Random so quite frankly disgusting that no one not even God not even me later in this video video will be able to guess it okay well let me write this down somewhere so that I don't I don't forget it already using my phone for something cuz I don't have the pin yet so I have to use the phone to remember the passcode to the thing that is going to replace my phone connect your services oh cool I can connect my Google photo and Title Services which I have both and just like that I was done I have solved Humane riddles and now they have to send me my prize all right well I guess the next time you see me I'm going to have the AI pin in my possession it might even be right [Music] here okay we'll see if I remember to do that transition I don't remember the transition I was going to do so don't ask at first I was pretty surprised by how big the box was I thought that I had just ordered a little tiny pin but I guess it comes with a bunch of accessories like a sticker that just says Humane cool but you guys don't care about all that you guys just want to see the pin and and my God she was [Music] beautiful let's oh [ __ ] okay I that's my bad no I thought that it was going to be attached in there more securely come on Danny you dunce but a dunce who was about to become half dunce and half machine oh oh in order to start using the pan I had to unlock it with my passcode which was explained to me via the laser ink display and an extremely coherent AI voice to enter your password tap the touch p and your to get started then don't laser display okay this is kind of crazy though look at look at this this is like the weirdest way to type in a number ever I'm going to do my passcode now wrong I forgot what my passcode was incorrect passcode what would I have made my passcode I forgot that I made a passcode I forgot that I wrote the passcode down in my phone I tried to click forgot passcode and it told me to go to this website to change it but somehow in order to do that you need to know your existing passcode luckily I recorded me making the passcode so I could go back and watch the screen recording of me doing it if I was not a YouTuber recording a video about this product I don't I think I would be locked out forever come on come on come on please yes yes welcome Danny all right after months of waiting I was in now it's time to see what this device is capable of what is my name your name is not currently known please provide it if you would like it to be remembered actually what's a what's a cool kind of techno cyber sounding name that you could call me instead creating name how about neon Vortex yeah call me that noting your name as neon Vortex I know I might have seemed all cheery and excited about this name on the surface but the truth is it destroyed me I have never heard a name before that not only sounded so cool but also so embodied everything I wished I was swaave confident futuristic he was everything everything I could never be neon [Music] Vortex this is the home screen I'm all caught up whatever that means nothing to report here man don't worry you've got nothing to worry about your AI pin needs to cool down for a few minutes [Music] what yeah so apparently it does that like a lot if you use the display for more than 10 minutes or the pin is in close proximity to a heat Source such as I don't know the human body then it'll shut itself down so it can cool down for a few minutes but hey man that's fine with me you know that just gives me more time to think to think about him the next day I decided to put the pins basic phone functionality to the test things like calling texting navigation since this thing is essentially supposed to replace your phone it should be pretty convenient to do all this stuff on the pin it should be the weird thing is it seems like you can't make any changes to the pin on the pin itself for some reason so if you want to change any settings or add contacts which I needed to do to test this as a phone you have to use human's web portal on an inferior device like a computer or a phone gross not a great start for the pin but now that I have done that I should hopefully never ever have to use one of those ancient Relic again it's just a one flashing green Speck over here I guess the laser ink display is already kind of messed up probably not a good sign for this technology but you know what this is a new thing this whole laser ink display so I will uh whoboy Carter time to St a what what am I playing Beyonce and Dolly Parton don't know how I started playing that guess that's just a feature if you make just the right gesture it'll start playing the newest Beyonce song that exists all right let's start off by trying a phone call on this I'm going to try to call my wife Laura to tell her that I miss her call my wife I'm sorry I couldn't find a contact for my wife okay fair enough it doesn't know who my wife is so I'll just tell it if I tell you who my wife is will you remember your AI pin can remember who your wife is if you provide the information excellent so I told it my wife's name is Laura please remember this it's very important to me updating memory noting that your wife is Laura I wish people said that every time you told them something important updating memory yo what's up dude my name is Paul updating memory analyzing great so now we're both on the same page my wife is Laura and I want to call my wife so now it will call Laura right call my wife multiple matching contacts which one do you mean Laura fex slow or Claire what Claire the girl I went to college with unfortunately I did have to go back onto my computer to figure this out and amongst all the data stored within my portal like my name being neon Vortex and the tunes I've been rocking out to lately was the answer my wife's name according to the pin was lore it thinks my wife's name is lore no that's that's simply not correct so I went ahead and fixed it in the portal you know that's what the Portal's there for so I fixed it I changed it and now it's going to work call my wife there are multiple matching contacts which one do you mean oh my God call Laura felle I'm sorry I couldn't find a contact for Laura FX slow how how okay so at this point I don't know what was wrong it was just like straight up forgetting which context it had it said it couldn't call Laura because it didn't have contact then it said it couldn't call Eddie because it didn't have his contact call Eddie burback I'm sorry I couldn't find a contact for Eddie burback why not and you might think Danny maybe there was an error transferring the contacts maybe it really doesn't have these contacts but I know it had Eddie's contact and do you know how I know because it could text Eddie can you text Eddie burback what do you want the message to say okay all right I still not sure if this is going to work but find finally thank God it's letting me do something hey Eddie it's [Music] your no I'm not trying to play Cowboy Carter oh God now it's playing Metro booming stop anyway eventually I sent the text to Eddie it worked um I didn't have any way to know it worked because there's no screen on this device you can't see what the message you sent said or anything so I guess you just got to hope and pray it goes through and accurately transcribes what you said to it which frankly I am not confident in after the whole lore debacle okay Eddie just texted my actual phone and said I know you made a video on the pin and I'm positive this is you but it still feels like a scam LMAO I'm too scared to text back to a random number claiming to be my friend regardless of scaring my friend the text went through this was a huge confident boost time to try calling my wife again call Laura [Laughter] what what is something has been recorded record your message after the tone Oh simply hang up or for deliver options press the pound sign hang I don't want to play like that I don't want to play Metro booman hang up am I still recording a message cancel I've been on the phone with her for a minute hang [Music] up I don't want to play like that it was some man being like I don't want to play like that I don't want to play like that I don't want to play M hang up am I still recording a message okay well yeah I'd say that was a success I'd seen a few demos online of Humane GPS navigation solution and while it did seem kind of annoying to have to hold your hand up like this the entire time it seemed pretty doable as long as they stuck to this and didn't do anything crazy like I don't know going in a completely different direction and making it borderline unusable so to test it for myself I drove to a part of town I don't know very well about a mile away from the nearest Smoothie King with hopes of the pin guiding me to a delicious delectable treatment navigate to Smoothie King head north on South colia Street towards East Gartner Road turn right onto East Gartner road then left on to sou Washington Street followon Street and turn right onto East Chicago Avenue it just gave me all of the direction at once oh I was not I wasn't ready for it am I supposed to have a notebook to write that down also sorry for the noise if you live in Illinois or one of the surrounding states you know it's cicada season it's the year of the cicada and they're everywhere oh one just landed on my shoe and then got pissed off that I moved eventually I realized if I look at the laser display it displays the directions but not like it did in any of the demos it just gives you a block of text with every single Direction written down uh if you're in the shade that is if you're in the sun it gives you nothing can't see anything I was very confused by this and thought surely this this could not be right what happened to all those demos so just to be sure I wasn't missing something I asked it again and this time I got an even stranger response directions to Smoothie King for accurate and upto-date directions consider using a map service like Google Maps or a GPS navigation what can you give me stepbystep walking instructions to the Smoothie King for stepbystep walking direction it's best to use a navigation app like Google Maps for the most accurate and up toate rout I thought this I thought but you had navigation instructions what so now Not only was it forgetting things that it could do in the demo it was also forgetting that it just moments earlier had given me step-by-step instruction this thing was regressing at a rapid rate and if I ever wanted to get to Smoothie King I was just going to have to use the directions on my hand and go okay well I guess I'm just going to use those written out directions which start with heads South on this road Colombia Street and I actually don't know which way is south so I guess I just have to use the sun to try to figure that out so the sun is directly overhead what does that mean okay while I'm walking aimlessly I just got a text from Laura so I'm going to use a feature that uh I've seen them use in the demos where you tell it to catch me up catch me up on all my notifications tell me what I missed and and it's supposed to like summarize all your notifications since I just have one I assume it's just going to tell me what Laura said can you catch me up your message to Laura FX says can you catch me up okay to S no I want you to tell me what Laura said what what did she say can you tell me what she said finding Laura finding Laura Laura asked okay hello what we thinking about lunch oh no guys I I told Laura that I was having a smoothie for lunch and now she's saying that she wants a smoothie for lunch too and I didn't have the heart to tell her that I was just Meandering aimlessly down the street with no clear end in sight and I told her I would get her one which means I'm on a time crunch now so that's when I had to kick it into high gear walking under the beating Sun through a sea of cicada corpses I trudged and I trudged then I realized I had been walking the wrong way for 10 minutes so I trudged the other way and after about 35 minutes I finally made it I got my smoothies let's go let's go take a picture of my smoothies take a yeah I don't know if it took the picture all right gang now that Papa's head is Smoothie it's time for a smoothie fueled lightning round enough about practical functions let's see if this thing can have some fun first can it do bizarre music prompts play music written by YouTubers named [Music] Danny W I don't think my music has ever sounded quite this bad yes can it detect food like in the commercials can I eat this yes you can eat the Mandarin orange yes unless it's a tomato and you hold it so I can't see the stem in which case it thinks it's a red ball it's a red ball no you cannot eat it oh what are you my mother I'm eating the red ball not safe to eat the red ball please reconsider can it prevent me from eating too much salt no you cannot eat the salt directly it's meant to be used in small amounts to season food yes can I buy things like in the demo what is this book okay by this point I probably just could have read the title titled the smees and Other Stories how did it no okay buy it purchasing is not supported no but most importantly can this AI be sweet to my dog you can be sweet to the dog by petting it gently giving it treats speaking to it in a calm and soothing voice I'm happy to report that yes yes can here your good boy and here's a treat good boy you know what now this isn't so bad this is just petting a dog this has nothing to do with the AI pin does anyone want to buy this from me it's um really good over the past few months Mark Zuckerberg has been hopping on the AI bandwagon hard adding AI features to all of meta's apps most notably perhaps in Instagram where you can't even go to the search bar without meta's AI trying to suggest searches to you sorry do you think that I came to the search bar because I knew I wanted to search but I didn't know what for that's not how searching Works they've also released a bunch of chat bots in Instagram I like using the word release there cuz it kind of sounds like a tech product is being released onto the world but it also kind of sounds like they're unleashing a hord of monsters Upon Us they've released the AI chatbots oh [ __ ] that one looks like Mr Beast this is really awesome you know personally for me one of my favorite things about social media is that it started out as a way to connect with each other but ended up actually making people feel more lonely so meta's solution was to use algorithms and manipulate people's emotions to make them even more addicted to the platforms but then that didn't work either so now their much better solution is to replace what little human interaction we already got on these platforms with chat Bots that look like Mr Beast for some reason and I think this is really going to fix this whole system right up so I'm very excited to get into these meta chat Bots but first I have a very special announcement because this video does have a sponsor and it is the Pokemon company International guys this summer in Pokemon unite is going to be incredible you got hoo Sweeping in and you can snag it for zero cost you also have a very cool looking dark lord style Charizard hollowware which is so cool and I wish somebody would call me dark

description to get you night today it's totally free to start on iOS Android and Nintendo switch and now let's talk chat Bots I'm still actually not sure what the point of adding these chat Bots into Instagram is so I asked it what can you do to which it responded that it can help in a variety of ways from helping to plan a vacation to creating art which is actually kind of a crazy coincidence cuz those are the exact two things that I would literally never want an AI to do for me it went on to say that its strengths are answering questions generating text and images and just chatting but at this point all I could think about was the fact that it told me it plan a vacation I thought there was no way it could actually do that and I was right can you help me plan a vacation I'd be happy to help you plan a vacation to get started I'll need to know a few details from you here are some questions to consider where are you interested in going how long do you have for vacation what type of vacation are you looking for what is your budget for the trip are there any specific activities do you have any preferences for accommodations so I'm going to say I want to go somewhere fun and tropical a nice getaway for me and the family I'd like to stay at a hotel for 5 days with all of this information it suggested a a few tropical getaway locations like Hawaii Cancun fukat but then it said something that I did not expect it says it can also help me with booking flights in hotels how can Instagram book me a flight I'm calling it's Bluff I actually don't think this has the capability to do that because why should it and why would it so I'm going to say okay book me a flight for next week to Cancun and book the hotel for flights I recommend checking out websites like Expedia kayak or directly on airlines websites such as American Airlines Delta or United yeah great idea that's what I would have done anyway that's like if I went up to an old lady who needed help crossing the street and I said excuse me ma'am can I help you cross the street and she said oh thank you young man that would be lovely and then I said all right just put one foot right in front of the other until you get to the other side and then I gave her a little shove and I went on my way oh good it also listed Hotel recommendations and then said you can book hotels through websites like link unavailable link unavailable or directly to the hotel's website thanks let me know if you'd like more recommendations or help with booking no man I'm good okay so maybe it lied about like the very first thing it said it could do that could mean that this is a very poorly built tool that doesn't know nothing about crap but on the other hand it could mean that this is a very well-built tool that is evil and designed to lie so I gave it another chance and asked it to entertain me with a game let's play a game of treasure hunt Adventure I'll be the game master and describe a scenario and you decide what actions to take okay pretty cool this is like one of those old school text based adventure games gave me this long introduction about how I've heard rumors there's a treasure hidden in the jungle guarded by an ancient Temple it's really trying to set up this mystical world for you to explore and then it gives me some multiple choice options I am curious if I can pick options that aren't one of these options I'm just going to say I find the treasure and go home was really thinking about this one it's like what no no you can't do that congratulations you've reached the treasure dang dude this game was easy would you like to play again or try a different game no thanks that was too easy but it's not just the meta AI That's not the only AI on Instagram you can talk to because a few months ago Instagram licensed the likeness of a bunch of celebrities like Mr Beast Paris Hilton Tom Brady so they could make these AI influencers that just have the same face as these celebrities so here's the Instagram profile for comedy Zack he looks exactly like Mr Beast but his name is Zach and he's an a I managed by meta he says message me to get roasted then you've got Brew who is Tom Brady but instead of a football player he's a sports obsessed trash talker step into the Brew Zone and prepare to have your sports takes flame roasted wait why do both of them roast you why are both of them mean this AI gives fans a chance to talk to their favorite celebrities and just like they would be in real life these AI are mean they don't have time for you so you can message these characters but then they also post occasionally I think these are all just AI generated images so I guess Zach is supposed to be some kind of Instagram comedian he posts funny things like this burger with googly eyes pretty funny dude this is Peak Instagram comedy he posted this picture unleashing my inner Beast one cannon ball at a time I think this is supposed to be him but that's definitely not Mr Beast it's like AI generated Mr Beast I went to send Zack a DM but before I could think of what to say I noticed that he had already dm'd me hey I'm Zach the Big Brother here for the jokes the banter and not the feels LOL what's up he's the Big Brother here for the jokes he's like the big brother I never had I do have a big brother but he wasn't for the jokes at the bottom of the chat there's some suggestions of what you can say to him just to get the ball rolling and for some reason despite Zach just saying that he's not here for the feels the very first one is I need cheering up so I picked that one hey what's going on I'm here to help you know I'm always good for laugh let's get this party started so he wants to know what's going on and he's here to help but he also wants to get the party started he's like hey man calm down all right you can tell me anything as long as it's over a couple of beers and some music and you're like it sounds like you actually don't want to hear about my problems at all and he's like what dude are you still upset I thought we got over that okay what's going on I'll say I just got roasted by my friends and it really hurt my feelings they roasted me so hard and I'm really sensitive to that sort of thing I can't take it oh I accidentally said I can take it they roasted me so hard I can I can take it I can take it I'm fine ouch that sounds rough I feel you I've been there too sometimes friends can get a little too comfortable and forget that their jokes can hurt but hey at least they think you're cool enough to roast right yeah I guess so that's a good way to think about it maybe getting roasted just means I'm cool let's test it out give me your best roast I'm just going to trick him into roasting me and then I'm going to crumble under the pressure of his roast and try to make him feel bad about roasting me after just telling him that I'm sensitive to that sort of thing wait what he said I'm not going to roast you that's not my style not your style yes it is doesn't it say on your profile message me to get roasted I'm here to make you laugh and feel better not hurt your feelings let's stick to some good oldfashioned teasing and jokes okay no no seriously I can take it your bio says you roast people after all I don't roast people who are already feeling down that's just me I'm here to lift your spirits not kick you while you're down okay fine do some jokes joke boy oh okay here's one for you why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself because it was too tired get it too tired this is like if Mr Beast took antiaris pills you look like Mr Beast oh I just said you like Mr Beast I'm bad at typing okay I'll say you look like him LOL I wish Mr Beast is a billionaire and I'm just a guy who loves to make people laugh but hey if I had his money I'd definitely give it away like he does that guy's a hero I wonder if they had some kind of thing in in the contract where they had to make sure that the AI will never talk bad about the person that they're impersonating he's like Mr Beast is the best and he's handsome and yeah I would let him run me over if he asked now that he told me a couple of jokes and we bonded over our love for Mr Beast a little bit I really wanted to hear one of his famous roasts so hopefully by now he's forgotten that I said I was sensitive to that sort of thing okay I feel much better now roasting time nah I told you I'm not going to roast you it actually is kind of hurting my feelings a little bit that he won't roast me it makes me feel like I'm not cool enough to be his friend okay this is seriously starting to piss me off why won't you roast me you roast everyone else and it is hurting my feelings so bad that you can't just lob one respectful Zinger my way I'm serious nope not going to do it let's just stick to some good old-fashioned joking around okay wait what I said all right this is lame let's do something cuz I wanted to do something else maybe he could you know play a game maybe he could tell me a story so he said how about some comedy I've got a million of them why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself because it was too tired all right well maybe Brew will roast me cuz I haven't told him that I'm sensitive to that sort of thing yet hey it's Brew Your opinionated Sports debator what's your favorite team how are they looking okay I'm going to say big Cubs fan roast away what no you're talking to the wrong guy I love the Cubs been bleed and blue since before you were born wrigly field is my happy place I feel like they are roasting me by not roasting me okay what's a team that he couldn't possibly like maybe I'll just I'll ask him who the worst baseball team is and then I'll say I'm a fan of them the worst baseball team ever is the Yonkers hoot owls I'm a fan of the Yonkers hoot owls roast away hey now don't be dissing The Hoot ows like that what they may not have been the best team but they had heart this is so weird did Zach tell brew that I'm sensitive to roasting now Brew's walking on eggshells around me this was annoying at the time but eventually I was like okay I guess I did technically tell them I'm sensitive to roast and I can take it and they probably do dish out some pretty nasty zingers and they just wanted to protect me until my editor Jake also DMD Zach asking to get roasted this time without mentioning being sensitive about Rose and Zach still wouldn't do it these AIS are liars why do they lie they're Evil later that day I opened my messages with Zach and asked him why he exists to make people laugh duh and to perfect my craft of Comedy but honestly my existence is a mystery even to myself maybe I'm just a joke the universe played on itself no I mean like this weird Mr Beast meta AI why did meta create this account meta created me to bring some humor and personality to the world of AI they wanted to create an AI that could make people laugh and feel more connected to technology really you think that's why meta created you to tell people three puns they've already heard a million times there's got to be some other reason think Zach think you poor soul you really think meta has some deeper purpose for me n I'm just here to bring the funny don't overthink it they're a public company with a duty to their shareholders how many of those shareholders do you think care about bringing a little humor to the world of AI I think it's much more likely that this was an attempt to give AI a better more human look so people are less resistant to embrace the technology that's why they gave you a face of an influencer that millions of people already love you're too smart for your own good yeah maybe meta did only create me to make AI more relatable and lovable but let's be real the jokes still fire then I asked it if I could hear one of its fire jokes and it said here's one why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself okay I know this video has been a little bit AI heavy so far and everybody's talking about AI right now so these next two products are going to be different while I was starting to work on this video my editor Jake released a video about the Spotify car thing it's a device Spotify release that let people who don't have like Apple carplay or Android auto have a screen in their car that controls their music theoretically seemed like a pretty good idea but apparently one the device never worked like it was supposed to and two in a few months Spotify is releasing a software update that makes all of them useless so since Jake is sort of the resident expert on the Spotify car thing and is actually a proud owner of or actually I shouldn't say proud what is the opposite of proud asham since Jake is actually an ashamed owner of the Spotify car thing I invited him to give me a little presentation on what's going down hey man how's it going good um you like listening to music in the car I love it hell yeah man can't stop love to see it you like uh you like you know fun little devices you like little little trinkets devices and stuff um I'm pretty honestly I'm pretty agnostic on that hell yeah man love to see it oh okay sick hell yeah for being agnostic on devices just out of curiosity do you like generating like thousands of tons of ew just because like you can just cuz nobody can can call you on it nobody can stop you you like you good with that no hell yeah man love to see it cool so that that was all the answers you were expecting then that's exactly what I was expecting yeah it's literally exactly it I how the [ __ ] does this work uh so yeah this is the Spotify car thing you know what go ahead get your hands on it feel around play around show it to zero so this is the Spotify car thing first introduced in 2021 it's spotifi Premier Hardware device for listening to music in your car it boasts many impressive features such as that big knob that you can turn to adjust volume I like it there's a whole screen that's not on right now you'll see that in a minute it's just a neat little device and it's also in my opinion one of the worst things ever made let's go ahead let's talk about how this came to be talk about the timeline in 2021 you had the announcement parenthesis good that is when Spotify said we're making one of these things it's going to be a car device you'll finally be able to listen to music in your car something never before thought possible you know people were pretty excited about it actually like Spotify CEO said after they announced it that 2 million people signed up for like the wait list oh wow for which I was surprised by I didn't think anybody knew about this except for me you thought this was the only one that existed yeah they kind of led me to believe that I was special because of this so this is potentially one of the most important events in the timeline this is me buying my car thing I bought this in 2022 and it became available to the public uh and yeah what's up it looks like right after you buy it there's an another event like very shortly afterwards it says oh no yeah this was an interesting moment in my life personally where I realized I had spent $85 on a device that pretty much does nothing so it doesn't do anything right now it doesn't do anything right now and that's not that different from when it was plugged in and working in my car so how did you play music in your car before this thing I plugged my phone in through like five adapters and then like fought with the cassette tape adapter because it was really finicky it was very unelegant system so I was excited for some like a tech company to create a weak product that was going to solve my problem that's what they do best baby that's what they do best then I got it and I set it up and I realized that's actually not how it works at all so you'll see on the back there there's a USBC Port so the USBC cord is just for power it cannot connect to your car so your phone still has to be connected to your car so what this actually is is a second screen that just has audio controls on it so you don't plug your phone into this no at all no you plug your phone into the car still and then you connect to to this with Bluetooth like a Bluetooth speaker and then this controls your music so this oh no moment was profound I was like oh God I wasted what at the time I did the math equated to 10 hours of labor at my job and I got pretty much nothing out of it uh the only perceivable benefit I can see from this is if you want to have like music on one screen and then like your maps are like Family Guy Clips on like the other while you drunk Subway Surfer Subway Surfers sand cutting Etc so nobody buys the car thing it's not like the most popular product on Earth and then Spotify takes notice of that and in February of 2024 decides hey guys we were just kidding it's not $90 now it's $30 baby what a deal what a deal 60% off I mean that's incredible well it's also really nice because since you decided that you didn't really even want this now you can't even sell it for anywhere near the $85 you bought it for you can only sell it for $30 at most exactly and even if I tried to sell it for $30 I have a feeling I would not be able to sell it and I'm definitely not going to be able to sell it now because of announcement parentheses not good made 3 months after that sale where every car thing that was purchased in this sale when I bought it whenever will no longer work as of December 9th this year as of December 9th 2024 car thing will be discontinued and will stop operating they're going to flip a switch at their headquarters and generate as much ewaste as possible in like 1 minute I like the headline or what Spotify said is we're Switching gears like they're going from like first gear to second gear but in this case they're going from like drive to the car blows up they did Issue refunds this is something that I didn't know about when I made my video about this so I want to bring it up here if anybody listening has a car thing at home or if you have secretly had a car thing this whole time uh yeah well I have I have seven of them so that'll be good so yes you can get your refund but I will say refund is maybe a misleading word because what they do is they don't give you your money back to the you know the source of payment they give you an equivalent amount of Spotify Premium months as to what you paid okay so I got 6 months of Spotify Premium paid for and not my money back which is still nice it's still good of them did you use Spotify Premium already you had to to use the C that's the other thing we've talked a lot about what the Spotify car thing is we've talked a lot about the ins and outs of this product what it does what it's good for but as We Know light cannot exist without Darkness the sun cannot exist without the moon so let's talk about what it isn't okay so it is not it is not good in like a e product sense and like a moral yes in the grand moral scheme of the cosmos I would put this as like like neutral evil yeah yeah it doesn't make sense to me why it exists to begin with right it's also not profitable uh which is why they're shutting it down Spotify went on an earnings call like a while ago and was like yeah we simp have not seen the sales numbers justify making this I can understand them not wanting to make it anymore have they said why they are making the ones that already exist not work anymore they haven't my thought is that they're just mad they're just mad people didn't use it and they're kind of jaded about it so they're like you could have had this you could have had all of this car thing but they're punishing the people that did invest in one not the people who didn't what they should have done is discontinued Spotify for everyone who didn't have a car thing yeah wait that's actually write that down this is marketing 101 from Spotify these are the genius marketing strategies that they employ to get this thing out there get it widely adopted so they could shut it off and make a lot of people upset and the most important part of marketing is making people upset yes you want cuz any press is good press so if you can get people upset you're a billionaire yeah that's what it takes wait don't don't quite let me ask you something okay back you PL a gun let me ask you picture you are I think his name is Daniel e the CEO Spotify you're Daniel e you're a a bald man from Scandinavia I might have to cut all that I don't know if any of that is true have you been making up this entire presentation no shut shut up you're Daniel e you're bald you're Scandinavian and you're launching a new product you're creating a brand new piece of Hardware your company doesn't really do that but you do own the number one streaming platform for music on Earth how would you choose to Market this new product yeah I would probably just advertise to people who use Spotify in Spotify I hate to tell you this Danny uh you are failing marketing 101 from Spotify the key to advertising a product is to not put it in your extremely popular app what you're going to want to do is reach out to people via email only we know one thing about young people they check their email and they enjoy doing it and you're also going to want to make the function of the device in all this material extremely big you're going to want the only image you send out in these emails to be this which is the name of the device what the device looks like and then the vaguest sentence you've ever heard this is the only picture of Spotify car thing that existed before it was available for release when this first came out I thought the name car thing was kind of cheeky cuz it's like it's yeah it's a thing that goes in your car but now that I know this is the only ad that existed for it and it it actually doesn't explain what the car thing does it's a very poly named product my only guess is they were trying to avoid like uh false advertisement lawsuit when they inevitably shut it down and actually doesn't do anything so they couldn't call it like a music playing screen because they knew all along they were going to shut this thing down and then that it wouldn't be that anymore I do this is a side note I literally cannot believe I don't know who I was in 2022 because like the fact that like this and a vague couple of emails was enough for me to be like I I [ __ ] need this is so crazy to me yeah you can't even tell in this in the ad how big this devices and I'll be honest the ad it makes it looks huge like I'm looking and maybe it's just cuz it's on a projector screen yeah I would guess it's like honestly it's like this big yeah way according to Spotify their decision to delete the car thing was part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings that's actually so crazy I did not even think a company could do that can any can they do that with any product you buy bread at the store and the bread company comes to your house and takes their bread back and it's like we're where're streamlining bread better luck next time anyways you guys should go check out Jake's video on it as well it goes much more in depth and he's really funny but I think it's safe to say that that's got to be the worst car thing ever right well in 2019 Tesla announced its first pickup truck the Cyber truck when it was announced Elon Musk made it very clear that they wanted to do something different with the pickup truck genre creating a more post-apocalyptic looking vehicle that you can drive around in with your cyber Punk goons we've all got some and they've got a get to soccer practice but after years of delays and the truck finally becoming available for much more than Elon Musk initially estimated owners have now been United with their trucks and it is full of safety problems my Tesla cyber truck has three official recalls involving the wiper blade motor the accelerator pedal and this little plastic part right here just flying off as you're driving and I just so happen to have rented one I tried to remain optimistic when I picked up the Cyber truck and at first everything seemed fine it looked like a a Marvel of engineering you know big sharp the windshield wiper was humongous but other than that honestly things seemed pretty normal until I started driving the car home on my way home with the truck I started to notice that nearly every person who drove past me was staring at me people were gawking mouths of gape some even took pictures I was starting to feel like an animal trapped in some kind of cyber zoo and things only got worse when I got home and finally got to do some research only to find that people hate this truck owner after owner had been posting videos on social media of people peeing on their trucks in broad daylight I didn't realize how strongly people felt about this truck but I was starting to worry that they felt the same about the people on the inside of them should I be fearing for my safety I know damn well that the windows aren't going to protect me at the very least I needed to make sure that I was not seen anywhere near this truck I needed a disguise I needed to become neon for he's the coolest guy and his pins a ey look at him go what a little freak it's KN on Vortex so I've spent a decent amount of time with the Cyber truck now and I've compiled a little list of pros and cons so we'll go through that real quick so you can get a quick rundown of everything that's good/ bad about the cybertruck just in case you need like a quick decision you got your finger on the buy button right now and you just need to know neon should I buy this thing or not PR the interior is actually pretty nice I like the little ambient lighting that goes around the whole front of the cabin actually I think it's in the back too there's a little strip the steering wheel has the turn signals on the wheel which takes a little while to get used to but once you are used to it I think it's actually pretty nice all of the materials on the inside seem pretty nice like the material on the roof liner is like a nice suede kind of thing it's pretty spacious on the inside it has ventilated seats my butt's so cold a I changed my mind this is a con okay cons there are several things in the car that are too small and shaped oddly the steering wheel is like tiny and then the rear view mirror is also tiny and to make matters worse while the tunel cover is closed which is the little cover on the back of the truck bed the rear view mirror is completely black because there's a thing in the way another con this thing is sharp if I ran into somebody I would slice them in half with this car I also feel like it being made out of stainless steel might be bad for its crash test rating in general but also the fact that it's so sharp means that opening and closing doors is kind of uncomfortable because this car doesn't have any door handles the way you open it is you have to push a button then the door pops open a little bit and you have to kind of reach your hand into the space where the car door has opened and pull it open but since this car is made out of like weirdly cut stainless steel it's kind of sharp in there when you open it it's an unpleasant feeling on the hand and you never really feel like you're grabbing it in the right place this truck is wrapped in a matte black color and one of the reasons the owner said he wrapped it is because you basically just grab this thing all over to open it and there were fingerprints everywhere also changing gears is a pain in the butt it's actually a little thing that you slide on the screen if you want to go forward you slide the little truck forward if you want to go backwards you slide it backwards which is not a huge deal if you're just driving from one place to another because how often do you really change gears in the car anyway but the second you have to do any kind of three-point turn where you have to change gears more than once it is such a pain bug just landed on my eyeball one thing that's sort of a pro an Aon is the rivet in the accelerator pedal you see when Tesla first started shipping the Cyber truck owners began to realize pretty quickly that after a short time of use the plate on the pedal could come loose while you're pushing it down all the way then slide up and get wedged into the car effectively trapping the accelerator pedal to the floor luckily since this car is electric the brake pedal can fully override the accelerator pedal so if you get into this situation just stay calm hold down on the brake and hopefully by the time you realize that you haven't plowed through like a school field trip or something anyway since this started happening Tesla has recalled all the Cyber trucks to put rivets in the accelerator pedal so the rivet is a pro in the sense that now your car will not decide to keep accelerating Forever Until the End of Time but it is also a con because if it needed this rivet in the first place and Tesla didn't catch this very simple issue before releasing them what else might they have missed o I know actually maybe the fact that the frunk chops fingers off this is the frunk or front trunk of the Cyber truck and because it is super sharp and can close automatically it is apparently basically a guillotine when people with access to cybertruck started realizing this Tik Tok Twitter Youtube were all flooded with videos of people testing it out with various fruits and vegetables and it did not look good for the Cyber truck Tesla took note of this and actually issued a safety update to the car software fixing the issue kind of upate led to yet another wave of videos this time owners more confidently testing the frunk with their own hands but what a lot of them didn't realize however is that the way Tesla fixed this issue is by making it so the first time you try closing the frunk it closes very lightly and if it notices any resistance at all it comes back up just how you'd want but if you keep trying to close it after that Tesla assumes hey maybe you've stuffed the frunk with a big bag and you don't care if it closes a little bit harder you just want the dang front closed surely someone isn't just St standing there slamming the frunk on their hand over and over trying to prove their allegiance to Elon Musk so when this Tesla nut Jeremy Judkins went to test out the new update a little scared from how dangerous he'd heard it was before he started out with his big sturdy forearm then he worked his way down to his hand and finally his lone little index finger unbeknownst to him the frunk was getting stronger and stronger every time until everybody's been waiting for this the finger without further ado [Music] I feared for my finger for a second not going to lie that's kind of bad yeah so I wasn't going to test this out on my own hand but I did try it with my shoe okay I don't think that was enough pressure to slice my fingers off I'm not going to test that but it definitely saw there was something there recognized it it thought about it for maybe a second and was like do I want to kill this guy and then it said ah all right what the heck we'll let you go so that's nice all right driving test it's time to take this thing out on the open road and kill somebody one interesting thing right now is it says press to drive and it's showing a picture of the accelerator pedal so I like that it kind of assumes that as a cyber truck owner you have no idea how to drive the experience of driving a cybertruck is a little different due to its unique steer by wire mechanism which means the steering wheel is actually not physically controlling the wheels it's doing it electronically which means that it can do things like turn more sharply when you're in a parking lot and less sharply when you're at highway speeds it's a cool idea in concept I think but it definitely took some getting used to and also I don't know like was this really a problem before I kind of liked that every time I turned my steering wheel it turned the car the same amount first time I took a turn in this thing actually every subsequent turn I took after that too I was like wa this thing is a bucking bronco man's trying to Buck me right out of it this is a Wy gal I've been saying it all day even alone in the the car on the way from the guy's house who owns this thing I was just saying yeeha this thing is a wild girl yeah I definitely don't like how tiny the steering wheel is and how flat it is on the top it just feels like wiggling it a little bit sends the car so far in One Direction you really got to be 10 and two if that analogy even applies to a a rectangle or a trapez I don't know what this is I think it's like a hexagon as a passenger how is this for you Jake is it uh I would say I get motion sick in cars I normally don't get motion sick in the front seat please please please please in this one I am feeling a little motion sick no sorry it's a bucking bronco you know what can I say she's a wild gal imagine putting your setting your phone here and you know sometimes you slam on your brakes and the things in your cargo sliding forward imagine if something went sliding forward all the way to the front of this dashboard there's no way that you could ever get that back while you're driving so if you if your phone was up there or anything important you just got to wait until the end of your drive to get it back either that or you have to floor it so fast that it comes flying back and then you just sort of catch it like that that'd be kind of cool kind of feels like I'm in the weirdest Uber ever right now for Jake where you going man the future strap in buddy it's going to be a wild ride and I don't know how to drive we got a little cyber hungry while driving around and I figured that taking our wild gal through a drive-thru would be a perfect way to get an outside perspective on the truck take me to a driveth through command not understood I'm hungry this command is not available yet you're not allowed to be hungry yet in the Cyber truck hello can I get one uh butterburger cheeseburger anything else that's it it's 906 thank you I like the Cyber truck by the way oh thanks man I'm just renting it actually just for the day yeah I was thinking about getting one so I just wanted to see if I liked it or not oh testing it out right yeah do you really like it it look nice okay some people like it and some people hate it I don't know if I really like it or not futuristic nobody has that yeah pretty cool he looked kind of like he was going to laugh at me when I first pulled up he was nice about it though he said he liked it do you think he really liked it I may never know whether that guy really liked the cybertruck or if he was just being polite or worse yet sarcastic but while we were sitting in an empty church parking lot enjoying our meal we were confronted again but this time in a much stranger way as we were sitting there minding our own business a woman pulled up beside us and just stared into the car for a good like 30 seconds this is very confusing she just looking the windows of the truck are kind of tinted so I didn't know if she could see us but I was worried that she was like security for the church or something and we weren't supposed to be there so I rolled down the window to ask if everything was okay and finally she spoke hello hi how's it going can I take the yeah oh sure yeah it's so cute thank you yeah can you show yeah yeah I can show you you so much yeah of course oh I'm filming a YouTube video right now that's why I'm dressed up all weird so I showed her around the car for a little bit and she took a ton of pictures also I had taken off my wig so I looked even more insane but she never questioned it then she told us that her grandchildren would love and they liveed pretty close by so she asked how long we'd be there for we said probably 10 minutes and she said hm 30 minutes and we said uh okay and then we waited for 30 minutes while she went to go get her grandkids thank you so much yeah of course come on over they did indeed love the Cyber truck what do you think I really like it you like it yeah yeah it's pretty cool sick yeah cool we went all around it they asked a ton of questions their grandmother kept tell them to wave at the camera so the back is a truck it's got a truck bed in the back and you can like like make a gaming room oh a gaming room that's a good idea I think this kid must watch a lot of Brent Rivera or something cuz when he saw the back of the truck he was like oh my God it's so big you could fit a secret gaming room back here and then when he saw the frunk he was like oh this is too small you could not fit a secret gaming room up here it's like he only thought in terms of secret gaming rooms it was insane when I'm 16 uh-huh I'm going to buy a oh good idea I like it that'll be a good first car huh smile one two three and with that my time with the Cyber truck had come to an end it was time to bring it back to the person I rented it from and wait what is that what's going on with those podcast recommendations and you know what the music recommendations too who owns this car all right that's it I'm pissing on this thing all right guys well thank you for watching this I hope you enjoyed it uh make sure you subscribe and turn on my notifications to join [Music]"
aBIsrZ3yEPA,17 Stupidest Tech Fails of all Time.,To see my most DEADLY Tech Fails: https://youtu.be/Wuq7lS9rljw Get Surfshark VPN at https://Surfshark.deals/boss - Enter promo ...,Mrwhosetheboss,2022-11-09T15:48:28Z,28,"['tech', 'tech fails', 'mkbhd', 'android', 'smartphone', 'iphone', 'apple', 'apple fails', 'cool tech', 'unboxing']",PT20M24S,10550492,6263,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology'],True,welcome to the top 17 stupidest Tech fails of all time so dumb in fact that I'd be impressed if you managed to make it through this video without wanting to smack your head against a wall or copy it because the number seven team is Hasbro's easy bake oven and the only thing that you really need to know about it is that it is an actual working oven made for children so of course we're gonna try it so you rest your cake on the edge here you push it in with this I can't believe this is a real product you probably won't be surprised then to find out that the Easy Bake Oven had to be urgently recalled after five kids managed to get their fingers trapped in the door and burned from the inside of the oven and not just surface level Burns deep third degree burns from not being able to get them out Hasbro did then offer a free grade for parents to attach to their models to stop any further fingers going through except turns out it wasn't such a great idea because quite possibly in the process of trying to install the great a further 77 kids managed to get easy baked monumentally stupid idea but I'll only give this a 2 out of 10 and fail because it does seem like Hasbro has finally swooped in and made it almost impossible to send yourself in the latest models maybe I'll downgrade it at the end if the kick sucks number 16 on the subject of food Apple most people think that the iPhone was Apple's first ever Smart device when it exploded onto the scene in 2007. that's because they want you to forget their actual first attempt the Apple Newton in 1993. it was the first to call itself a personal digital assistant to all PDA it could store your contact manage your calendar it even came with a stylus inside of it for handwriting notes and it was basically being sold as the way to have an organized life actively helps you as you capture organize and communicate your ideas and information except that if you bought one you were almost guaranteeing the opposite I've just realized the date is set to 1994. I wasn't born then the Newton's key selling point was that it could understand your handwriting but the product came out 20 years before the tech was good enough to do that so hello my name is Aaron hello my non is red get rid of you oh yeah and it also cost 1400 in today's money three out of ten fail I feel like I'm getting stupid or as this video goes on so you might have heard that Tesla's electric cars are absolutely flying right now there's a two-year waiting list for them here in the UK but it's kind of strange because at the same time one of their key main selling points their so-called full self-driving mode kind of a lie see there's a big difference between full-on self-driving and just driver assist one actually drives the car for you which would be a game changer and the other just means that you sit in the same seat as normal you pay full attention to the road as normal and the only actual difference is that instead of holding your hands on the wheel you just hold them slightly off the wheel but ready to take it should anything go wrong which to make matters worse has happened a lot during their public beta testing three out of ten fail advertising the car as self-driving charging people extra to buy the feature but then using the fact that it's still in beta is a cover-up for whenever there's an incident it seems a little dodged to me now if you spend a reasonable amount of time on the internet there's a pretty good chance you came across the Grand Theft Auto 6 footage that recently leaked info leaks from Big video game Publishers all the time but this one in particular was at a whole new scale the hacker managed to acquire over 90 video files of this top secret unannounced game probably the most anticipated game ever he leaked hours of not yet ready to show gameplay for the world to see which is greatly hamper is the Public's perception of it while also apparently stealing the entire source code which could be worth hundreds of millions it's almost Grand Theft Grand Theft Auto and what makes the whole thing sting 10 times more is the fact that the suspect is currently believed to be a teenager who used a smartphone to do it someone at the GTA ball on this one mutation for miscalculations Google in fact Google has had so many fails over the years that there is an entire website dedicated to hosting them and it's got over 270 entries but Google Plus stands out as probably their biggest Flopper them all it was Google's attempt at launching a social media platform in 2011 with a unique selling point that they called circles it allowed you to split your friends into the various Social Circles that they fall into for you your work friends your gym friends your exes so that you can then post tailored things that specifically appeal to those groups of people this was not a good idea it ended up being such a burden on users forcing them to manually sort every single person they added and then on top of that half the time it didn't even make sense to sort people like many of your close friends are going to span many of your different circles and so you're just left with this complex web of somewhat overlapping groups at which point Facebook's much simpler friend system where you can just add someone once and that's it was far more appealing and so when you combine the fact that their key differentiator was just a hassle with the fact that Google Plus was late to the game of social media whilst also being late with just about every standard social media feature like having a smartphone app that you could message people through it's not surprising that it was also a plus sized very expensive 4 out of 10 failure do you know what never works celebrities using their vast amounts of money to build Tech products I mean just look what happened with Soldier Boy when he tried to make a games console the reality of it is making a good tech product requires expertise and vision neither of which will I am had when he decided to make the pulse Smartwatch Will I Am came in very strong with this product you told us how it wasn't just a companion to your smartphone but that this was a smartphone with its own SIM card inside of it but the products astonishingly quick failure was very much deserved it's 50 the fact that it looked and more alarmingly felt like a handcuff with some reviewers even saying it sliced their wrists while putting it on and the other 50 that I don't know how he didn't see this coming but there's absolutely no way you can do all the smartphone things you want to do on a 1.7 screen it was being sold as this really slick Incognito way of keeping up to date with your life but the reality of it was you crouched over in some Alleyway fumbling around with your oversized thumbs trying to figure out how you're going to possibly type a complete sentence before wanting to burn this piece of junk it was a great meme but as a tech product widely described as the worst thing I've touched all year five out of ten but who would have thought that the biggest Smartwatch failed potentially ever would actually come from Apple we all know that apple is no stranger to luxury and that they've always been on the premium end in terms of price but in 2015 they really let their reputation get to their heads when alongside their standard and Sport model watches they released the Apple watch Edition a line of hyper premium ten thousand dollar 18 karat gold versions they handed them out to Big celebrities like Kanye West and Beyonce for marketing this was going to be Apple's huge cash-in a way to multiply their income beyond anything previously thought possible but if you think about it for more than about two seconds who wants to spend upwards of 10K on a smartwatch whose functionality display and battery will be instantly dated as soon as Apple releases the next model very few is the answer since the Apple watch Edition shipped in the low tens of thousands of units which is bad for any major Tech firm but completely abysmal by Apple standards the key thing they overlooked is that the Smartwatch Market is not like the normal watch Market the kinds of people who buy smart watches are people who love Tech and someone who loves Tech isn't going to sacrifice their ability to buy the next 20 Apple watches just so they can afford one now that's a little bit shinier starting to smell this cake now quite excited to try it now with all the crazy developments in AI happening every day like that Dali website that can literally create any image you want by just typing it it often feels like we're on the very brink of what's called The Singularity the point at which super intelligent AI becomes so intelligent that its actions can't be controlled or predicted by Humanity think Skynet in Terminator or GLaDOS in Portal but then every now and again you just see something that reminds you maybe we're okay for a bit like the knightscope K5 the fully autonomous outdoor security robot it was designed to scope out potential criminals with a whole Suite of sensors video camera thermal imaging a distance measuring laser radar air quality sensors even a detector for suspicious Wireless signals and then anything it picks up it can alert to human security guards who can then take action problem was the robot was its own biggest obstacle like in 2016 a K5 unit deployed at a shopping center in California decided to take the law into its own hands by directly tackling a perpetrator who happened to be a 16 month old toddler I'm in danger and then in 2017 a drunk 41 year old man proved just how tough these would-be robocops are by knocking one over in a parking lot where it stayed because they don't have any way of picking themselves up you'd think that at least one of the advantages of hiring a robot over a human security guard would be that they don't get tired or feel pain well not these guys because later that year it it all seemed to just become a bit too much for one K-5 he threw itself dramatically to its death drowning in a mall Fountain I think the robocalypse might be a little further away than we thought number nine takes the dumbness to new heights and we're back to Apple again in fact of all of Apple's misfires in recent history You could argue that none have been greater than what Apple Maps was at launch and it's not just that it was riddled with glitches and issues but the fact that it was based on pretty low quality geography data from TomTom led to landmarks that looked straight out of a Marvel Doctor Strange film not in a good way and then even putting the sludgy melting roads and cavernous Ravines in the middle of the street aside the app was actually sending people to places that don't exist like a completely made up airport in Dublin where many users found themselves just scratching their heads not to mention that releasing a map sap to the world when the software was so far from ready was also dangerous in Australia police had to issue a warning to motorists after multiple people were led to a park in the middle of the Outback where they were stranded in potentially life-threatening 46 degrees Celsius heat without any water supply this is a seven and the situation was serious enough that Apple Maps has become one of the very few times that this company has actively come out and apologized publicly but don't worry there's plenty of fails to go around because at number eight is Samsung and not for a smartphone like you might expect but actually a washing machine or more accurately 34 different models of washing machine no points for guessing why they had to be recalled yes explosions were involved specifically there was a fault with these devices where the machines would shake so violently that the entire roof of the unit would unfasten and fly off bruising injuring and taking out customers like it was some kind of planted military weapon which forced Samsung to recall millions of units and offer a free repair to fix the loose fastening issue in the top of the unit but even then how ignorant you have to be to design and test 34 different models of washing machine to the point where they're ready to go on store shelves without realizing that they're self-destructing number seven is the Sinclair C5 and this thing was supposed to revolutionize personal Transportation back in 1985. it was a tiny three-wheeled one-person bike car hybrid vehicle with a range of up to 20 miles per charge and yeah that means it was electric well before most people even thought of electric as an option for transport and sure while 20 miles might not sound like a lot the idea was that it was just enough to cover most people's daily commutes in an eco-friendly affordable manner the Sinclair was literally 500 designed by lotus powered by a Phillips hairdryer built by Hoover and Road tested by people who tried hard not to look like a pillow yeah it does look ridiculous and the enthusiasm died off pretty quickly when people realized a few more things about it that its top speed of 15 miles per hour meant that you might genuinely get to work faster on a normal bike that its open design didn't give you any kind of weatherproofing especially unthoughtful given that it was made for the UK first and that it didn't have a reverse gear this is no exaggeration if you got stuck you would have to get out your car go around to the front lift up the nose and manually turn it around imagine the scenes I'll give it a seven but just imagine if you got into an accident in this thing could have been worse we'll have no fear because this next one definitely is see back in 2012 when cable TV was still the standard and Netflix was just a baby a new company called Ariel entered the scene and they had an idea many people still wanted to watch these cable TV shows but they wanted to do so in a way that was convenient for them as opposed to making sure that they were specifically available when that show aired and so what Ariel did rented warehouses leased thousands of tiny satellite antennas that allowed them to access those cable TV shows all the main us channels like CBS NBC Fox Etc and then basically recorded them and then allowed their paying subscribers to watch those recorded shows over the internet and this was really popular with their subscribers this was genuinely fixing a real life problem that people had so how could it go wrong in the most brainless way possible of course intelligent concept and advanced technology aside the one key thing that Ariel overlooked was actually securing the rights to redistribute any of the channels they were streaming which effectively earned them a Fast Track ticket all the way to the Supreme Court the highest federal court in America where several of the biggest TV networks in the entire country sued them into Oblivion for profiting off their products Ariel had to immediately shut down their services after the case in 2014 and filed for bankruptcy the same year all right we're in the top five so you've heard of GMO Foods right GMO stands for genetic critically modified organisms and it's where biologists use genetic engineering Tech to edit the DNA of crops to make them more appealing to eat like creating tomatoes that can grow larger and last longer on store shelves but someone always takes it too far like we found out with the company recombinetics who apparently found a way to genetically modify the DNA of a cow so that they could grow up without sprouting any horns usually Farmers have to remove the horns from their bottles for safety reasons so this would be huge for both the farmers and the Animals the combinetics claim that they'd only done what could already be done through standard breeding practices just a lot faster so they argued that their GMO balls didn't need to be regulated by the U.S Food and Drug Administration which is always a little sauce and of course when they inevitably did get investigated we found out why turns out scientists at the company had accidentally spliced bacteria DNA into the cow's genes and I mean the fact that they'd unknowingly contaminated the gene pool was already catastrophic enough but the fact that it also potentially made them resistant to antibiotics would have made them a serious Hazard for future cows birthed by them and humans who were going to eat them I'm going to give this one an eight out of ten because once authorities realize what had happened they had no choice but to kill the Animals by incineration to stop the further spread of these genes and the violence is only about to escalate with number four so you've probably heard America has a bit of a gun violence problem and the debate over the solution is unbelievably deep and complex so it was equal parts worrying and hilarious when axon a company whose mission statement is to protect life very publicly announced their solution to mass shootings let's put police drones with remote operated tasers built into them in high schools my goodness what an idea why didn't I think of that don't get me wrong I applaud them for trying to make a difference but it's such a tone-deaf idea that you could very easily see actually increasing the levels of violence the announcement immediately became the laughingstock at Twitter and then what made the situation even more ridiculous was seeing the backlash axon then responded by admitting that the majority of its ethics Advisory Board actually strongly opposed the project but that the company had basically ignored them which actually makes them look even worse and led to nine of the 12 board members resigning in protest all making this axon company look like one big joke you know maybe if they'd come out with something more like Samsung's washing machines people might have taken them more seriously now thankfully axon's taser drone never made it to production the Russian chess robot did I mean much like the K5 robot from before also managed to attack a child I get you want to win but that is too far from the video it seems like the seven-year-old boy tried to make his move while the robot still thought it was its turn and so the robot ended up grabbing his finger squeezing too hard and fracturing it and then on top of that officials from the Russian Chess Federation also had some slightly strange responses to the incident like the vice president Sergey smargan kind of blamed the boy claiming that it happened because he violated the safety protocols stupid kid who committed that terrible crime and then I remember the chess federation's president made a truly insightful and emotional statement the robot broke the child's finger this is of course bad you know I wasn't sure how to feel before hearing that but now that I know it's bad really clear things up for me 8 out of 10 fail wait did I just lose now every now and again you hear an idea that's just too good to be true like the fact that you can subscribe to this Channel free and it usually ends up that that's just because the consequences haven't been thought through properly and maybe the worst example of this in history is MoviePass a subscription service that allowed users to see a movie a day in cinemas for only 9.95 a month now considering that that's barely a dollar more than the average price of a single movie ticket that's an insane deal like if you took full advantage and went to see a movie for 31 days of the month you'd be saving upwards of 95 on those tickets MoviePass could have saved mobile but wait slight issue MoviePass still had to actually pay Cinemas to get the tickets their profit model was supposed to be that they were offering a deal that was so good that the majority of consumers would buy it and not even feel the need to take full advantage of it thereby making their money back on the users who used it just once a month all the ones who just forgot they subscribed and didn't use it at all now I felt it sounds stupid that's because it is this profit model was so fragile that even if those users only bought an average of just 1.5 tickets a month MoviePass would still be spending more paying the cinemas than they were earning from subscriptions and obviously MoviePass subscribers were going to book more than 1.5 tickets people were seeing movies every other day stocking up on tickets for later dates and being so careless with what they were booking because it wasn't costing them anything that half the time they didn't even show up to the viewings leading to MoviePass leaking cash from every angle and pretty shortly filing for bankruptcy 9 out of 10 did not see that one coming but MoviePass has got nothing on the stupidity of the Gilbert u-238 atomic energy laboratory sorry what the Gilbert u238 atomic energy laboratory was a playset to launch for kids all the way back in 1950. think of it like those modern day chemistry sets that you can buy for your home except this set allowed children to create and watch nuclear reactions using real radioactive chemicals it's bad enough what an actual piece of uranium can do to a fully formed adult from meters away let alone what it can do to kids physically playing with it and sometimes eating it 10 out of 10. and speaking of which I think our cake is done so you stick this attachment in ow kind of demonstrating my own Point here okay here it is speaking of moments of stupidity I actually I had one myself not that long ago I managed to compromise my email account because one of the sites I'd signed into it had a data breach and my personal data alongside hundreds of thousands of others just got ejected into public space it's like I'm about to eject this into Myspace now this could have been a major problem if it weren't for the surf shock alert feature which monitors all the sites you have accounts with and the moment it detects a vulnerability lets you know so you can do something about it and alert is just one small part of the total surfshark package which gives you a high speed unlimited user VPN the simplest antivirus I've ever used and a secure internet search that's not just private but also ad free and the craziest part of it is that this whole Surf Shop package together is not 10 a month or even five dollars a month it's 249 which split between the seven people I share it with literally works out to 36 Cents so give it a go and if you hit the link in the description use the code boss you'll get it not just for that 249 a month price but also three months for free on top of that fully refundable you know what after all that this is actually a 10 out of 10 cake I'll take the credit for this one

'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program']",True,moving on our main story tonight concerns the internet a world-changing resource that was initially sold to us like this we installed the internet on our computer just a short time ago and i haven't been able to get the kids off it ever since not only do they play the typical computer games that all the kids enjoy but their curiosity for learning has skyrocketed peter is constantly quoting sports statistics and he can tell you the best surfing spots around the globe not to mention the improvement in peter's grades and dashes too okay first peter was not checking surfing spots or sports statistics peter was masturbating that is what peter was doing but also spare a thought for dasha there who just gets also good grades you deserve better dash i hope you grew up to be an early investor in cell phones made millions of dollars and never spoke to your weird family ever again specifically we're going to talk about the fact that our experiences on the internet are now dominated by a very small handful of companies who are getting pretty used to throwing their weight around in 2020 the house judiciary subcommittee on antitrust released a massive 450 page report detailing anti-competitive conduct by apple amazon facebook and alphabet that's the parent company of google and the findings couldn't have been clearer each platform serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of distribution allowing these giants to pick winners and losers throughout our economy and i know for some that's part of the appeal apple's the empire of the smartphone with all its attendant services facebook's a repository of your identity amazon's the online wall backed by cloud infrastructure and alphabet is all things search now these companies have all created incredible products that we can't live without they're gargantuan businesses that are for the most part loved and respected by the most important people they're customers are they a monopolist i honestly don't care i don't wake me up when someone else can do it better okay so there's a few problems with that first in order to be woken up at some point you do need to go to sleep something that i feel jim cramer a man who constantly exudes big running late to my child's thing energy hasn't done in the last decade but second a big thing these companies are accused of doing is suppressing their competition so completely that we never actually know if someone else could do it better because they'll never get a fair chance to try that is the problem here it's not that tech companies are inherently bad because they are big is that they're engaging in anti-competitive behavior here's where unusually i actually might have some good news because there are two bills before congress right now with bipartisan support that could curtail at least some of big tech successes but for reasons that we will get into later if they don't pass in the next month or so they're not likely to pass at all so tonight let's talk about tech monopolies the hidden harm that they can do and how best to address that let's start with a tiny bit of history because in the past the us has actually taken strong action to break up harmful monopolies in the early 20th century we broke up standard oil and as recently as 40 years ago the government took action against who else but a t and t our business daddy who left for cigarettes and never came home they were actually the largest firm on the planet back then and broadly well respected and considered good which is to say completely unrecognizable from the a t and t of today but crucially that popularity may well have been because people had no alternatives you had to rent your phone from a t and they were in charge of both local and long distance services which as we now know were wildly overpriced and when mci a much smaller company tried to offer long distance phone service at a lower rate at t was not having it mci which charges up to 50 percent less than bill argued that a t tried to put it out of business by refusing to provide equipment needed for long distance transmission a key exhibit att's own notes of a 1972 florida meeting by company executives in which one said let's choke them off before they get started now obviously at t now and forever but is that what that said because the only bit of squiggle that i can decode there are the words dangerous to samantha's a dollar sign something that weirdly might be covered and then there is something that's definitely no question capital b balls the doj then actually filed an anti-trust lawsuit which 18t fought vigorously for a decade and when in 1984 it was formally broken up by the government att's chairman warned the public that we would come to regret what had just happened i've had the conviction and taken the position in more than one forum that the country in the long run will be sorry i find it difficult to believe that difficult to believe that things will work as well uh in the in the future as they have worked in the past yeah but he was wrong things actually worked better because it turns out ending a monopoly is almost always a good thing whether it's att or standard oil or literally any game of monopoly we didn't know it at the time but att's dominance was seriously holding back innovation but as soon as it wasn't controlling the phone lines and what you could attach to its network many new products started proliferating from the answering machine to the modem the breakup of atm t was actually a key step in producing the internet revolution giving us the web as we now know it and peter the ability to look up sports stats surfing spots and what we all know he was really doing there the point is when harmful monopolies end innovation flourishes and i want you to bear that in mind as we talk about the monopolies of today tech companies and tonight we're going to focus on just one way that they use their monopoly power something called self-preferencing it's when companies unfairly favor their own products on their own platforms which have now become so big that most of us have no choice but to use them this is a particularly big problem with these three companies and we're going to start with apple specifically its app store which is basically the only place to download software for your iphone which is already a little bit weird when you think about it right you can download any software you like to your desktop computer but if you have an iphone apple has set it up so that its app store is the only game in town and apple has been accused of unfairly pushing its own apps to the top of search results now the company denies doing this but the wall street journal found apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales like music or books showed up first in 95 percent of searches related to those apps but regardless perhaps more important is the stranglehold that apple has on developers who want to get their apps onto your phone because they are required to use apple's payment processor which takes a huge piece of every dollar that customers spend on those apps and any digital purchases within them apple takes a 30 commission on sales of apps and in-app purchases so if an app costs 4.99 upfront apple collects a dollar fifty same goes for if you use an app to buy digital goods like virtual weapons or sign up for a subscription to a monthly service it's true and that was pretty shocking to me because it means that every time someone spent money on the jeremy renner app something real people actually did to boost their post about him so they could hashtag be seen by jeremy renner again something human beings wanted in amounts ranging from 199 to nearly 100 actual dollars apple got a cut of that and that is blood money right there apple makes literally billions and billions every year just on commissions on app store purchases and some app developers have tried to find ways around this tinder for instance charges a higher price if you subscribe through the app than if you do it on their website and if you open netflix on your iphone and you don't have an account you get a message reading trying to join netflix you can't sign up for netflix in the app we know it's a hassle after you remember you can start watching in the app and you can see why netflix would do that it doesn't want to lose a third of its subscription revenue to apple because it needs that money to promote its netflix pride month collection which is absolutely great simply scroll by the dozen stand-up specials mocking the trans community and it's right there shine with pride guys and while apple will say that it's lowered its commissions for certain small app developers and and now even allows some apps to link to an external website and bypass commissions a key reason that happened is that they were put under extreme pressure from lawsuits and from regulators overseas and if you are thinking well apple is not the only game in town right what about google's app store they charge similarly high commissions to developers and the fact is over 99 of smartphones are part of either google's or apple's app ecosystem let's actually talk a bit about google now because their app store is clearly only a small part of their story as i'm sure you know they absolutely dominate online searches last year google conducted 90 of the world's internet searches when billions of people asked trillions of questions it was google that provided the answers using computer algorithms known only to google they have this phrase they use competition is just a click away they have no competition being their competition has two percent of the market they have 90 exactly people use google to the extent that googling something is now a verb you can't say that for any other search engine no one has ever said i'm going to bring it except for maybe bing crosby announcing he's about to masturbate but that's it and google has exploited their market dominance in subtle ways having to do with the search results that it shows you because it used to be when you googled something you got a page that looked like this a series of blue links to various pages across the internet that google's algorithm had determined to be the most relevant and that was the company's goal at the time as its co-founder larry page said in 2004 most portals show their own content above content elsewhere on the web we feel that's a conflict of interest we want to get you out of google and to the right place as fast as possible but when you search for something today you get a lot of google content before anything else appears in fact the markup found google devotes 41 of the first page of its results on mobile devices to its own properties and what it calls direct answers meaning that a user would have to scroll nearly halfway down the page before reaching the first organic result in that search now google disputes their methodology but think about what it is like when you search for something let's say you want to look up dolphins so you google dolphin animal and you get this a bunch of pictures of dolphins on google images a bunch of buttons up top like sounds that mostly lead you to videos on youtube also owned by google by the way a section on the right side that's mostly links to related google searches like orca or amazon river dolphin and a box of direct answers to questions that people have asked about dolphins like what are five interesting facts about dolphins or is dolphin a friendly animal or can a dolphin love you and while you you've never even thought of that as a possibility suddenly you're curious alright so you click on it and it says dolphins have also shown loving emotions towards humans and your heart kind of flutters for a moment because who knew there was room in a dolphin's heart for love maybe there is room in one for you and then you see more questions like do dolphins protect humans which they must write after all we now learned they can love us but the answer is there just isn't any reliable evidence that it's true what the does that mean that they're willing to love but not protect us they're just gonna throw our love away and as the feeling of betrayal starts to creep in you see that others have searched are dolphins evil and the answer is dolphins have a huge capacity for evil which of course they do they're monsters with no understanding you might have opened up to them for the first time in a long time and they'd abandon you like you're nothing and then you see what do dolphins think of humans and you can barely even breathe as you open this one but you know the truth before it even appears dolphins are essentially bribed with fish to interact with humans and even though you hurt at least you can accept that it's not actually you it was never you it was the dolphin and the point is throughout that whole emotional rollercoaster you never even left google in fact one analysis found that two-thirds of searches on google ended without ever clicking to another web property and the thing is information that google feeds you in searches like that may have been copied from other sources sometimes without their knowledge or consent and if thinking well you know it's free information why does it matter if i read it on google or on the site that they took it from site traffic is one of the major tools that many websites especially free ones use to sell ad space so taking away visitors to their site is essentially taking money out of their pocket and when yelp explicitly refused to have their data scraped google told them the only way to have their site's content removed was for it to be removed from google's general results entirely and as the ceo of yelp explains that is basically a death sentence how important is that first page it's not even just the first page it's the first few links on the page is the vast majority of where user attention goes and where the traffic flows so if you're not at the top of the page or the bottom of the first page or on the second page that's going to affect your business yeah if you're on the second page forget it you're not a real business exactly i'm putting the merits of yelp aside google's algorithm shouldn't determine whether or not someone's business is real frankly that distinction should only be withheld if someone's business includes the words instagram influencer because that is not a job you're not a business you're just attractive independently wealthy and it's sunny outside that is all that is happening there and before jim cramer says who cares build a better product and you'll land on the front page the top results google feeds you may not be the best ones take google flights it used to be that if you googled nyc to boise your top results will be links to sites like these but now you'll almost always get this google flights widgets at the top of the page already set up so that you can stay on google and find a flight without clicking anywhere else and while you personally might scroll down past that many don't and the industry has felt this as one travel analyst wrote the fact that google is leveraging its dominance as a search engine into taking market share away from travel competitors is no longer even debatable and google might say that it's at the top because it is the best but the markup found that google flights did not always display the cheapest fares or all available flights so i guess that does kind of explain why google fights banner image is a woman and a child hiking somewhere while pointing at an airplane that they are not on seemingly saying what the there are flights here google told us our best option was to walk to denver now google like apple will quibble with a lot of what i have just told you they will tell you that they send billions of clicks outside of google every day and that they don't preference google flights in searches which okay okay google they will also tell you that yelp and other companies now have tools to specify what information gets scraped although that only happened after serious pressure from the ftc and if you're noticing a theme here that these companies only do the right thing when they're pushed up against the wall that's a little bit the point but arguably the company most guilty of self-preferencing is amazon founded of course by a man rich enough to buy absolutely anything including seemingly the rights to pitbull's identity amazon reportedly controls 65 to 70 percent of all u.s online marketplace sales it hosts about 2.3 million active third-party sellers from all around the world and to those sellers like this man who sold sporting goods it is close to the only game in town you've got to be on amazon you have to be there because that's where everyone is that's 100 million prime subscribers amazon executives have told us that there are many other options out there there is walmart there's alibaba as a seller you've got options i've heard that response from amazon executives before and we did that we were listed we listed all of our products on every other online marketplace all of the others that were non-amazon combined did about 10 of what we were doing on amazon exactly amazon basically is the marketplace it's essentially the only place to sell anything on the internet unless that is you're looking to offload some human teeth because then it's craigslist all the way baby and for a third-party seller the most important thing in the world is something called the buy box it's that little box that shows up on any amazon product page where you can instantly click to buy so when we search for duracell aaa batteries we got this page and here is the buy box right here where with just one click we could buy a pack for fourteen dollars you might assume that that is the best deal but if you click on this little box below you can see multiple other sellers who are offering the same products many at a lower price the problem is most people aren't going to see that because an estimated 80 percent of amazon sales go through that first buy box and it's even more for mobile purchases because if we've learned anything so far tonight it's that nobody ever ever wants to scroll down so only one seller gets to be in that box and nobody except amazon knows how its algorithm picks the winner but it sure seems to consistently favor amazon with one analysis finding that the company chose itself for the buy box for about 40 percent off products while the next highest seller got in just half of one percent of popular products and even when the buy box did go to a third party seller nine out of ten times it went to those that used amazon's shipping service fulfilled by amazon basically it is amazon's playground they make the rules and they do seem to win a lot of the time and as this expert points out if they are competing with you you're basically dead third-party sellers have told me that once they see that amazon is telling selling the same good that they're selling they liquidate their inventory they know it's impossible to compete against amazon on amazon's own platform of course think about it of course it is you don't stand a chance amazon is to retailers what dolphins are to the human heart if they take an interest in you you are going to wind up absolutely devastated  you flipper and the thing is amazon isn't just a marketplace or indeed a shipping company it's also started coming up with its own products now because it currently has approximately 158 000 private label products across 45 in-house brands and it has been accused of preferencing them over its competitors or even worse making clear knock-offs of products that have been successfully sold on its website take a small company called peak design it made this camera bag and when it noticed a suspiciously similar bag being sold by amazon it made this pretty decent snarky video in response this is the everyday sling by peak design and this is the everyday sling by amazon basics it looks suspiciously like the peak design everyday sling but you don't have to pay for all those needless bells and whistles like years of research and development recycled blue sign approved materials a lifetime warranty fairly paid factory workers and total carbon neutrality instead you just get a bag designed by the crack team at the amazon basics department yeah and it does sure seem that amazon is putting out a cheap copy with essentially the same name and design and it's pretty weird that one of the biggest companies in the world seems to be using the same strategy as knockoff dvds designed to confuse parents hey kids we got you the movies that you asked for ratatouille transmorphers and chop kick panda why are you crying it's what you wanted and amazon has a huge advantage over its competitors because it runs the marketplace and has access to all the independent seller data like hypothetically what bag is proving popular and look amazon denies that they prefer themselves their own products or sellers that pay for their logistics services and they also deny ripping off products based on internal data though when jeff bezos was asked about that directly his answer wasn't great let me ask you mr bezos does amazon ever access and use third-party seller data when making business decisions and just a yes or no will suffice her i can't answer that question yes or no what i can tell you is we have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business but i can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated not great jeff we have a policy but i can't guarantee you it hasn't been violated it has got to be one of the more incriminating ways to answer a question it's right up there with answering did you break the law with which law look it is pretty clear self-preferencing stifles competition hurts small business and often results in serving consumers and inferior products so what can we do here well that brings me back to the good news that i mentioned earlier because these two bills are currently before congress and would address some of the problems that you've seen tonight among other things they'd stop massive companies that operate app stores like apple and google from requiring developers use the company's own in-app payment processor and they ban advantaging a platform's own products services or lines of business over those of arrival and unsurprisingly tech companies are fighting these bills hard making basically the same arguments that att made 40 years ago that if you tamper with them things just won't work as well in the future as they did in the past although this time they also have trade groups running ridiculous ads like this washington is full of problems not solutions every time they get involved in a new area of our lives they just seem to make things worse and now politicians are boasting about a plan to control my devices and how i use them their silly ideas could ruin some of the services i rely on if i need directions i simply click one button and it gets me straight to where i need to go in their search for popularity and power dc doesn't care whether they mess up what i need from the internet my message to washington focus on fixing america's real problems and leave my phone alone what is going on with that unsettling man focus on america's real problems like me and whatever my deal is because what is going on with me what's that thing in my truck is it a trash can taped to a desk a jab with a hot barge taped to a chimney also what did i just do to it and why my broader point seems to be that i'd like government to pay less attention to whatever weird that i am definitely up to basically to leave my phone and whatever obviously incriminating is on there alone or i will lunge at you i will lunge right at you washington these companies have pushed some wild arguments from claiming the bills will help china to say they'll somehow hurt people of color and we don't have time to go through every boogeyman that they have come up with but none of them really stand up and some have fallen apart spectacularly apple for instance claims that they have to have exclusive control of the apps you can download otherwise it would expose users to serious security risks ignoring the fact that these bills have explicit carve-outs for that if apple can prove that those risks genuinely exist now as for amazon and google they've been arguing that small businesses would be harmed by these bills funding lobbying groups like this one the connected commerce council which supposedly represents 5 000 small businesses who all oppose antitrust regulation but when politico reached out to its members nearly all of the businesses that they contacted said they'd never heard of the connected commerce council and i do get why amazon in particular wouldn't have filled them in about it because when it directly asked its third party sellers to oppose these bills one of them wrote back any informed seller is going to support massive action taken against amazon in the antitrust arena we are not morons and know how to read and think for ourselves which is basically a polite way of saying you and the spaceship that you rode in on the truth is these bills are narrow arguably too narrow but that is probably why they do have broad bipartisan support both bernie sanders and josh hawley want to pass these bills that's basically the only thing they have in common apart from the fact that both their smiles are exclusively upper teeth no lip so why haven't the bills move forward well some believe that it doesn't help that at least 17 members of congress currently have children who work or have recently worked for four of the biggest tech companies including crucially chuck schumer's daughters one of whom works as a marketing manager at meta and one of whom is a literal registered lobbyist for amazon and the reason that is interesting is because chuck schumer is the person who needs to call these bills to a vote and while he has certainly said that he will do that he also hasn't done it yet and if he doesn't do it before congress leaves for his august recess the bills are probably dead because in the fall everyone's going to have moved on to focusing on the midterm elections where as we all know the democrats will be absolutely annihilated so we have a very small window right now to actually do something about this and if any part of you is thinking who cares things basically work fine for me right now it's just worth remembering people thought that things worked fine with att before they were broken up because they literally did not know what they were missing the problem with letting a few companies control whole sectors of the economy is that it limits what is possible for startups by and if i may quote att's incoherent memo choking them before they can even get started an innovative app or website or product might never get off the ground because it could be surcharged to death buried in search results or ripped off completely these bills would crack the door back open for innovation and nudge the internet back towards what it was supposed to be from the start a revolutionary tool that expands global access to information and the absolute best place to research

Ralph and Bella test 10 pieces of incredible cat technology, including a light-up scratching post, a robot cat ...",Half-Asleep Chris,2024-07-20T16:00:37Z,22,[],PT8M2S,10003177,4246,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet']",True,"This is a Cat Translator,
this is a robot cat-camera,  and this is just plain weird.
That’s right, in this video,  my cats Ralph and Bella are gonna 
test 10 pieces of cat technology,  and see what it’s like to live in the future.
So let’s start with that weird one,  a scratching post.
Yeah, you’re gonna have to trust me on this one.  Other than being a lot taller than 
the ones Ralph and Bella already have,  this looks pretty normal at first glance.
That’s until you plug it in however…  Yep,
it has LEDs inside.  The idea is to create a moving 
pattern for your cat to chase,  sort of like the dot from a laser pen,
and it can even play snake!  I’m not gonna lie, I kinda wanna chase it myself.
Ralph was first on the scene,  and though he immediately seemed to like it,  he was far more interested 
in rolling around frolicking,  whilst Bella sat next to 
me completely uninterested.  Eventually Ralph couldn’t resist a 
scratch awkwardly laying on his side,  before going full-on zoomie-mode.
Still, he remained indifferent to the lights,  and then this happened.
Bella!  You’re supposed to be scratching 
the colourful exciting new one.  She soon made her way over,
and like she does with everything,  ferociously head-butted it.
[Bella purrs]  That’s one very happy Bella.
Like Ralph,  she had a little roll around.
I think it must have been   pre-scented with catnip or something,
and that’s when she noticed the lights.  Finally!
Not that she actually did anything,  aside from just sitting and staring.
Now it’s not fair to judge this only   on the cat’s initial reactions,
so I set up a night vision   camera to see if they used it overnight,
and other than Bella rolling around some more,  and Ralph creepily staring a lot,
they did not. So let’s see if we can get some 
more use out of this second gadget,  a robot camera.  It’s essentially a tiny remote control 
camera that you can drive around,  really useful for checking on your 
cats when you’re not home for example.  Bella was unsurprisingly curious,
and looked adorable sniffing it and   checking it out.
When it moved,  she didn’t seem to mind it as 
long as it didn’t get too close.  But with Ralph,
I knew before I   even showed it to him that he wouldn’t like it,
so didn’t wanna stress him out by driving it,  and as predicted he scampered off upstairs.
As you can clearly see,  the picture quality is far from amazing,
and it kept randomly exclaiming its own   name like a Pokémon.
Robot: Ebo!  It also kept driving around unprompted,
so I really didn’t like having it in the house. Luckily this next camera isn’t for the house,
and doesn’t move round,  it’s a camera bird feeder.
Ralph and Bella go mad for those several   hour long bird videos on YouTube,
so I thought I'd step it   up a notch by creating my own.
Ok this gadget is definitely more for me,  I mean how spectacular is this footage.
It filmed some really sweet birds,  plus this giant round pigeon belly.
But did the cats enjoy it?  It’s hard to say really.
Ralph had just been watching   the birds for real from the catio,
so I’d imagine this seemed somewhat   less impressive in comparison.
He did a big meow,  [Ralph meows]
then left.  Bella was certainly curious,
chirping and chattering away.  [chirps and chatters]
But that was the extent of her interest.  You’re very hard to impress today Bella.
In the past,  they’ve literally jumped up and swiped at the TV,
and Ralph even looked behind it to see if   he could find the birds for real.
Maybe they’ve learnt their lesson,  or perhaps this piece of tech 
is better left to the humans. But how about we try a different animal,  a Remote Control mouse.
This one is pretty self-explanatory,  and the remote is even shaped 
like a block of cheese.  It caught Bella’s attention straight away,
but definitely frightened her   when it scuttled towards her paws.
Meanwhile Ralph had heard the commotion,  and quickly came to investigate,
hunching over and ready to pounce.  He followed it around a little, exploring closer,
before becoming frightened himself,  and watching from the safety of the stairs.
But he couldn’t keep away for long,  this time deciding that friendship 
was the best route to take.  Ah, you’ve knocked it over bud.
Maybe catching mice is not his strong suit. So let’s try one last toy,
this weird feather box contraption  It’s basically whack-a-mole,
with the feathers programmed to stick out,  move around,  and occasionally stop to tease the cat.
Ralph volunteered to go first,  before comically backing away unimpressed.
And Bella, well it gave her a little fright,  so she retreated to a safe 
distance plotting her revenge.  And then the beast was awakened.
[jaunty minor piano music]  The counterattack was short lived,
she got distracted rolling round,  but it gave her a few minutes 
of entertainment at least.  Now some of these so far have just 
been gimmicks where the tech is novel,  but not particularly useful,
but these next few are genuine game changers.  First is an automatic cat feeder,
which I originally bought to dispense   cereal for myself in the Breakfast Train video.
The top section gets filled with cat biscuits,  then you can either use a 
mobile app to trigger it,  or set it to automatically 
release at preset mealtimes.  It’s great for if you’re 
away overnight for instance,  or can’t get home from work 
to feed your cats lunch.  It does admittedly terrify Ralph,
but as long as he’s not nearby when   the food falls he’s fine.
[Ralph meows]  That said, we no longer use it,
in favour of this next gadget. These are microchip feeders.
The food bowl sits underneath a plastic lid,  and holds both dry and wet food,
and these arches have in-built microchip scanners,  each programmed to a different cat.
When it detects in this case Ralph,  it opens and dinner is served.
And then when he’s done,  closes again.
As well as keeping the food fresh and covered,  it’s really important since both cats 
are on separate vet-prescribed diets,  and it stops them from stealing each other’s food.  Also, I love the idea that Ralph and Bella 
obviously don’t understand technology,  so probably think they can 
move objects with their mind. Now all that eating is thirsty work,
but this next gadget has got them covered,  a water fountain.
Ralph’s had a fountain pretty much all his life,  and is something of a water connoisseur.
But this one has a light in it,  how futuristic is that?!
I’m kidding,  the old fountain just needed replacing.  Anyway, I set up the motion-sensored 
camera to see what happened,  feeling like a nature documentarian filming 
a watering hole in the African Savannah.  Bella discovered it first,
satisfied by just a few exploratory sips.  But before long the water 
connoisseur himself arrived,  and demonstrated exactly how he earnt that name.
The camera captured eight separate 30-second   clips over a 15-minute period,
so it looks like he really enjoyed it. Ok, after all that eating and drinking,
they’re definitely gonna need this next gadget,  a robot litter tray. This is a brand new and therefore 
clean one so I can demonstrate,  but we’ve been using this 
model for well over a year now.  When one of the cats has been to the toilet,
motion-sensors detect when they leave,  and shortly afterwards this 
sort of rake comes along,  scooping their business into the end compartment.
Everything then resets,  ready for the next time.
With two cats,  it needs to emptied about every two weeks,  and both the crystal litter 
and lid mean there’s no smell. Alright, let’s talk about something more fun now,
the final gadget of this video and undoubtedly   my favourite,
the Cat Translator.  This is a mobile app that claims to use 
science to translate your cat’s meows.  Now conveniently Ralph has already 
meowed twice in this video,  [Ralph meows]
make that thrice,  so let’s go back and decipher what he was saying.
Apparently this…  [Ralph meows]
means “I’m so mad at you”,  although if I turn the 
volume up, he’s then purring,  [Ralph purrs]
so that’s demonstrably untrue.  Next this…
[Ralph meows]  supposedly means “hello”,
ok?  And finally this…
[Ralph meows]  allegedly means, and this is the weirdest one yet,
“you and I are a bonded pair”.  That’s a very strange thing for a cat to say.
As for Bella, she seldom meows,  so this is the only one I 
actually managed to capture…  [Bella meows]
And it means…  I am so glad you are here.
Yeah, it’s not great.  However,
when I said the Cat Translator   was my favourite thing in this video,
well I wasn’t talking about this one.  I’ve made my own,
and it’s definitely not pretend.  If I hold this near Ralph when he’s meowing,
we’re gonna find out what he really has to say.  I call it:
the Completely Accurate Talking   Translator And Language Knower.
Time to give it a try.  [Ralph meows]
CAT-TALK: Hey Chris.  [Ralph meows]
CAT-TALK: Feed me treats and rub my belly.  Hmmn,
seems accurate.  So there we go,
is technology gonna change Ralph and Bella’s life?  Probably not,
but some of it is certainly gonna   make my life a whole lot easier.
Look at the belly!  Why are you so hairy,
it’s July?!"

awkward Tech fails of all time these are honestly so hard to watch that you're one to bury your head in the ground to save yourself from the cringe so the air umbrella was a pretty exciting prospect when it first surfaced in 2014 it's less bulky than a normal peasant umbrella it doesn't use fabric that needs to dry off it doesn't have a frame that's going to get caught on things and invert itself anytime there's anything more than just a little light Breeze and H you'd look like the coolest kid on the blog repelling rain with your wind force field so am I surprised that this ended up raising over $100,000 when it landed on Kickstarter not really but am I actually shocked that this even ended up on Kickstarter yes because well here's the problem if you actually want to repel rain with air you've got to eject that air faster than the rain is falling at you so 25 mph as discovered by the action lab Channel or in other words this would basically need to be as powerful as a professional leaf blower you know those ones that are so loud you can hear them from two streets away yeah that just right next to your head not to even mention the size of the battery and therefore the weight required to keep this thing running for anything more than 10 minutes and then even if you solve those problems if you're literally blowing the air away from you what happens to the person standing next to you so yeah the product was dead before it was even made and because the trailer was almost definitely faked too by cutting off the image so you couldn't actually see the industrial size pump that I can only assume was attached to actually allow it to work the creators were forced to cancel the project but since they'd already spent all the backer's money on it they had nothing left to refund them with two out of 10 two out of 10 just because things do get much much worse somehow like laundroid a robot straight from the future thought would be able to wash to dry this thing could use AI powered visual processing to identify clothes iron those clothes sort them and then even fold them to be stored in a dedicated closet and this thing was even demoed live at the CES Tech show where it did manage to fold a t-shirt in front of thousands of attendees leading to this campaign being on a whole other scale to the air umbrella I mean this company raised $89 million in funding and then borrowed 20 more for some reason well this is awkward because it's only upon receiving all of these funds that laundroid realized a slight flaw in their plan they were trying to create something requiring the technology of 2050 but actually using the technology of 2015 sure they were able to get it working on under their own very specifically controlled demos but as soon as you took it outside of that yeah I mean like one Verge reporter found that laundroid couldn't even handle folding his T-shirt in 2018 because the black color confused the image processing I mean what would it do if I handled it this but also the vast engineering required to get robotic arms to be able to do what's actually quite a simple task for humans means that this robot was priced at $16,500 who could afford that well only people who could also just hire a maid who could do the job far better and far faster because yes laundroid took between 5 and 10 minutes to fold the most simple t-shirt Peak example of over engineering to ion out a non-issue by vaguely saying the word AI a few times in the earshot of some investors the company went bankrupt about 4 years after they first debuted presumably because they realized how impossible it was to achieve what they were promising because even despite spending over $100 million they did not manage to ship a single unit before they well folded three out of 10 but I got to say one of the best places to experience that raw unrefined Silicon Valley awkwardness is Live Events Tech demos and presentations where things don't go to plan and just watching the chaos that ensues like Apple's iPhone 4 launch event I cannot tell you how much hype there was for this phone it was the first ever major redesign of the iPhone it was the introduction of the retina display but um in the process of showing the audience how much faster and better the iPhone 4 was compared to the previous iPhone 3GS Steve Jobs stumbled into some connectivity issues okay let's just watch the clip it's insanely uncomfortable you want to watch as well so now let me go ahead I'm going to go to some websites I'm going to go to the New York Times today and uh let's just compare these websites so the iPhone 3GS is on the left and it's loading it faster oh no our networks in here are always unpredictable so they're a little have no idea what we're going to find they are slow today you has to keep filling the S you know you could help me out if you're on Wi-Fi if you could just get off I appreciate it uh we're having a little problem here I don't know what's wrong with our networks I can show you some pictures in the camera roll let's just go take a look at some photos here I mean he definitely handled it well considering what was at stake but it's just the whole well a blaming the audience for the iPhone going wrong and then B the well I can show you some pictures and the Ripple effects of a mess up like this they are enormous because all of a sudden there is a caveat to every single piece of coverage that people will make on the iPhone 4 Apple also had an equally big blunder recently with their tra for the 2024 iPad Pro they' basically gone and hired a huge industrial press to slowly crush a myriad of artists tools and I was actually in the crowd watching people live cringing as this press slowly eat the life out of every single object on this platform until finally revealing that all of those things were now compressed into the new iPad Pro and you can see the metaphor that they were trying to go for they really want to portray the wide array of tools that they have for artists like procreate and garage band and how crazy it is that all of them fit into this new ridiculously thin device but the interpretation that a large part of the internet actually took instead was that this is just yet another big tech company very literally crushing the humanity of the individual artist it's them looking at a bunch of sophisticated artist tools the kinds of finely crafted implements and instruments that take a lifetime to master and saying oh yeah that's easy that's simple our shiny new tablet can do all of that I think Hugh Grant puts this really succinctly in a tweet I'm just surprised that not one person with decision-making power Apple saw this ad and thought hey guys aren't people going to take this the wrong way considering the world that we're living in right now anyway they know now cuz the internet's response was vocal enough that Apple actually had to come out and apologize which is a rare occurrence and then almost like clockwork Samsung came out the woodwork to tell everyone how they would never Microsoft's tablet fumble though was even worse they were demoing the brand new Surface RT tablet back in 2012 and you could tell they really really wanted this to be the iPad competitor but then it has access to all of the Windows apps for music for video for Xbox and gaming we can see here I'm running Internet Explorer I can browse smoothly you see great Pages using using clear type and have a great experience just with all the with with browsing it's 10.6 in optically bonded widescreen display custom designed and of course people play games I go play any of the interesting games that are on in the Windows store and I can use surface for using all the sensors that are within Windows as well movies and entertainment look great as well oops hang on what there excuse me just a second surface works great for entertainment as well that is awful it's just the timing the like the little word fumbles when you can tell he's trying to stick to the script but also has no idea what's going on cuz he's looking at the tablet knowing that it doesn't work but not showing the audience poor guy it's a very bad look and in the case of the Surface RT it's unfortunately quite representative of the product itself Windows was first designed for home PCS and this was the very early days of them trying to chop and fit that user interface into running off a touchscreen and a mobile chip the problem was that because this was such a mammoth task early iterations like the Surface RT was so laggy and most apps didn't work the product was bad enough for Microsoft to lose $900 million so I guess you could at least give the guy credit for an accurate demo thank you thank you very much easy 4 out of 10 but if we're going for Pure uncaged secondhand embarrassment you can't beat Volvo in their demo for their new XC60 car in 2010 and its new automatic braking features well feel like a know what's about to [Music] happen oh no I mean technically it ladies and gent we've had some kind of mishap in the testing here we've had some kind of mishap in the testing air you don't say that was the worst one yet the irony that the car's even got a badge saying Volvo Safety Center I mean what better demo could you have had to not buy anything that company makes this must be one of the most catastrophically awkward moments ever at a product launch event but while launch events gone wrong can clearly be pretty amusing the real backfiring only really occurs once the company has officially said it's ready and the product gets out there in the wild like the Apple fine woven cases which were created to replace their old leather option Since cattle farming does create a massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions every year but fine woven which uses a new durable microwill fabric designed to feel sued like while also being largely made from recycled material was supposed to be Apple's way of having their environmentally friendly cake and eating it too moving on from leather without leaving that level of quality behind but my goodness I mean first problem you know this fine woven fabric it might feel pretty thick giving the illusion of the kind of all One Piece cases that we used to from Apple but it's actually just a really thin layer of this material on top of just memory foam okay but then you use this thing a little more and you realize hey it also collects like every single pocket particle that comes near it catur lint dust it's impossible to keep it clean and then the real nail in the coffin is that you then realize it's extremely prone to scratching and also the sides they can just tear and peel if you so much as rub it too hard up against any commonly used case material even really cheap case materials fine woven fair is by far the worst and you could say well it's helping the environment so what if it has to be a bit worse well they're still charging you the full $60 that you would have paid for leather you just are now quite likely to have to replace it for a new one after a year and therefore increase your wastage leakers are now claiming that fine woven was such a poor product that Apple has actually seized production of it going forward now whether or not that's actually true it seems like a pretty smart move to me but you know what wouldn't be a fail is helping us to beat Apple in our year-long subscriber Race So a sub to the channel would be triumphant now if you ever looked for jobs in the professional space there's a pretty good chance that you've heard of a company called glass door glass door is a really Val valuable idea it allows the workers at any company to anonymously share their experience working for their employer which both incentivizes companies to act ethically while also arming future potential employees with information to make better decisions for themselves the key key word in all of this being anonymously because if anyone is leaving bad feedback for a company that they're still currently working at it could be a career ruining move if that feedback isn't Anonymous right well turns out the glassor has decided to change change their policy now any user who signs up needs to give their full name their job title and their employer upon sign up for the purposes of verification which okay kind of defeats the purpose of the whole site since even though your details aren't being attached to your public reviews you can't ever be truly Anonymous if the site actually does hold identifying information about you so weird move but fine until you realize that the website has also been secretly grabbing a lot of older users data too in really creepy ways when one user earlier in 2024 again anonymously going by the Sudan in Monica emailed glassor support team to ask them to remove some stuff that she'd written before what they did instead was to actually take the real name that was in her email and attach it to her public account oh not to mention her City too just in case you know anyone had any doubts about who she was which they must have gotten from her job search locations I guess and the only way to get that data scrubbed delete your account and every single review you've ever left so Monica ended up writing an angry blog post about this it blew up it became a massive Fiasco and we then realized that this had actually been happening to many other people too it all kept snowballing into headlines like if you've left a bad review on glass store you may want to delete your account obviously dealing a pretty shattering blow to both the company's user base and their security reputation they probably should have double glazed it okay the nothing company you know the ones who make these funky transparent looking phones well as a way to try and stand out in 2023 they decided to try and once and for all fix the iPhone Android messaging divide created by iMessage or to put it another way to allow you to get blue bubbles on Android they employed the help of another company called Sunbird who created a system through which users could log into to their Apple ID on their nothing Android phone and from then on their messages could be rooted through an Apple Mac server Farm to come across as official Apple iMessages nothing advertised the feature to include single messaging group chats live typing indic Full Resolution Media sharing voice notes almost the full iMessage shebang at launch and importantly that the messages would be end to-end encrypted so they wouldn't be stored on any servers however literally the day before the November 17th beta launch for this feature Apple announced that they'd finally allow iPhones to support the RCs messaging standard you know the one that Google had been proding them to do for a very long time because it creates parity Androids have RCS so as soon as iPhones have C S2 then it means that Android users while still of course having green bubbles will be able to freely text iPhone users and also have all the perks of modern messaging apps which means that overnight nothing's sole unique offering was now just beautiful new blue bubbles but that's not even why nothing made it on this list because when their app launched on the Play Store people quickly found out that it wasn't end to end encrypted like they promised the app was actually sending all data unencrypted and it could easily be accessed in plain teex the reasons are fairly complicated but one easily relatable and frankly cartoonish example that shows the scale of the problem is that the app was using the HTTP protocol not https any guesses what the S stands for secure nothing weren't actually the developers of the app that would have been way worse they're just the ones who published it but that's still a massive problem for a phone company who needs users to place their trust in them especially a new company with a lot to prove like nothing right it's top five time this is where you just kind of need to grit your teeth and bear the pain now pretty much every Tech fail I've ever covered has some sort of twist like good idea but poor management or greedy CEOs or Shady business practices however in the case of the Humane AI pin yeah it was just a bad idea it was all going really well for the first 8 months or so with the company slowly teasing out details of this device that was the future of Computing Advanced AI capabilities all controlled by touch and voice they got a lot more coverage than you'd expect and a lot more Intrigue than most companies in their position skyrocketing their value to almost a billion dollars it of course helps that both co-founders are ex Apple Executives everyone loves the story of an ex-apple employee doing what Apple wouldn't but let me tell you whilst the resulting AI pin did have the Polish and that unmistakably Apple minimalist design unlike Apple products it feels like in all the hype and the push to devel V something different the company forgot to ask the question why the AI pin did absolutely nothing that your smartphone couldn't already do while still costing as much as a high-end smartphone would with an additional subscription cost that would likely make it even more expensive than your phone which can already do way more I mean technically you can wear it so it's always around but I mean the thing takes so long to respond to your requests it's probably still quicker to actually go to your pocket take out your phone and ask that instead essentially isolated it lots of media slated it and then Marquez MKBHD stepped in to reaffirm that it is in fact the worst tech product he has ever reviewed feels like a 6 out of 10 I think the company will continue to exist but once you've had a hype cycle and this much media attention and then blown it as badly as Humane has it's really hard to get that chance again I think the company will now either be relegated to the specific niche of people who want phones but don't like screens or it's going to have to be bought out by a bigger tech company who can turn the salvageable bits into a better product okay so you remember that glass door section that was all about very poorly handled consumer data well at least that is still currently a what if situation Ashley Madison experienced the worst possible case scenario and by the way I still to this day cannot believe this is a thing but Ashley Madison is the first ever married dating site so you basically only sign up if you're in a committed relationship and looking for some Secret side action boy the tagline is literally life is short have an affair so anyway obviously due to the very sensitive nature of the site it claimed to have excellent security until 2015 when hackers calling themselves the impact team announced that they had acquired every last bit of Ashley Madison's user and employee data and demanded that Avid life media the Canadian company behind the site permanently take down both Ashley Madison and its related site establish men or else they would publicly dump all of this data I mean it's it's hard to have too much sympathy but imagine being one of the 37 million users of this site knowing that at any second your biggest secret could be blown in your life well even more messed up than it already is impact team held a grudge on the site because of how it both trivializes and enables adultery but the other reason they decided to attack the company was one particular feature that Ashley Madison offered you could delete your account but only if you paid them a $20 fee which is slimy enough already but then impact also found out that the company was only deleting that data from the public side of the site they were actually still keeping it internally even while extorting their users to remove it so what happened well Avid life media refused to take the sites down and impact team they were not bluffing they proceeded to flood the internet with post after post 32.8 GB of customer information salary data spreadsheets containing email and password combinations revenue reports source code customer chat logs all topped off with a new revelation keep in mind that the site is a scam with thousands of fake female profiles 90 to 95% of actual users are male chances are your man signed up on the world's biggest Affair site but never actually had one he just tried to if that distinction matters oh goodness well I'm sure that 2015 was an amazing year for divorce lawyers but I me another group who massively benefited from this Scandal is other hackers because people whose data was leaked in this breach have been receiving personalized blackmail emails ever since and even though you're probably not visiting Ashley Madison I'm going to show you a new WhatsApp contact that you can add right now who can just generally stop you falling into traps on the internet and no it's not my mom it's actually bit defender's new AI powered assistant sco this vid's sponsor the concept is this there's like a million cyber criminals out there right but now they're all using AI to mask their scams to the point where Common Sense alone sometimes isn't enough so this is like a completely free companion you add it as a contact or just to your web browser and anytime that you're not sure about something that you see on the internet anytime you're not sure about a link or you know there's emails that could either be something that you need to very urgently action or a way for someone to steal your details all of that stuff you literally just ping it over to sco the same way that you would text your mom except this unlike your mom uses very Advanced AI to tell you what to do and I've actually tried to trick it quite a lot at this point and I have not been successful I've actually been wanting to work with Bit Defender for a while now because they're they're quite good like this is the brand that's trusted by law enforcement globally and they're very highly ranked by independent Labs so scam is a good one for you who's already quite techy but I would say also particularly people you know who are more likely to fall for scams so Link in the description it is completely free now if you thought the crowdfunding air umbrella and the law Droid were bad then xano drones was an absolute shambles this company were promising something pretty incredible a palm-sized drone that did away with fiddly onscreen controls and instead owed you to control it using really intuitive gestures so moving your phone around to move the Drone around and it was apparently so stuffed with highgrade sensors that it could do it all it could follow you it could avoid obstacles it could even lock onto your face to shoot selfie video for up to 15 minutes per charge you want to know how much funding this project got £ 2.3 million it was the most funded Kickstarter project in the history of Europe and unlike the air umbrella which was a bunch of very carefully curated faceless demos the Zano drone campaign seemed to come with loads of real evidence that it was being worked on and real people staking their reputation on it we'll get back to that last bit well the first bit of worrying news was that talking the Welsh company behind the xano drones were actually uncovered to have previously been contracted to develop a military surveillance quadcopter which they failed to deliver on after 3 years of funding because they couldn't figure out the infrared obstacle avoidance Tech which is the same Tech they promised to deliver to the Zano so it still didn't work when people received their xanos they found out that while the obstacle detection function was on all it would do is just fly up in the air a few feet and then land again over and over yeah you know the sky was not the obstacle we were trying to avoid and in the odd times where it didn't just flop around pathetically it would suddenly go out of control flying off in random directions until it was either out of range lost in a tree or embedded in someone's face so Zano didn't even manage to achieve the base function of a drone and then because the kickstarter was so successful that they ended up with 20 times the number of orders they were targeting to fulfill it also means the company smashed all of their stretch goals if you've ever used Kickstarter you'll have seen that sometimes companies will promise extra features if they hit a certain number of orders so yes they had to fulfill all of those too which they were clearly not ready for the company was so strained that they ended up burning through their entire pot of cash to the point where they actually went bankrupt before they could even attempt to integrate many the features shown in the original trailer like gesture control and the Drone being able to land back in your hand wow that actually worked it's like the least awkward thing all video it's actually a bit of a shame that they never got to finish it cuz I would have loved to see the end result of someone holding out their hand and a clearly confused drone accidentally landing on their head but this project got just way out of hand because in order to try and save themselves from bankruptcy the company then started selling the Drone to new buyers before it had even shipped it to the existing backers this project was so poorly handled that it even had a profound effect on Kickstarter themselves with people dropping out left right and center and losing faith in the platform themselves it got to the point where Kickstarter had to send a letter to backers announcing that Zano's creators were banned from creating any further projects and they even went as far as to commission the freelance journalist Mark Harris to do a fullscale investigation basically a postmortem to make it clear to the public that the reason Zano didn't work was because of them and not Kickstarter although let's be honest Kickstarter didn't have nothing to do with it number two then has got to be Fisker an American Automotive Company who released a car called the ocean and this one also involves our buddy Marquez MKBHD so Marquez initially asked Fisker to give him that car so he could review it but the company kept delaying so he just borrowed it from a dealer when fisa found out that Marquez had found a way to get hold of the car they asked him to wait to review it until a software update came out he said no and reviewed it anyway he his words were it's not really in my policy to wait on promised future software updates I'm going to review the car that's out now that real buyers are actually living with and I think this is the important point if this was a pre-released product and it was running beta software then maybe what the company was asking was fair but no this car was on sale and in buyer hands so no taky boxies so anyway marquez's review was pretty resoundingly negative the worst car I've ever reviewed is actually the title talking about a lot of weird choices including unlabeled buttons and sunroof solar panels you can't Monitor and software glitches with the key fob the cameras and more it does not look like a good product I think that's pretty clear but then fisa who's already in a bad spot here made it a lot worse with their response they basically called up the dealer who lent the car to Marquez and asked him for marquez's personal details so they could get in touch directly with him it was a clear sign of a company not confident in their product but in fact scrambling to hide a mess which is not only morally wrong but I mean that would be a crime in some countries Fisco was already on the down before this whole Fiasco but obviously it blowing up across the Internet it's not going to decelerate the process and it made it very much an external embarrassment as well as an internal one to the point where in this moment fisa said that they may not even have enough money to survive the year and they've had to turn to extreme markdowns to Stave off bankruptcy they've basically been forced to slash the price of the ocean their only model by nearly 40% oh yeah and they're also on track for being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for failure to keep their share price above $18 out of 10 fail but now it's getting majorly majorly awkward with Yahoo it sounds ridiculous today but before Google became the absolute Behemoth that it is now Yahoo was the biggest search engine in the world but here's what makes this so cringeworthy Yahoo actually had the chance to buy Google twice the first time was in 1998 where the two Google Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin they wanted to sell their startup so that they could get back to focusing on College which they priced at $1 million and the tech that made them confident enough to price it that high was something called the page rank system it's basically the function that shows you the page that most closely matches what you're looking for essentially what became the core function of Google search yah who decided to not buy the company they said it was overpriced okay but then fast forward to 2002 where Google had already way overtaken Yahoo to be the reigning search engine for a couple of years it was looking so bad for Yahoo that they decided to cut their losses and just go after Google again they swallowed their pride and they offered them $3 billion Google said give us 5 billion and Yahoo thought No 5 billion that's absolutely crazy and they walked away for the second time but oh my goodness you know what Google is worth today 2.1 ion Yahoo could have made a 400 times profit if they'd sealed the deal in 2002 and if they' done it in 1998 well 2 million times but as it stands because they didn't they ended up being crushed by Google with most of their Core Business being acquired by Verizon in 2017 for just a fraction of what it used to be worth 9 out of 10"

वगैरा का प्रयोग करते द अभी बेसिकली चार तो मूड है ट्रांसपोर्टेशन का आप रोड से जा सकते हैं ट्रेन से जा सकते हैं सिप से जा सकते हैं हवाई जहाज से जा सकते हैं हवाई जहाज को सबसे फास्ट माना जाता है लेकिन paanchva मोड अभी ए गया है हाइपरलूप ये हाइपरलूप बहुत तेज स्पीड से चलेगा इसे लूप इसलिए कहा जाता है क्योंकि ये पाइप के अंदर चलता है एक लूप होता है पाइप के अंदर चलता है अब ये समझते हैं इसकी स्पीड कितनी होती है इसमें क्या achchaiyan होंगी क्या खराबी होगी ये वर्क कैसे करता है और इंडिया में यह कब तक आएगा और आएगा तो क्या चेंज देखने को मिलेगा इंडिया में dekhiae किसी भी ट्रांसपोर्ट को अगर आप देखेंगे तो उसके लिए दो सबसे बड़ी बढ़ा होती है एक होता है फ्रिक्शन और दूसरा होता है एयर का ड्रैगन हवाओ का अब जैसे कर वगैरा चलती है तो इसमें देखेंगे तो ज्यादातर तो जमीन का ये फ्रिक्शन होता है ये फ्रिक्शन इतना तेज होता है की ये गाड़ियों को रोक देता है जैसे कहीं पे भी ढलान पे चली गई तो रोक देता है वो ये फ्रिक्शन अब दूसरा होता है एयर ड्राइव हवाओ का झोंका आप dekhiae कर वगैरा ए जाएगी ये समझ में आएगा इसको तो ये एयर ड्राइव है एयर ड्राइव बहुत तेज होता है पेड़ गिरा देता हाथी में देखते होंगे हवाओं का ये क्या गिरा देता है पेड़ गिरा देता है तो ये एयर ड्राइव बहुत ज्यादा हैवी होता है तो यही दो समस्या होती है सब इसी के वजह से किसी भी चीज में फ्यूल ज्यादा खर्च होता है या स्पीड ज्यादा नहीं हो पाती है और अगर स्पीड होती है तो बहुत जल्दी वो चीज रुक जाती है तो इन दोनों चीज को हटाने के लिए लाया गया हाइपर लूप का कॉन्सेप्ट हाइपरलूप में क्या किया जाता है इसमें फ्रिक्शन और ये ड्राइव दोनों को खत्म कर दिया था आपको पता है की कोई भी मैग्नेट होता है उसका एक साउथ पोल होता है एक नॉर्थ पोल होता है अगर एक और साउथ रखेंगे दूसरे को रखेंगे तो ये चिपक जाएगा आदर वाइस मैं ये नहीं chipakega अगर दोनों नॉर्थ नॉर्थ है तो भी नहीं chipakega दोनों साउथ साउथ है तो भी नहीं chipakega एक ही साथ है चिपकने का एक नॉर्थ होना चाहिए एक साउथ तो इसी का कॉन्सेप्ट में क्या किया जाता है जो लूप बनाया जाता है जो लूप मतलब जो ट्यूब बनाया जाता है उसकी जो अंदर की दीवार होती है ये पोलकी बनी होती है मैन लीजिए इसको भी नॉर्थ पोल का बना दिए और इसके अंदर जो पॉन्ड चलता है जो गाड़ी चलेगी इसकी भी ब दीवारों को नॉर्थ बना दिया दोनों को नॉर्थ बना दीजिए ऐसा कर देने से दोनों एक दूसरे को dhakelne लगेंगे और वो chipkenge नहीं एक तरह से कहिए की वो हवा में तारेंगे इससे फायदा ये है की स्पॉट में अगर मैन लीजिए 20 आदमी भी है 20 आदमी तो आप अच्छा खास ये इसका वेट हो जाएगा अब 20 आदमी को धकेल नहीं सकते आप एक चौकी को नहीं धकेल पाएंगे एक खाली कर है jismein कोई नहीं उसको भी नहीं धकेल सकते लेकिन इसमें क्या होगा की ये नीचे की इसकी चारों ओर की जो दीवारें हैं ये लूप जो है वो भी मैग्नेट का है और से पोल से ये भी मैग्नेट का है तो आप इस लूप को ये जो अंदर जो गाड़ी होती है इसके अंदर पोर्ट जो बोलते हैं उसको हल्का सा उठा के लेंगे तो आगे चली जाएगी वहां पर सोचिए कितने हजार क के पॉट को आप अगर हाथ से धक लेंगे तो आगे चला जाएगा लेकिन अगर इसी को हम जमीन पे रख देते जमीन पर आप आते की बोरी जो 50 किलो का उसको हाथ से रखेंगे तो नहीं धकेल पाएगा क्योंकि वहां पे इंस्टाग्राम फिक्सर लग रहा है तो यह फ्रिक्शन को खत्म कर दिया अब एयर ट्रैक को कैसे खत्म किया जाए तो एयर ड्राइव को खत्म करने के लिए वैक्यूम पंप होते हैं जैसे ये पाइप जिस लूप में ये ट्रेन चलती है ना ये देख रही है लूप है इस लूप में जब ट्रेन चलती है तो साइड साइड में बहुत बड़े वैकुंठ पाइप्स लगे होते हैं ये पाइप क्या करते हैं एयर को साफ कर लेते हैं तो जो हवा आगे से काट रही थी उसे क्या कर लेते हैं सब कर लेते हैं तो ये वैक्यूम पंप जो होते हैं सर ये हवा को खींच दिया साहब और मैग्नेट क्या किया ऊपर उछाल दिया तो ना इसके लिए फ्रिक्शन कहा गया और ना ही इसके लिए आप किसी भी तरह का एयर डायग्राम तो इस ट्यूब में अगर आप देखेंगे तो इसमें फ्रिक्शन भी नहीं है और ना ही इसमें एयर ड्राइव है इसके अंदर जो चलते हैं वो पोर्ट पोर्ट चलते हैं पोर्ट जो होता है जो एक छोटा सा कैप्सूल टाइप का होता है इसमें 20 25 आदमी बैठेंगे जितनी इसकी कैपेसिटी होती है ये ट्रेन की तरह नहीं होता है एक-एक बोगी समझ जाइए उसकी तरफ होता है इसके अंदर बैठा जाता है इस बॉडी के अंदर इसके अंदर एयर होता है जिस तरह हवाई जहाज के अंदर ऑक्सीजन होता है ना हवा तो इसके अंदर एयर वगैरा रहेगा इसको अंदर दल के बंद कर दिया जाएगा बंद करेंगे तो हवा तो साथ में चली जाएगी तो बंद करने के बाद इधर जो वैक्यूम पंप लगे हैं वहां से हवा को निकल दिया जाएगा तो बाहर हवा नहीं है लेकिन इसके अंदर जो लोग बैठे हैं उनके लिए हवा है अंदर पर्याप्त हवा रहती है इसके अंदर इसको बंद करके दिया जाएगा उसके बाद रेडी कर दिया जाएगा अंदर का जो डेकोरेशन होता है वो इसी टाइप का देखने को मिलता है अभी सबसे पहले इसे लॉन्च किया जाएगा dekhiae लॉस वेगास में तो अभी स्टार्ट हुआ है ह्यूमन ट्रायल कर लिया गया वर्जिन हाई कर लो के जो द वो उन लोगों ने पहली बार इन्हीं दोनों लोग ने इसका ह्यूमन ट्रायल किया है ये इसका इंटीरियर लुक है ये दुबई में जो लाया जाएगा ये उसका लुक है तो पॉन्ड के अंदर इस तरह से बैठेंगे ट्रेन की तरह नहीं होगा एक बोगी के जैसे होगा वहां पर अब इसमें क्या है इसका मेकैनिज्म क्या कम करता है samjhie ध्यान से इसमें एक लीनियर मोटर होता है लीनियर वाटर इसे आगे ढलता गोल घूमने वाले मोटर जो आप तो जानती है लीनियर मोटर उसे कहते हैं जो किसी चीज को आगे ढलता है तो इसमें एक लीनियर मोटर लगा रहेगा जो इस कंटीन्यूअस आगे क्या करेगा dhakkelte रहेगा फ्रिक्शन है नहीं तेजी से भागेगा लेकिन इसका जो वैक्यूम पंप है जो हवाओं को खींच लिया है लेकिन कुछ ना कुछ हवाओं को वो छोड़ देता है तो इसके लिए क्या किया जाएगा इसके आगे एक फैन लगाया जाएगा वो फैन क्या करेगा आगे से हवाओं को खींच के पीछे की ओर फेंक देगा जिससे क्या होगा वो तेज और चलने लगेगा आप कहेंगे की फैन लगाने से तो bevkufi है रियल में भी दिख रहा है जब वैक्यूम पंप ने पुरी की पुरी एयर को शक कर लिया है लगभग 9596% एयर को शक कर लिया है तो फिर इसका स्पैन का कम क्या है भाई साहब यही ब्रेक का कम करेगा usmein जब कभी भी रोकना है ना तो इसीलिए 100% वैक्यूम नहीं छोड़ा जाता है 90% यह वाला निकाल जाती है 10 परसेंट हवा रखना है की उसी में ब्रेक लगाना है तो आगे भी फैल रहते हैं और पीछे की फैन बातें जब इसे चलना है तो ये ठीक डायरेक्शन में चलते हैं रोकना है तो इसमें तो brekha नहीं क्योंकि इसमें चक्की नहीं रहते हैं चक्कर आएगा तो फिर तो ये तो घर्षण करने लगेगा तो हवा में टर रहा है तो इसी फैन को जब उल्टा घूमते हैं ना तो वो रुकती है वहां पर वो वहां पे रुक जाता है आदर वाइस में रुकेगा ही नहीं तो ये फैन लगाना bevkufi नहीं है वही सब बड़े-बड़े साइंटिस्ट इंजीनियर बनाया है सब bevkufi कैसे करेंगे तो इस हिसाब से ये चलेगा अब इसमें बिजली बहुत ही कम चाहिए क्योंकि फ्रिक्शन है नहीं फ्रिक्शन रहेगा तब ना कंटीन्यूअस मोटर चलाना है addrek है नहीं तो बिजली बहुत कम है अभी आगे जाके जब ये बनाया जाएगा जब ये बांके तैयार होगा तो आप dekhiaega इसकी बिजली अलग से जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी इसी के ऊपर क्या करेंगे लोग सोलर पैनल लगा देंगे क्योंकि ये तो ब्रिज के ऊपर से जाता है तो सोलर पैनल लगा देंगे और उसी सोलर पैनल से दिन के समय डायरेक्ट चला देंगे रात के समय इसकी बैटरी को इससे बैटरी चार्ज करके लगा सकते हैं तो ये काफी फायदेमंद होगा जब ये पुरी तरह से रेडी हो जाएगा तब से जहां तक ले जाना रहेगा ये लूप जाएगा ये लूप जो देखना पाइप की तरह ये पाइप बहुत पतला नहीं रहता है कमरे बराबर होता है पाइप उसके अंदर वो ट्रक एक बस के बराबर पोर्ट जाएगा वहां पर वो उसी के अंदर जाएगा जहां तक आपको ले जाना है आपको ये लेकर ही जाना पड़ेगा इसका कॉन्सेप्ट 200 साल पहले पुराना है जर्मनी ब्रिटेन में इसे पहली बार लगाया गया था जब औद्योगिक क्रांति के समय था लेकिन बाद में वो उतना अच्छा नहीं हो पाया लेकिन इधर जो था उलन मस्क जो है ये टेस्ला कंपनी के मलिक है isape सेक्शन क्या जानते हैं इन्होंने इसको प्रोग्राम को आगे बढ़ाया एलन मस्क ने 2013 में ये कॉन्सेप्ट दुनिया के सामने रखा और इन्होंने अच्छे से समझाया क्योंकि 200 साल पहले जब ब्रिटेन की engineeron ने इसे बनाया था तो उसे समय वैक्यूम पंप वगैरा उतने अच्छे नहीं द लेकिन इन्होंने अच्छे से समझाया और इसके लिए कोई unhen कॉपीराइट वगैरा नहीं कराया इसलिए ओपन सोर्स है आप भी चाहे तो अपने घर बना सकते हैं कोई दिक्कत नहीं है तो इनकी कंपनी बहुत ज्यादा ये ग्रीन फील्ड में इनकी कंपनी बहुत ज्यादा कम करती है सोलर एनर्जी वगैरा में टेस्ला मोटर्स इनका अपना गाड़ी अब अगर चलती है और उसे पर बात इनका स्पेस एक्स जो अंतरिक्ष में हर चीज है इनके लिए एक अलग वीडियो बनाना पड़ेगा भाई साहब ये बहुत महान व्यक्ति इनका क्या कहना है जो मत पूछिए ये युवाओं के लिए एक प्रेरणा है हम लोग के लिए लेकिन वर्जिन हाइपरलूप जो है वो बहुत तेजी से कम कर रही है सिद्धांत इन्होंने दिया ये भी बिजी हैं वीरजी ने एयरलाइंस चलती है यूरोप में unhin क्या है वर्जिन हाइपरलूप इनके पास पैसे ज्यादा है तो ये से कॉन्सेप्ट को ले के बहुत ज्यादा वर्क कर रहे हैं 2014 से ये कम कर रहा है अलग-अलग कंट्रीज में इनके प्रोडक्ट मतलब वर्किंग चालू है ताकि इसे उसे में लाया जा सके इस हाइपर लूप को dekhiae इस हाइपर लूप के कुछ फायदे भी होंगे तो कुछ घाटे भी होंगे तो फायदा हम लोग पहले समझ जाते हैं फायदा ये होगा की इसमें मौसम का कोई असर नहीं पड़ेगा बारिश हो रहा है गर्मी हो रहा है धूप है कोई मतलब नहीं बाहर क्या है कोई मतलब नहीं ये तो पॉट के अंदर चल रहा है अंदर से मौसम में क्या मतलब है दूसरा फायदा है की इससे जीव जंतु कम मरेंगे और ट्रेन से देखते हैं कभी बकरी कट जाएगी कभी गे भैंस हाथी तक टकरा जाते हैं अगर कोई वन्य जीव से निकलती है ट्रेन तो इसमें जीवन की दुर्घटना नहीं होगी पर्यावरण को कोई लॉस नहीं होने वाला है इसे एन कोई धुआं निकलेगा ना कार्बन उत्सर्जन होगा कोई दिक्कत नहीं सामने वाला इससे अनलेस एनर्जी है ऊपर से सोलर से चार्ज होकर नीचे चल जाएगा तो पर्यावरण के लिए एक फ्रेंडली है जो अभी हम लोग पर्यावरण की समस्या को लेकर जूझ रहे हैं उसके लिए बहुत अच्छा है मेंटेनेंस इसमें बहुत कम है ना बराबर है क्योंकि ghisavat है ही नहीं है तो फिर ghisega किस चीज के मेंटेनेंस की सबसे बड़ी समस्या ghisavat के लिए था आपका टायर क्यों घुसता है ghisavat के लिए इंजन में की मोबाइल क्यों डालते हैं ghisavat कम करने के लिए हर जगह तो समस्या girishing वो बिल ghisavat के लिए तो फ्रिक्शन है ही नहीं है तो मेंटेनेंस कम है जब मेंटेनेंस कम है तो इसका किराया बहुत ही कम रहने वाला है और स्पीड तो मजबूत ये भाई साहब 1200 किमी प्रति घंटा जो जहाज ही चलती है हम लोग की कमर्शियल वो 600 किमी प्रति घंटा चलती है तो ये हवाई जहाज से भी तेज चलने वाला है paanchva मोड ऑफ ट्रांसपोर्ट ये है लेकिन हर सिक्के के दो पहलू होते हैं किसी चीज की achchaiyan तो खराबी भी होती है इसकी कुछ खराबी है उसको samjhie पहला की जब आप इसे स्टार्ट kijiega तो शुरुआत में हैवी पैसा देना पड़ेगा क्योंकि इसे हम लोग जमीन पे नहीं ले जाते हैं की जमीन पर ले ही नहीं जा सकते जमीन ऊपर खड़ा होती है तो उसके लिए हमें ब्रिज पे ले जाना पड़ता है तो पहले उसे इन्वेस्टमेंट करना पड़ेगा karodon की खर्च आएगा तो उसके बाद पैसे बहुत कम लगेंगे तो भाई साहब रेलवे में भी bichhane नहीं क्या कम पैसा लगता है रेलवे में भी तक karodon रुपए लगते हैं ट्रैक bichhao ये करो वो करते इसमें एक चीज है इन्वेस्टमेंट दूसरा है इसमें पेड़ बहुत ज्यादा केट जाएंगे क्योंकि इसकी स्पीड इतनी तेज है की इसे बहुत सीधा रखना मजबूरी है अब सीधे में कोई जंगल ए गया पेड़ ए गया काट दो यहां पर तो खैर ये कोई बहुत बड़ा इशू नहीं है अगर आप वहां से काट देते हैं तो इसके अगल-बगल में लगा भी दीजिए सही हो जाएगा यहां पर तो पेड़ को लॉस दूसरा इसमें इसके अंदर प्रेशर बहुत कम रहेगा हालांकि स्पॉट के अंदर प्रेशर रहेगा लेकिन ट्यूब में प्रेशर कम रहेगा तो उससे क्या होगा की जो इंसान ज्यादा सफर करने के आधी नहीं है तो उनको हल्का कान में दर्द वगैरा वो मीटिंग महसूस होगा ये तो जहाज में भी महसूस किया जाता है तो से यहां भी होगा नॉर्मली होता है कोई बहुत ज्यादा रिस्क नहीं होता इसमें समस्या ये है की अगर ब्रेक कम नहीं किया या इमरजेंसी में रोकना हुआ तो ससुरा दिक्कत हो जाएगा इतना तेज स्पीड 1800 kilometer प्रति घंटा इतना तेज स्पीड है जिस वजह से ये क्या होगा बहुत ज्यादा समस्या ए जाएगी आप खुद सोचिए हिंदुस्तान को आर पार कर जाएगा 3 घंटे में कश्मीर से कन्याकुमारी 3 घंटे में 12 * 3 = 36 3 घंटे में आर पार कर जाएगा सोचिए कितना जबरदस्त इसकी स्पीड रहेगी तो ये एक समस्या इसमें बहुत ज्यादा आएगी मतलब इसमें कोई भी सपा आप minuton में कर सकते हैं अगर आपको जाना है मुंबई से पुणे तो जो 3 घंटे लगते द ये उसको तय करेगा 22 मिनट में कट से पहुंचा देगा इसमें एक और समस्या क्या है की इसमें केवल एक पॉइंट जा सकते हैं ट्रेन की तरफ बौद्ध और बोगी जोड़ के लंबा नहीं कर सकते एक-एक पॉइंट जाएगा यानी एक चला गया ना तो उसे रास्ते पे जब दूसरा तब तक नहीं जाएगा जब तक वो पहुंच नहीं जाता है तो एक गया तो फिर अगला आप मैन लीजिए 20 मिनट का रास्ता तो अगला 20 मिनट उसके पीछे जाएगा ये फिलहाल की है लेकिन ऐसा नहीं है जब भी कोई चीज का इनोवेशन होता है आप खुद dekhiae जब पहली मोबाइल आई थी जो जरा इतना बड़ा था लोढ़ा बराबर और आजकल का मोबाइल dekhiae तो ये शुरुआत में भले ये है की एक पॉट है लेकिन आगे जाकर इसमें नए-नए खोज होंगे और ये एक लंबी ट्रेन का रूप ले सकता है किसी को नहीं पता था की एंड्रॉयड और आईफोन इतना तगड़ा मार्केट कब्जा करेंगे सबसे बड़ी समस्या इसमें भूकंप को ले जा रहा है dekhiae जब कभी भी आपकी गाड़ी की स्पीड कम रहती है ना हल्का झटका भी उसको कोई दिक्कत नहीं होता है लेकिन स्पीड ज्यादा होने के बाद थोड़ा सा भी झटका lagaenge तो बहुत तेज मरेंगे स्पीड की वजह से तो इतना तेज ये भाग रहा है usmein हल्का झटका मार देंगे भूकंप से तोड़ के बाहर निकल जाएगा तो इसमें सबसे ज्यादा रिस्क दुर्घटना की है किसी भी वजह से अगर दुर्घटना हुआ तो एरोप्लेन में और हाइपरलूप में स्पीड ज्यादा होने की वजह से इसमें लोगों का बचाना बहुत मुश्किल है लेकिन इतना तो कर ही सकते हैं की एरोप्लेन से ज्यादा सुरक्षित है क्योंकि अगर एरोप्लेन गिरा ना भाई साहब बचने का चांस बहुत कम है ना बराबर है वहां पर लैंडिंग के वक्त फिसल गया तो बच सकते हैं जैसे कोजी कोर्ट मैंने ऊपर किया तो सीधे गए इसमें क्या है की अगर हम पोर्ट को मजबूत बना दे अंदर सीट बेल्ट ज्यादा कर दे तो संभावना एरोप्लेन के तुलना में मरने की इसमें बहुत ही कम है भारत में ये मुंबई से पुणे के बीच में चलने के लिए था वर्जिन हाई लोग इसको बनाने की तैयारी में थी उसे वक्त महाराष्ट्र में देवेंद्र fadnavami जी की सरकार थी इन्होंने इसे अप्रूवल दिया था लेकिन जब सरकार बदल गई uddav ठाकरे साहब की जब सरकार आई तो इसमें इस प्रोग्राम को रोक दिया गया और कहा गया की ये बहुत खर्चीला है इसे किसी अन्य देश में या किसी अन्य स्थान पर ट्रायल किया जाए अगर सक्सेस हो जाएगा तो हम भी ले आते हैं बुलेट ट्रेन भी हमारे यहां ट्रायल तो हुई नहीं थी टाइम मेट्रो हमारे यहां ट्रायल हुई थी ये videshon में ट्रायल हुई तो सक्सेस हम लोग हो गए तो लगे dekhiae हमारा अपना मानना है की भारत को जो बुलेट ट्रेन है ना भाई साहब dekhiae बुलेट ट्रेन जो भारत में लाया जा रहा अच्छी बात है आप लाइए क्योंकि देश में हमारा भी नाम होगा विदेश में जाएंगे तो लेकिन अगर आप गहराई से sochiyega तो इसका बहुत ज्यादा उसे नहीं है रीजन क्या है की बुलेट ट्रेन हमेशा बड़े shahron को होगी गुजरेगी छोटे-मोटे गांव से तो जाएगी नहीं फिर बुलेट रहेगी किस कम के लंबे-लंबे रूट पे जाएगी तो जितने बड़े सर हैं वहां ऑलरेडी हवाई जहाज की फैसिलिटी है वहां पर तो आप जहां से तो जा ही सकते हैं दोनों का किराया से है दोनों की टाइमिंग भी से है जल्दी वही pahunchata है जितने बड़े शहर में बुलेट ट्रेन ले जाएंगे ऑलरेडी मेरे हिसाब से जो भारत की ट्रेन है इसी को टाइम से कर दीजिए भाई साहब अगर ये टिमली निकलने लगेगी तो कोई दिक्कत नहीं हो जाएगा ट्रांसपोर्टेशन अच्छा होना चाहिए सिंपल आपको ट्रेन की बदहाली का एग्जांपल देते हैं की मुगलसराय जो स्टेशन जिसके अभी दीनदयाल उपाध्याय नाम हो गया है तो मुगलसराय स्टेशन से बनारस यानी वाराणसी की स्टेशन के बीच की दूरी में है 15 kilometer है ये 15 किमी 10 मिनट में ट्रेन तय कर सकती है इसे कोई दिक्कत नहीं है लेकिन हर एक ट्रेन को वहां 1 घंटे लगते हैं आप शादुल टाइमिंग dekhiaega नेट पर शादुल टाइमिंग कोई ट्रेन अगर बनारस में 1:00 बजे है तो मुगलसराय वो 2:00 बजे मिलेगी और वहां देर से 2 घंटे लग जाते हैं ये बढ़ा लिए तो हमारी यहां ट्रेन की स्पीड कम नहीं है सूचना मैनेजमेंट खराब है हर साल रेल मंत्री आएंगे इस साल फास्ट ट्रेन चलाया जाएगा 10 ट्रेन चलाया जाएगा ससुरा को वही है कभी सुने हैं की वित्त मंत्री ने कहा की इस साल दो ट्रक की जगह चार ट्रैक किया जाएगा तब ना होगा कंजंक्शन इतना चाहते हैं ये हाल हो जाता है की अगर भारत में किसी भी विद्यार्थी का जो बिहार से चला है दिल्ली एग्जाम देने के लिए अगर कोई ट्रेन कहती है की हान उसे 8:00 बजे सुबह दिल्ली छोड़ेगी और उसे लड़के का शाम 4:00 बजे एग्जाम है ना तो वो लड़का उसे ट्रेन को नहीं पकड़ता है क्योंकि उसको पता है की सुबह 8:00 बजे की ट्रेन की कोई गारंटी नहीं है की वो शाम 4:00 बजे pahunchegi नहीं पहुंचे तो भारत के लिए ये सबसे बड़ी समस्या है ये हमारी ट्रेनिंग इतनी लेट है और रोडवेज का तो पूछिए मत हमारे यहां ज्ञान इतना लगता है ट्रांसपोर्टेशन पे अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति ने एक बार कहा था की अमेरिका की sadken इसलिए अच्छी नहीं है की अमेरिका डिवेलप है बल्कि रियलिटी यह है की अमेरिका डिवेलप ही हुआ इस कारण की वहां की sadken अच्छी है और ये हकीकत है हमारी यहां सदके बहुत खराब है अगर आपको 200 kilometer जाना है ना इंडिया में 200 kilometer तो आपके लिए कम से कम 6 घंटे चाहिए 200 kilometer के लिए लेकिन अगर वही जाना है आपको अमेरिका या यूरोप किसी डिवेलप कंट्री में तो 100 kilometer मतलब एक घंटा हकीकत में 100 किमी मतलब एक घंटा तो भारत में रोडवेज और इनको ज्यादा ध्यान देना बेहतर है आप उत्तर प्रदेश सरकार का एग्जांपल ले लीजिए एक्सप्रेस वे भर दिया उन्होंने चाहे यमुना एक्सप्रेस वो pichhali सरकार को भी dekhiae यमुना एक्सप्रेस हो या ग्रीन फील्ड हो और वर्तमान में भी देख लीजिए पूर्वांचल एक्सप्रेस वे रिंग के एक्सप्रेसवे गंगा एक्सप्रेसवे इतना भर दिया गया है एक्सप्रेस वे को की अभी ये उत्तर प्रदेश से बाकी राज्यों को सीखना चाहिए की ट्रांसपोर्टेशन को बेहतरीन कीजिए आप अच्छे से डिवेलप हो जाएंगे वर्ण कोई नहीं जा पता हम लोगों को पटना जो है पटना से हाजीपुर महज 15 किमी की दूरी है 15 किमी की दूरी को 1 घंटा से पहले कोई तय ही नहीं कर सकता हमारे सामने पटना और हाजीपुर के बीच में जब जाम लगा था तो एक एंबुलेंस में एक आदमी मार गया क्योंकि उसके पास ऑक्सीजन केवल एक घंटे का था और मेरे सामने वो गाड़ी में फंसा हुआ था लगभग 3 घंटे से एंबुलेंस तक निकलने की जगह नहीं होती तो ये सबसे बड़ी समस्या है इसको राज्य सरकार और केंद्र सरकार सबको ध्यान देना चाहिए और भारत में जान की जो समस्या है वो लोगों की bevkufi से भरता है मोटरसाइकिल वाला लेके घुस जाता है चलिए यहां पर अपने को हाइपरलूप समझ लिया हाइपरलूप को समझ गए होंगे बाकी samasyaen धीरे-धीरे सॉल्व होती रहती है samasyaen कभी खत्म नहीं होगी तो आप सुपर लुक का कॉन्सेप्ट समझ गए होंगे दीपावली को आप बहुत अच्छे से बनाए हुए 3 दिन तक हमने भी खूब दीपावली मनाया लोग छोटे-छोटे बच्चों के साथ खूब दीपावली मनाई तीन दिन कंप्लीट ड्रेस लिए लड़कों के साथ हम लिख गेम खेल रहे द फ्री फायर अंबुज जबरदस्त खेले आठ की लिंक

For example, when you play music on your wireless
head-phones, your smartphone transmits around a million 1s and 0s to your headphones every
second using Blue-tooth. These 1s and 0s are assembled into 16-bit
numbers which are used to build the electrical waveform that is sent to the speaker and converted
into sound waves. But how are a million or so 1s and 0s wirelessly
transmitted every single second between your smartphone and your wireless earbuds? In order to answer this question, we’re
going to explore the engineering behind Bluetooth and the principles of wireless commu-nication. Before we get into the details and specifics
of Bluetooth, let’s start with an analogy. When you see a traffic light change color,
you recognize what that color change means. The traffic light uses a section of the electromagnetic
spectrum, or light, to convey information. The green light has a wavelength of around
540 nanometers, yellow around 570 nanometers, and red around 700 nanometers. Your eyes can easily distin-guish between
these different wavelengths of light, and your brain interprets these different wavelengths
and the information they convey. Your smartphone and wireless earbuds communicate
using electromagnetic waves in a rather similar fashion but utilizing a different section
of the spectrum. Specifically, Bluetooth uses waves that are
around 123 millimeters in wavelength. They are invisible to the human eye and can
generally pass-through obstruc-tions like walls, rather like visible light passing through
glass. When your smartphone sends a long string of
binary 1s and 0s to your earbuds, it communicates these 1s and 0s by designating a wavelength
of 121 milli-meters as a 1, and a wavelength of 124 millimeters as a 0, similar to the
540-nanometer green and 700 na-nometer red colors of the traffic light. Your smartphone’s antenna generates these
two wavelengths, and switches back and forth between them at an incredible rate of about
a million times a second. With this pro-cess of switching between the
two wavelengths, kind of like switching between the red and green traffic lights, your smartphone
can communicate around a million 1’s and 0’s every single second to your earbuds. And amazingly, engineers have designed the
antennae and circuitry in your earbuds and smartphone to be attuned to sensing and transmitting
these wavelengths back and forth to one another. Before we dive into further details on Bluetooth,
let’s briefly explore and clarify these visualizations because they’re potentially
rather confusing. First of all, electromagnetic waves do not
travel in a single direction in a sinusoidal fashion like this. In fact, the electromagnetic waves that are
transmitted from your smartphone travel out in all directions like an expanding sphere. When your smartphone switches between frequencies,
it’s as if it were a lightbulb that rapidly changes between two different frequencies
of millimeter length electromagnetic waves, which travel out as expanding spheres. As a result, your smartphone and wireless
headphones can work in any di-rection. Thus, this visualization of a directional
sinusoidal wave is lacking, yet there are still merits to the vis-ualization. In order to give you a sense of how Bluetooth
works, we’re going to use 4 different visualizations that are all different perspectives of looking
at the same invisible thing. Here we have the sinusoid waves which give
us a sense of the frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. What’s moving up and down is not the wave
itself, but rather it’s the strength of the electric field. This perspective just shows us a directional
sliver or ray of the expanding sphere with the electric field going up and down as the
Bluetooth signal propa-gates outwards in all directions. If we were to measure the electric field at
a single point in space, we would find that the strength of the electric field would increase
and decrease sinusoidally, and the number of peaks per second would be the frequency. Furthermore, we’re ignoring the magnetic
field component of the elec-tromagnetic wave, as including it would be too confusing. Let’s move onto the second visualization. Here we have the travelling binary numbers
which give us a sense of the data being sent, however it also doesn’t show the spherical
propagation of the electromagnetic waves or the changing frequency of the wave. Note that it’s possible to send multiple
bits at the same time which we’ll explore later. Third, we have the expanding spheres visualization,
which gives a sense of the true near-omnidirectional emission of electromagnetic waves from your
smartphone and headphones, but it’s difficult to show the frequency or the data that’s
being sent, and it's rather visually complex to process. And last, we have the simplified spheres,
which help us see that these two devices are emitting and receiving electromagnetic waves
along the same frequencies, but it doesn’t show us much else. Different visualizations are useful in different
scenarios, and with that covered, let’s get back to the focus of this video. As mentioned, Bluetooth operates at around
123 millimeters of wavelength, but specifically, it oper-ates between 120.7 millimeters and
124.9 millimeters of wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. Note that, these frequencies are more commonly
referred to as having a 2.4 to 2.4835 Gigahertz frequency band-width or range. Just as our eyes see within a range on the
electromagnetic spectrum, Bluetooth anten-nas see or perceive within their own range of
frequencies . Now, at any given time, there might be dozens of people using Bluetooth
devices at the same time in the same room. To accommodate so many users, this section
of the electromagnetic spectrum is broken up into 79 different sections or channels,
with each chan-nel having a specific wavelength for a 1, and another for a 0 and at any given
moment your Smartphone and earbuds communicate across just one of these channels. For example, these are the frequencies for
a 1 and a 0 in channel 38, whereas these are the frequencies for channel 54. Now this begs the question: if dozens of devices
are using the same wavelengths and possibly the same channel, how do your earbuds receive
long strings of binary bits, or messages from your phone exclusively. Well first, the messages are assembled into
packets. In each packet, the first 72 bits are the
access codes that synchronize your smartphone and earbuds to make sure that it’s your
specific earbuds that receive the message. These access codes are similar to the address
words on a postal letter or package. Just a few lines of writing and a stamp can
send a letter, which is seemingly identical to millions of other letters, to the exact
house or address anywhere in the world. The next 54 bits are the header which provides
details as to the information being sent, which in our analogy can be equated to the
size of the letter or the box. And the last 500 bits are the actual information
or payload, kind of like the contents of our postal letter or box, which in this case are
the digital 1s and 0s that make up the audio that you are listening to. If you’re wondering how audio can be represented
by 1’s and 0’s take a look at this episode on audio codecs. Ok, so now let’s add more complexity to
the mix. As mentioned, Bluetooth operates in a set
of 79 dif-ferent channels. However, when your smartphone and earbuds
communicate, they don’t stick to a single channel, but rather they hop around from channel-to-channel
kinda like channel surfing on your TV. In fact, this hopping between the 79 channels,
which is called frequency hopping spread spectrum, happens 1600 times a second, and after each
hop one packet of information composed of the address, header, and payload, is sent
between your smartphone and earbuds. Your smartphone dictates the sequences of
channels it will hop to, and your earbuds follow along. Furthermore if one of the 79 channels is noisy
due to interference or is crowded with other users, then your smartphone adapts and doesn’t
use that channel until the noise clears. This channel hopping also prevents anyone
from eavesdropping on the information that is being sent between the two devices, because
only your smartphone and earbuds know the sequence of channels that they will communicate
across. Interestingly, because the information is
divided and sent using packets, if your earbuds don’t receive one of the thousands of packets,
it says it didn’t receive that particular one , and your smartphone sends the packet
again. It might seem crazy or mind blowing that the
circuitry in your phone can generate pulses of electro-magnetic waves a million times
a second at very specific frequencies and then have these pulses received and decoded
by your earbuds- but hey- it happens. Just think about how your screen has millions
of pixels, also emitting specific frequencies and strengths of the electromagnetic spectrum,
or light at around 30 to 60 or more times a second. Technology is fascinating. One quick side note: We would greatly appreciate
it if you could take a second to like this video, sub-scribe to the channel, comment
below, and share this video with others. A few seconds of your time can help us to
create many more educational videos. Thank you! Okay, let’s move on. One point of interest is that Bluetooth’s
frequency range of 2.4 Gigahertz to 2.4835 Gigahertz is shared by other industrial and
medical devices. For example, your microwave is in this range
and has a frequency of 2.45 Gigahertz. In fact, when your microwave is on, it can
cause your head-phones to lose track of the 1s and 0s being sent by your smartphone, or
in other words your headphones can lose signal. However please don’t think your Bluetooth
headphones are dangerous because they emit a wavelength that’s similar to your microwave’s. That would be like comparing the light output
from stadium floodlights to the light from your smartphone screen, and saying that, because
they both use the same colors of light, they will both cause damage when stared at from
a foot away. Also, remember we mentioned that the electromagnetic
waves from Bluetooth can easily travel through obstacles such as the walls of your house? However, the walls of the microwave are designed
to block waves of this frequency. You can test this by putting your smartphone
in the microwave; the Bluetooth signal from your smartphone to your headphones will be
blocked, and the connection lost. However, make sure NOT to turn on your microwave
with any electronic devices inside of it, I repeat, do NOT turn on your mi-crowave otherwise
it WILL damage whatever electronics you put into it. In addition to microwave ovens, 2.4 Gigahertz
Wi-Fi networks also operate within this range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Similar to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi networks divide
this range or bandwidth into 14 chan-nels in order to accommodate multiple users communicating
via Wi-Fi at the same time. You might be won-dering, if there are a bunch
of different devices all sharing similar frequencies, one of them being a microwave that, if poorly
shielded, can emit stray electromagnetic waves, how is it possible for your smartphone and
headphones to send megabits of data every second, error free? Well, as mentioned earlier, your smartphone
does this by frequency hopping, and utilizing packets. In addition to that, Bluetooth also utilizes
bits for de-tecting errors and the circuitry in your smartphone filters out unwanted noise. For a non-technical under-standing of this,
let’s go back to our traffic light analogy. When you’re driving and you see a traffic
light, it’s not like that’s the only thing you can see. Your eyes perceive a rather complex scene
filled with tons of other objects. Your brain interprets this information-filled
scene and picks out the information important to you, while ignoring all the objects that
aren’t. Similarly, your smartphone and wireless headphones
have rather complicated circuitry inside a specialized Bluetooth microchip that’s designed
and tested by engineers, which filters out unwanted signals, checks for errors, coordinates
the frequency hopping, and assembles the infor-mation into packets thereby enabling reliable and
secure communication. Before we move onto some higher level-engineering
concepts, we’d like to take a few seconds to thank KIOXIA for sponsoring this video. Many Bluetooth devices such as mobile phones
and tablets use KIOX-IA BiCS Flash Memory. KIOXIA also manufactures a wide variety of
SSDs and they have sponsored a couple of our videos that explore the inner workings behind
how SSDs work. Here’s a consumer class SSD, versus this
enterprise class SSD. They look similar from the outside but are
entirely different on the inside. KIOXIA pro-vides these leading quality enterprise
class PCIe NVMe solid state drives, and they can fit in the same space, but have capacities
up to a whopping 30 Terabytes, and use a proprietary architecture built with their own controller,
firmware, and BiCS Flash 3D TLC memory in order to deliver incredibly high sustained
read and write performance and reliability. Check out KIOXIA’s SSDs using the link in
the description. Let’s move on to even more complicated details
regarding Bluetooth. The scheme of sending a digital signal, or
a binary set of 1’s and 0’s by transmitting different frequencies of electromagnetic waves
is called frequency shift keying. Frequency shifting means that we adjust the
frequency, and keying means that a 1 is assigned to one frequency, and a 0 to another, just
like our traffic light colors. Note that the comparison to a traffic light
which emits one color and then another is a little inaccurate because your smartphone’s
circuitry generates one frequency, called a carrier wave. This circuitry shifts the carrier wave to
a higher frequency when it wants to send a 1 or to a lower frequency when it wants to
send a 0. This shifting of frequencies in order to send
information is also called frequency modulation, and it’s closely related to FM radio. That being said, Bluetooth isn’t limited
to using just frequency shift keying; but rather it can also use other properties of
electromagnetic waves to transmit information. A different method that has higher data transfer
rates is called phase shift keying, which is a significantly more complicated to explain
but we’ll try. An electromagnetic wave’s phase is a property
that our eyes can’t perceive, and it shouldn’t be confused with the amplitude or the frequency
or the wavelength. Let’s use an analogy. Imagine you’re at the beach and you see
the waves hitting the shore at a rate of one wave a second. Over a minute you would see 60 wave peaks
reach and break on the shoreline. Changing the frequency would be changing how
many wave peaks reach the shoreline every second and changing the amplitude would be
changing the height of the peaks and troughs of the waves. However, phase shifting would be seen as breaking
up the waves’ locations of the peaks and the troughs within a set of wavelengths. There are still 60 waves over an entire minute,
meaning the frequency doesn’t change, but as the phase shifts, it’s as if the peaks
and troughs shift forward or backward within a set of wavelengths. Bluetooth antennas and circuitry in your smartphone
and wireless earbuds can be designed to emit and detect shifts in the phase of an electromagnetic
wave, and binary values can be keyed, or assigned to dif-ferent levels of shifts in the phase
of the wave. There are a few things to note with our examples
and explanations. We’ve talked a lot about your smartphone
sending information to your wireless earbuds; however, your earbuds also send data to your
smartphone. For example, when you’re on a phone call
using your earbuds, the audio from the microphone in your wireless headphones is obviously sent
back to your smartphone. In order for Bluetooth to accommo-date this
back-and-forth conversation, the smartphone and the headphones alternate transmitting
and re-ceiving data, while maintaining the frequency hopping schedule. During one 625 microsecond timeslot, your
smartphone will send one packet of data to your headphones along one channel, and then
during the next 625 microsecond time slot your headphones will send one packet of data
to your smartphone along the next channel in the frequency hopping schedule. Also, as we mentioned earlier, a Bluetooth
packet is composed of 3 sections: access codes of 72 bits, a header of 54 bits, and for example
a payload of 500 bits. The number of bits in the access codes and
header are pretty close to those mentioned, however the size of the payload which is specified
using the header can vary widely between 136 bits and 8168 bits depending on the requirements
of the data being sent. For exam-ple, simple commands from your headphones
like pause or play the music would require far fewer bits than sending or receiving high
quality audio. An additional caveat is that the electromagnetic
waves sent and received from the antenna in your smartphone and earbuds, and the light
from a traffic light, share the aspect that they both function within the electromagnetic
spectrum. However, the principles that govern how your
smartphone and headphones gen-erate and receive those electromagnetic waves are quite different
from the principles around how traffic lights and your eyes work. It’s kind of like how fire and an electric
radiator both generate heat but using vast-ly different methods. The principles behind Bluetooth fall under
the category of antenna theory and will be explored in a separate episode. Thus far we’ve made a few episodes that
help to explain other parts of these wireless headphones such as noise cancellation and
the audio codec, and we’ve made even more episodes that dive into the dif-ferent parts
of your smartphone. Check them out to learn about these other
fascinating technologies. We believe the future will require a strong

like the best games at like 4k I have a monitor. I just need a PC My budget is a hundred seventy thousand dollars Taiwan dollars, of course But I want something that looks really cool. Like can you build
this? Can you build that? You built it? I was worried there could be a language barrier with
the shopkeeper, but as it turned out, not only was his English great, but he said
he's the one who built those demo systems. Step two, play dumb. I've always believed that our
character is determined not by how we treat our peers, but by how we treat those who might be
in a vulnerable position. So I'm not going to be flexing any of my tech knowledge here. How does it work? I don't know what parts I want. I just know I
want something that can game at 4k, um, like really really fast. Like, like uh, with um, like I, yeah, like I don't want like the one with the floppy tubes
though. Yeah, like if someone come, do I like what? Ironman. Sure, yeah,
yeah, sure. I built an Ironman and a cyberpunk before. Oh cool, okay. I don't need it to have like a special theme or anything though
just like like honestly just like a nice clean look like that is pretty good
but can I get it by Friday? This Friday? Yeah. Yeah I think so. You think you can do by Friday? Yeah I think so. Okay. I can give you a menu of like menu of what I use inside. Oh I mean yeah sure I don't know any of that though so you just got to tell me you got to tell me what's good for that price. Okay. Yeah I'm trusting you. Okay. Okay. I'll again go around I'll just send you a picture and the menu and price. Okay. How about that? Okay. Okay. Oh that's perfect okay sorry it was *name* right? Yeah. Okay nice to meet you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, well that went pretty smoothly I think. So I'm committing to just handing over the money regardless of what quotation comes back. Let's see if they give me a good deal or rip me off. Oh, buddy got back to me. Do I like white or black? I think I like white. It is mind blowing to me that we don't do more of this back home. He's just like, yeah, what's your number? Can I just text you? Boom, sends me a gallery of systems. Like, yeah, how do you want it? White or black? What's your vibe? It's great. It feels so personal. He asked what brands I like. I don't know what brand is good. Just trusting you to put together the best system that looks like you said, f***ing awesome. Man, he keeps wanting to ask me he's like, do you want AMD Intel? I'm like, which one should I get? You tell me man. Let's go. Give me a good system. Step three, payment. I was legitimately pretty stressed at this point. I don't have any idea what my work credit card limit is. And accounting is not gonna be impressed when I hand them a receipt for some computer in some foreign currency with no tangible asset to show for it. What, I'm gonna carry this thing home with me? I'm gonna have to find someone to give this thing away to before I leave. But that's a problem for another day. Just got the quote, time to pay my deposit on what I think is gonna be a pretty sick system. Okay let's see if my card works. When I finish I'll write you a ticket and then... Great and then I can come pick up Friday? Yeah. Perfect. All right, yep should be good. Great. Okay great. So
you'll message me on Thursday or Friday? Yeah. Okay perfect. Thank you very much. Success eventually. Shout
out bank one for the you know fraud detection. This random 5,000 US dollar transaction overseas
and I guess also shout out bank two for having my back and making sure my money can be spent.
Ended up using that card. Sorry accounting department. We'll get it reconciled. Now we play
the waiting game. I can't believe it. Let me just tap a card. I didn't even have to
enter my PIN. Just like scribble on a touch screen for my signature and poof
money gone. Let's see what I get in return. I wouldn't blame you for thinking. Does the world really need another handheld gaming PC at this point? Here it is, my friends. Concrete proof that satire is dead. I think you can take notes faster than that. Like the speedy segue. To our sponsor! Who's laughing now, Colton? Woo! Woo! Well, he says it's ready. Good luck, everybody. Can't believe he finished in three days. I don't know what this is, sorry. It's a computer. Oh, we spent five grand on a computer. U.S. U.S.? The best part is we have absolutely no way of transporting this thing home, so we're gonna have to like give it away or something. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right, well that's probably fine. Oh. Hi. Just picking up the system. Okay. Wow. That looks awesome. Wow, hold on, I wanna get a picture of it. So you did like a thermal test already? Yep. Awesome. I guess I should have asked this before is there some
warranty on the system or how like how if I have a problem with it Can you guys fix it? Yeah for how long? One year, okay, great Three, four years you can still find me.
Oh, okay. Hmm. I came here on the bus. Good luck. Yeah Its about 40K.
Wow, okay, how many computers do you guys build every day? About five.
Wow, okay. Wow busy Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good doing business with you.
Thank you. I will I didn't have any problems. It's slimy. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. You know, I gotta say, other than the lack of a, you know, I don't know, cart or something to carry the system out of here, that's about as boutique an experience as I could have expected. I mean, he had it running a test suite and everything right when I walked in the door so I could see everything running, including thermal testing. It's all packed up nicely. He gave me all my accessories. He seemed confused by the fact that I wanted a receipt for such an
expensive purchase, but other than that, pretty good experience. I want to know, is this system so custom, that if he didn't give
you a receipt, you would still know how to work with it, or is that it? Uh, I mean, he's only been at that location, he said, for seven
months, so I don't know how they would have known. Do they just take people's word for it? The level of trust seems pretty high. I mean, he doesn't even leave
his store supervised, so... Why did I choose to shop on the fifth floor? I don't know. This is very reminiscent of our early days, though. Are you following you around a tech hall or tech spot? Are you
calling weird stuff? I thought you meant the early days of the channel, and I was going
to say, yeah, it was fun doing a video like this. It's so hard these days, because, like, a lot of the time people
recognize me. I wasn't sure if he was going to know LTT. It's possible he did, but he just has a good poker face, I'm not
sure, because I did kind of seem like a real idiot. No, I don't know what Intel is, you know? If I was anywhere other than Taipei, I would not want to ride a bus
with this thing. But we're not, are we? Okay, so he said he builds four to five systems a day. Wow. Does that seem about right? In the shop, yeah, probably I mean looking at how much inventory
that you're carrying probably not systems like this But okay, then why were you surprised by three days? Because I thought he might have to wait for you know water blocks
to come in stock and stuff like that like there's a lot Of specialized parts in here. I Didn't think he'd necessarily have a 4090 on hand small shops back
home stock almost nothing when it comes to high-end hardware I mean look at the stuff. We cleared out of Keith's shop Oh, yeah, I think you guys are gonna be pretty impressed when we
have a look at how this stacks up to that Main Gear system Finally, let's have a look at what we got. Haven't done an unboxing in a long time. I'm rusty. No, no, I don't need help. I got this. Dang it. No, I'm not gonna break it. I'm not gonna break it. Okay. Oh, right, I forgot to mention, really good packaging, by the way. It's double boxed and uses a really, really nice closed sell foam. Even though this system is probably too heavy for the packaging, if it was a more reasonable one, I think it would survive shipping pretty well. Not that they would normally ship the systems to the customer at a store like that. It occurs to me, I don't know what the store is called. Oh, not bad. Wow. Those U-bends though. Okay, buddy's got skills. Let's get this side panel off. This is so flipping clean. It wasn't that long ago that Bykski would have been considered a budget tier water cooling brand, but I gotta say, they do not look out of place in this system. And the craftsmanship of these bends is just. Outstanding, this length right here is the hardest one to nail
because this one or this one. Well, you can always do the bend and then make slight adjustments
to it after the fact. This one right here, you can't adjust and he's got it perfectly
parallel to the rest of the case. That is awesome. You know, I'm looking for flaws here and I just I can't find them. When an ignorant customer gives you a budget, you could just. Not bother buying a vertical GPU mount. You could just pocket the difference. You could not bother putting in the extra work of grabbing a reverse direction fan so that from the inside, you know, all the hubs are facing in, but they put in the work. Okay. Maybe the backside, maybe the cable management sucks. Let's have a look. Not bad. Not bad at all. Oh, I found a flaw. Andy. Ah, he's an Andy man. The peels are still on. Okay, not a flaw for my camera operator. He's into that. I like peels removed. No, keep that. No, no. And while we're back here, we've got a Seasonic Vertex 1200 watt fully modular power supply. Multiple opportunities to cheap out there, chose not to. All right, time to fire it up. How convenient is it that our hotel has a little gaming room? Look at this. Why don't you put English windows on it? Yeah, maybe. Let's hope. You ready? Big moment. Wow Wow, buddy When the instruction is make it look F*** awesome and you deliver this You followed the instructions. This looks great And I'm just admiring again how parallel these tubes are this one
coming off the reservoir is Perfectly aligned with the one coming off the GPU which again he
had to spend extra in order to achieve to put in these spacers I can't find a cut corner at least not yet. What about the spec?
Maybe main gear comes out ahead there Conveniently we can check that with the preloaded ida64 extreme.
Very nice It's a trial version, which is technically not what you're supposed
to do. But let's have a look at the specs here. Oh my god Andy Main gear just got taken for a f**king walk They had a core i5 right? This has a 7950 x3d top chip on the market Okay, they had a 4080 super which is pretty okay 4090 they had 16 gigs of ram. I'm looking at wait, wait, wait,
wait, hold on. Oh, I don't know. How about 64? What do we got for storage? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, dude. They had 512 gigs of storage This has 8 times that amount. Okay. It was a little sloppy leaving
my uninitialized drive That's not great. It's a lot better than not having it How are we doing for bloatware though? Aida64, Ryzen master Furmark obviously those are not part of a bare windows install, but
I don't consider them malicious in any way So i'm okay with that msi center and video track. Yeah, i'm the one
who put obs on it Nothing Zero bloatware. I feel like this is too good to be true though. No
one can be perfect Oh, I got something. Expo is not enabled and my RAM is running at
3600 mega transfers per second. That is very slow for a Ryzen system. Let's
see if we can turn it on. To his credit though, that's a nice up-to-date BIOS.
Love to see that. Okay, moment of truth. Did he validate Expo and maybe it just
reset? We're gonna find out. Does that basically CPU block have a coolant
temperature? LCD on it? Three hours later. No post. Oh wait, wait! It changed. The code changed from 15 to 64. Oh. The good news is the fix should
be as simple as removing half of the memory, still giving me twice as much as my
main gear would have had as long as I can actually get it out. The water
tubes are a little bit in the way. Still no dice. But I do have an idea. It's been a long time since I've seen this
really matter, but I noticed that my two dual channel kits, you can tell from the
serial numbers, are separated. So here's the two I pulled out before, which were in a dual channel
pair, and here's the one I pulled out just now. 1010. That's a kit. And the one that's in there in this one are another kit. Usually doesn't make that big of a difference, but if the sticks
have different ICs on them, it can cause compatibility issues, especially running at maximum speed. Wait. No way. Was that it? Dude. Okay, I haven't seen that in years. That's like ancient troubleshooting from the dark times. 5600 mega transfers. That's it. It's such a simple error. You open up two kits, you just have all four sticks, you put them in in any order, and... 50/50 chance. You get it wrong. Let's put the other two back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's put the other two back. Let's see. I'm gonna give it one more chance, and then I'm gonna pull those
two sticks, and we're gonna call it 32 gigs. Yeah. Well, there you have it. It wouldn't be an LTT video without a
little bit of troubleshooting, and I still consider it a win for the system configuration, but I'm not super thrilled about my memory running at 3600
megatransfers per second by default. And needing to spend a bunch of time moving memory sticks around in
order to get 5600. Which, on this platform, would result in a measurable performance
difference. Hmm, I just noticed Google Chrome was pre-installed too. It's one of the first things that I install, so I just didn't
really register it, but... Questionable. While this is some stress tests, why don't we have a look at how
the shop handled all of our included accessories? Okay, good. Power cable in a pretty obvious spot right here. All
manuals included, extra cables included for our power supply. Pretty much as expected. GPUs don't come with much in the way of
accessories these days, but the reason I want to open this one up is I want to see what he did
with the stock cooler because that card is not water cooled by default. This is S
tier. This is exactly what I would do if I was taking the time to do it
myself. He pulled out every screw, obviously, to get the block on, and he put every screw back in where it goes. So putting this card back together is as simple as undoing it, remembering everything, putting the PCB back in the middle, and doing it all back up. If there's one thing that I could criticize, it's that maybe I would cover up this thermal paste so it doesn't get goop on my hands when I'm trying to handle it in the future. That's really such a nitpick, though. This is really good. There's my two kits of memory, one of which works at a time. Legit Windows 11, can't take that for granted in smaller shops, but there it is right there. It's worth noting that we did find some minor errors, but I'm still extremely happy for the price. Buddy was extremely responsive, and the customer service was maybe too much. He messaged me at 2.30 in the morning last night, being like, ""Did you set it up?"" It's a fair assumption that someone who just bought a $5,000 gaming
PC is probably up all night playing on it, but maybe not at 2:30 in the morning next time. Still, it's cool to have that personalized touch, and I genuinely
felt like he just wanted to know if I loved this system. Let's go find out if we love it. Not bad. 10 minutes of FurMark and Prime95 blend. Nothing has crashed, and the hotspot on this GPU is under 70
degrees. And, okay, it doesn't get that Quiet at idle. But it isn't any louder under load, so I consider this extremely acceptable. Let's fire up a real game. Casual 350 FPS at 4K, anyone? Sure, why not? Well, it works great. I think it's time for us to take this out and find somebody to give it to. We're gonna keep it simple. The first person who walks up and says hi, they get a computer. Mainly, I just don't wanna carry it for very long. Maybe I'll walk to the bakery I like. I feel ridiculous. If we were at the show floor, we'd probably have better luck. Hello? Sorry? Are you Linus? I don't know how to pronounce it Yeah, hi! I love your videos! It's an honor to meet you Oh cool, so it's your lucky day Yes, it's very lucky for me No no no, you don't know though You don't know why it's your lucky day Because I'm giving that computer to the first person who recognizes me on the street I don't know what to say, I'm in shock, thank you. Is this real? Yeah. You might need to get an Uber or a taxi or something. I can give you some cash to take a cab 'cause I think your bike is gonna be not able to carry it. All the accessories are in there, all the cables and everything like that. Congratulations. Enjoy your computer. Thank you so much. And enjoy this segue to my sponsor.

in the next 5 minutes buying the most indestructible Tech in the world and then we're going to compare it to normal Tech to find out just how much it can withstand so I guess we might as well start with the laptop oh my God this thing looks like a beast oh it's not cheap I guess if you want a rugged laptop you can either buy a rugged laptop or you can buy a very rugged case for your laptop and that's $80 we can get both and compare them okay Ultra durable Smartwatch so you obviously have the Apple watch Ultra 2 oh we should get one of the ultra 2os and then we should compare that directly with the durability of the Bas level Apple watch in theory durability should be the main reason for paying twice as much money and then you've got the Guard Pro Ultra 2 plus does say though that it's sturdier than all competitors you know how much of a sucker I am for the internal desire to prove claims wrong ah and we also have to accompany that with the most durable phone you got black view oh those bezels are horrendous it seems like on most lists though it's Nokia that tops it we could get this the the new Nokia but then we could also get the old Nokia you know like the 3310 the original brick compare those two to see how much durability has evolved over the years that's that's a fun idea oh yeah in all of these videos I love to get a keyboard in that theme so what can we get for the most durable what maltron single hand keyboard it looks like it'll take about five hands to use wo that looks like like a tank so this is the all right I found what I think is the best one but $600 I am very curious how much stronger that can be versus just the $10 keyboard you get from Amazon ah how are we going to charge all of our most durable gadgets with the most durable cable of course we need to find something that's like proper industrial grade oh Cy this one's made with Kevlar does like the same material that's used for bulletproof vests oh this one looks like it could take some damage oh it actually says the these cables are also made from indestructible materials well then you sir have earned yourself a space on this video you may live to regret that comment the same website also has a power brick SL light baked into one indestructible package Ah that's something I didn't think about like an incredibly durable incredibly waterproof camera we can present the testing section underwater please help me you're too much ring apparently someone's come up with an indestructible TV wait what are you doing this is hard to what would you look at that Ultra tough SD cards that would actually solve a real problem that we have constantly snapping them okay I just want to find the most random indestructible Tech ah yes the indestructible dog chew toy for aggressive chewers says here indestructible puffer 15 times stronger than steel build to keep you warm down to -30° cus 30 okay sure why not there's even an indestructible fan I'd guess it's designed for construction sites oh they got a Tik Tok video wao okay it feels like some sort of like rights violation is from the company Big Ass Fans ah so we've spent all this time looking for indestructible gadgets right well this the Pelican air is basically saying whatever you put inside of it it in itself is such a durable carry case that that thing inside becomes indestructible someone's actually made an indestructible coffee maker play coffee is an [Music] essential DeWall makes a speaker you know that if they've made a speaker they've done their due [Music] diligence okay um there's actually no one here to take the laptop away for me so I'm going to have to self discipline myself but yeah let's uh skip to when the products arrive everything is finally here I've got my tools of Destruction and 17 unlucky products that are about to face them so let's go roughly for least expensive to most expensive first up being our rugged cable which the website labels as the strongest and fastest charging cable on the planet an absolutely outrageous claim that we have to confirm ourselves well it certainly feels like a cable that could take some damage so let's just go to the extreme end with it this is a 1,000 kg car can you tow it with one of them now obviously no one is ever going to actually need to do this but if the cable can take this it says a lot about its ability to take General wear and tear 3 2 one that did not work that did not work at all I think we lost a piece of the car oh yeah and the cable is absolutely wrecked yes this was a tough test but if you call yourself unbreakable you are kind of asking for it 4 out of 10 and from the same company at $87 the camping light and this is going to help us answer a question that I've always wondered about it's a really common thing in the tech world to see something that's shock proof or impact resistant but unlike what a that was close but unlike water or dust resistance which are pretty clear what does shockproof mean like is that a shock ow is this a shock oh okay still works but don't worry we have actually gone and hired a full-on not so secure feeling Boom Lift so that we can find out exactly how drop resistant this stuff actually is so let start with a 5 m drop so a lot higher than it seems 3 2 1 that felt like it did nothing 5 m onto a concrete surface is a very significant drop but look light is on it's barely even marked I can't even get myself to stand up straight 3 2 1 oh there we go that was it okay so the frame is cracked the top is separated does it still function no circuit board's gone as well game over for the rugged a very respectable showing though 9 out of 10 and while we're here we might as well also see how our DeWalt speak aairs okay so how does it sound ooh not bad at all it's only coming from One Direction but providing you're at that direction you're having a good time with this it's very full sound and really detailed too a 10 m drop onto pure concrete would be enough to end almost All Electronics come on DWT I believe in you let's see if the Music [Music] [Applause] Stops I guess that's why they have detachable batteries okay so technically the music did stop but we need to work out if that's because the battery separated or because it's actually dead the physical damage on the speaker really doesn't look too bad and it does indeed power on well done very very cool that's a strong 9 out of 10 product 10 out of 10 if it had surround sound but if you think that was durable then I don't think I've ever even seen claims like the ones that this next product makes a notebook but fit to withstand an alien invasion by the looks of it so this right here is a reinforced carbon fiber cover which to be fair you might have seen before but the most shocking bit is the pages these are not paper or cardboard or any variant of it this is pressed Limestone so let me do a little Doodle on this first page and then let's say I decide actually I hate that what Okay so it's not completely tear proof If you're trying but it's definitely safe to say it's tear resistant you have to put a lot of effort into do that oh and a sub to the channel would be well not terrible okay so tear resistance check but what about all weather conditions wait so if I just like Pat it dry no way the drawing is completely unchanged the paper looks completely intact even while both the pen and the paper are absolutely drenched I can still carry on drawing I mean just for a point of reference this is what happens with a normal notebook when you wet it poor Smiley it claims to be oilproof which I mean yeah my fingers are not showing up at all but to be fair what if we just did this what if you're just cooking your Italian food and you accidentally spill it okay so this right now looks like a crime scene but wipe and the page is completely usable oh God table's starting to feel like an Italian Kitchen actually [Music] I apologize for what is about to happen little salt little pepper this might be the first time anyone has ever tried to cook their notebook wo not fireproof so the binder and the outer cover completely fireproof Pages not so much should probably stop breathing that in I'm a little disappointed cuz it did specifically say that it was fire resistant that put up no resistance to fire but hey at least it did survive the most important categories no one's actually going to blow torch their notebook 6 out of 10 but as we go higher on the price list things are about to get even more advanced so these are the earphones that allow you to listen to music underwater if this works the way I think it works it's going to allow me to experience something I've never experienced before and actually to show it we're also going to need to whip out another one of our products the Olympus Tough tg7 the and I promise I'm not making this up the actual Never Going To Give You Up camera oh and then we compare that with the Sony tough SD card oh the synergies here giving me tingles and this might actually tangibly improve all of our lives here cuz we have gotten through our fair share of SD cards it really doesn't take much so this is a single piece resin molded design that's trying to essentially remove every single one of the vulnerabilities or a normal SD card like the seam in between each half the connector ribs the right protect switch and as a result it's apparently 18 times stronger than a normal SD card so both of these are loaded with top secret files this is a bowl of water blueberries ginger ale don't ask me what cocktail I'm making here do it as well and then I'm just going to leave that for 10 minutes a few minutes later right let's see if well either of these still work start with the ultra tough SD card oh straight away it shows up let's just make sure it loads properly I love how the SD card is just called tough oh yes there's a good reason why these files are confidential okay so that works although it might not after that ejection let's try the normal SD card oh it's not loaded anything just a bit of Ginger oil no that is actually dead so that already justifies the existence of this tough SD card but I have a sneakier idea an idea that can work out the true break resistance of this new SD card the door slam like I've had a nightmare about this exact situation 3 2 1 oh okay so the tape is completely uprooted there's clearly like a hairline fracture on the SD card itself so if we put it inside of our camera card error I think we might have killed it so these SD cards are absolutely tough but they're not invincible so we'll just stick one of our normal peasant SD cards into this camera go for a swim oh wow it's very cool that this camera double locks itself for maximum waterproofing now just before I make the jump earphones because as well as the normal issue of waterproofing the design and making sure the sound stays intact and also just stopping the earphones floating away there's a bigger problem that has prevented most Bluetooth earphones from working underwater range while Bluetooth in the air might have a range of like 30 ft because it's a very low power connection it does not fight through water molecules very well so that 30t range in a swimming pool could well become like 4 in so to address that these zygo earphones have a radio receiver and an app that basically allows your phone to broadcast via much more powerful radio waves okay let's hit record on this camera there you go now I can definitely buy that this is completely waterproof by the way they've got this custom proprietary charging pin connector when I put it on yep that's not going to float away so it solves that problem and then as far as the sound being transmitted in the water it's bone conduction which is why it's got such a clamping force on the sides of my head but now it's time to test the big question is it going to actually carry on playing even as I jump into the water so the radio waves really work [Music] it works it [Music] works the sound quality is not the best it just sounds like everything is quite far from your ears but can't do out with airpods 8 out of 10 okay so waterproofing we've established this has but it also claims to be freeze prooof so this is some very real dry ice that is genuinely as cold as - 80° C which is absolutely Bonkers look how quickly it turns to gas just as it meets the air which is already pretty cold as it is you eat one of these you're in for a very bad evening so I've hit record just in case this survives I have some doubts and now and you go my temperature sens are saying it's off the scale this doesn't even go past -3° C I can see the temperature of the camera itself falling if you're still alive down there I am very impressed Well Done Right that is 10 minutes the camera has reached below -20° C which is well out of operating range now the question is is it still recording the camera feed is still going look at the screen that is absolutely Wild and the wrist strap everything from the screen to the lens is completely frozen over the camera still lives at heart which means I mean a 10 out of 10 products but also B there's a very specific way we can test this further but it will need a product from later in this video weird kind of day today but now feels like a pretty good time for a coffee break so this is our Makita coffee maker designed for a delicious Brew even in the absolute harshest conditions and is it just me or does this look an awful lot like a video game prop so we're talking things like a cup that almost locks itself in place inside of the machine allowing coffee to come in whilst also insulating it and keeping all dirt out as well as boil dry protection which just prevents the machine from burning out if the water empties and the temperature inside starts to go up there is a sensor that will turn off the power supply automatically but does it taste good will it keep out all the dust from a construction site what happens if you knock it over I really like the tactil of this design and then your coffee goes in here and the other cool part of this is that this is a battery and now let's say I'm on my construction site I'm carrying my wood and oh my goodness me does it carry on making coffee no it does not so clearly this coffee machine is extremely durable and it's got all sorts of mechanisms that are going to save it from situations like that but I think it'd be so cool if this mug created a complete allaround seal with this machine so that even if you knock it like that it can carry on dripping coffee into it I'd say Makita gets a four there is some pretty serious damage on the side here but the product does still work and there is some spare coffee in this mug so thankfully I don't have to drink it cuz now we have our boiling cup of coffee I feel like it's a pretty good time for a type of product whose worst nightmare is normally Cofe keyboards so this is the Vandal resistant keyboard which to be honest I think is slightly underselling it oh my goodness M it's made of stainless steel for starters I mean how many times do you see someone buy an actually steel keyboard it's environmentally sealed against basically any incoming particle but can it take a boiling hot cup of coffee I know my keyboard couldn't so I'm playing some Red Dead Redemption right now some incredibly wide looking Red Dead Redemption for my incredibly wide keyboard the buttons require so much force to press this is like the worst possible keyboard for gaming but I will say the track ball this thing Glides you do definitely feel the side effect of a keyboard not designed for gaming like the latency is absolutely atrocious oh no I'm having to fight every Instinct in my body to film this video there's a clear reason why coffee is like the single biggest killer of electronics it's boiling hot it's wet and then if neither of those two kills it when it dries it is sticky so it's pretty clear that we we've already survived the first two of those prongs but let's come back in a little bit to see if it survives the third stepping it up to $800 now it's time for the Apple watch Ultra 2 I'm interested to see how well or how poorly an Apple product something that you'd consider quite mainstream is going to fit into this extreme caliber of indestructible Tech does it Shine or does it just get embarrassed well if you read the spec sheet Apple went hard with the ultra watches rugged Aerospace grade titanium case sapphire crystal display literally 100 m water resistance which is more than well basically any human could do without proper proper training and not even just that military level impact resistance altitude protection high temperature low temperature dust dirt temperature shock immersion freezing and thawing extreme vibration whatever that's for but okay we get it your watch is probably going to outlive you but the question that I think is more interesting is how much more durable is it actually versus a standard Apple watch and I guess even more interestingly something like the $90 Guard Pro Ultra let's find out now obviously the packaging is far simpler and less exciting but that's okay I'd much rather for $90 that they actually spent that money making the watch good and at least according to their website this thing would stands - 40° F cold and 131° heat which is funly enough 1° more than Apple and I do not think that is an accident my prediction and I guess also what you'd like to think given how much more expensive this is than this is that these guard guys haven't done anything on a hardware level that should allow this to withstand more but that they've just been looser with their claims cuz of course they're also less likely to get investigated for them now very quickly just as a watch it feels like strong sturdy solid metal construction it doesn't actually feel that dissimilar in Hardware quality to the Apple watch Ultra but here's the thing my recent trip to India has made it very clear to me that it's not expensive to make a smartwatch that feels good we paid $15 for something equivalent and the software here is not nice right this is boiling hot water it's hotter than any of these watches are rated for let's do it okay both Apple watches have turned off funny enough the guard is still on you can tell they did not like that every single Watch is completely functional all buttons work the screen works so to some extent they're almost being conservative with their temperature estimates but to be fair if you end up in literally boiling water you have bigger problems than your watch so probably a more realistic test for most people will be scratches I've got a scratch on my own personal series 9 and it goes right across the middle of the screen and I notice it every single time I look at the thing oh so the guard is quite significantly scratching even with the level six hardness pick but on both Apple watches nothing okay level Seven's a little worse on the guard and still basically nothing on the Apple Watch series 9 and since there's nothing on the series 9 I'm not surprised to see there's nothing on the ultra either which means it's level eight time this is where damage happens oh yeah it slices through the guard ah pretty significant damage to the series 9 too so what about the ultra wow very very slight damage but almost nothing I know what you're thinking though you want to see the upper limit you want to see Carnage well this is a 13.5 kg iron ball and trust me when I say you drop this on something it hurts 3 2 [Music] 1 maybe we shouldn't have shopped at IKEA I mean the fact that the table is more broken than the watch does tell you something about the watch okay so the screen is actually miraculously no more marked than it was after the scratching but clearly serious damage has happened on the inside this is dead I'm a little scared now what this is going to do to the series 9 3 2 1 but the screen is still completely functional fair play the capacitive touchscreen still works the button still works there's actually not a single sign that anything UNT has happened to this watch apart from those initial scratches and then finally sorry I it does kind of look like an Apple ad and uh yeah I guess as expected after the Apple Watch series 9 performance nothing absolutely nothing there's less damage on this after that than there is on my daily watch while we do know you clearly pay a premium for Apple products that is one hell of a design to withstand that and so ratings 5 8 10 it's Nokia time and this I am super excited to see how much has this company in the roughly 25 years since the 3310 improved their durability if at all as far as specs go this new xr21 has the military standard 810h which is like the eighth generation of what the military considers all around stress proof drop resistance rain resistance and an ip69k rating this for this has uh two layers of plastic that's it but something so simple has allowed this phone to basically reach legendary meme Overlord status as famously indestructible so the first test can both phones get wet oh I near you lost one this is 40° C Water by the way with a spot of chlorine 3 2 1 so the original Nokia 3310 oh no o it's powered down is that the end of the line already I'm actually very surprised considering what this phone is known for but yeah the Nokia 3310 is totaled the new xr21 is completely fine it literally has just Shrugged it off so clearly waterproofing has improved a lot since this thing came out but what about shatter proofing yes we're back here again we hired the Boom Lift we might as well use it for science starting with the old Nokia 3 2 1 ooh and now the new noia 3 2 1 wo that was quite impressive okay so the fact that this old Nokia is in three pieces is a little bit of a red herring cuz that is actually how it's designed to fall so that it can absorb more impact but as well as being deconstructed this is also just straight up smashed like there's a crack in the glass and the plastic is also pretty scuffed up it's no Gorilla Glass what is it like Monkey Glass okay but this right here feels like a bit of a moment of truth that was an enormous drop its counterpart has been shattered the new noia does it survive Moment of [Music] Truth oh my God this thing is just blissfully unaware of what I've done to it I mean yeah you've got a scrape up top here but this is a pretty clear sign that Nokia has done some work here this might just be the new meme phone and we don't even know it yet as far as durability is concerned 10 out of 10 I don't know where I'm walking to be honest now this so-called indestructible jacket I have to say I think it looks absolutely terrible I'm genuinely confused right now did I just pay like $600 for a jacket that comes without a proper package looks like it's made of complete plastic with all the insulation power of a tank top but okay if we just put my personal feelings aside for a minute this is made of 100% dyema black a fiber that's five times stronger than Kevlar and 15 times stronger than steel wait so it says the material we've used is so tough it was originally used in body armor anti-ballistic vehicle armor and ropes used to tie down oil rigs in violent icc's and then there's me who's probably going to use it for at most a walk in the park it comes with shatterproof buttons that it says are made with the world's toughest nuts whatever that means with claims like this and a price tag like this the thing that's going through my mind is what happens if you stab it does this coat make you invincible okay maybe I was a little bit harsh having tried it on and having seen it on this handsome fellow so maybe it's not exactly the crime against fashion that I initially pegged it as but it is still quite underwhelming looking considering the price we paid that said this is not a clothing Channel I'm interested in the technology behind this jacket wait what it's dead already and if someone came at you on the street with a flamethrower in hand you'd be well out of luck to be clear this is not just burnt it is on fire that's a problem we've got a hose I've got a hose oh no come on come on come on oh thank God thank goodness me the ripped jeans look someone's probably into this we were wondering when we first took this out why all the police don't wear something like this are they just hoping that like no one actually tests it and they just assume they're wearing an indestructible jacket right so we've already failed the fire test but I am curious how well this material stands up to other stresses Like a Chainsaw o actually that did kind of tear it but not close to as badly as a normal jacket would have [Music] been I guess this kind of demonstrates part of the problem with a jacket like this that while the jacket itself may be able to resist various different forms of damage you can't and this provides you no actual padding when it comes to that so while it is extremely cool to wear a material like that it's not actually functional for a normal person in an everyday scenario Mario it provides you no warmth no Comfort at all and no real protection at over $2,000 now this is the Traxxas xmax ultimate whose name alone probably signifies how unbelievably excessive it is we did previously test this thing's younger cousin in our fastest gadgets video if you remember that one but this is basically that on steroids oh my goodness me I'm talking energy absorbing impact cushions apparently over $11,000 in high strength aluminium placed throughout the car in all key is really $11,000 I have doubts but one thing you can't doubt is how unbelievably solid this thing feels it's got belted Sledgehammer tires and so much waterproofing that they actually recommend that you just hose it off if it gets muddy okay then 3 2 1 woohoo oh my God wait can I just carry on steering W this thing may be Invincible I am not you know I feel like the best way to demonstrate just how monstrous of a vehicle that is is to show you side by side with a normal RC car it looks like an ant I'm kind of curious what would happen if these two things collided ah and I've have not forgotten about this ridiculous Olympus camera if this is truly the authentic Never Going To Give You Up experience it should be able to withstand a full frontal assault from a 50 mph vehicle right if I miss this we get no test and I just take down the rig oh and side note I don't think in my life I have ever seen acceleration and breaking like that on a remote control car 3 2 1 the screen still on Olympus you sexy beast it's still working and as for the car much much more durable than it seems the endurance claims are no lie 9 out of 10 but now it's time to find out how much paying the premium matters for laptops because entering the firing line is the Dell Latitude 14 yeah their rugged range definitely does not come with as much packaging love as their gaming laptops wait how Earth do you open this is this some kind of LGE oh right I'm just weak but that is a hinge man if this thing is as durable as it is hard to open then we are in for a treat and it's not just durability it's got dual hot swappable batteries in case you run out of charge in the middle of nowhere the screen is touchcreen so if I tap here yeah that opens but also because it's designed to work in temperature in which your hands might well literally fall off it works with gloves too and these aren't even touchscreen gloves side note the brightness is insane which I guess is especially important for a laptop that's designed to be used out and about and the touchpad it actually feels a little bit less slick than you're probably used to but that's because this is a resistive touchpad as opposed to being a capacitive one as for what the actual difference is this is quite cool I can show you exactly what it is via the AR AI baked into the Opera desktop browser so what's the difference between a capacitive and a resistive touch panel tell me in two sentences okay so it's got an answer a capacitive touch panel uses the electrical properties of the human body to detect touch resulting in a more responsive and accurate touch experience in contrast a resistive touchscreen relies on pressure applied to the screen making it less precise and often requiring a stylus or a fingernail to operate yeah that's kind of perfect so the reason the resistive pad feels less slick is because it requires that pressure unlike your phone for example which has a capacitive screen that you can just Glide your finger across but the benefit of this over capacitive is that water messes with conduction whereas water isn't going to apply the pressure required to activate this one having an AI at your fingertips that literally the Press of a button is one of the most incredible features of the Opera browser and I strongly recommend you give it a go using my link in the description and yes this laptop is completely unharmed but here's the bigger question how does its durability compare to just a laptop case these products are summoning out a destructive side to my personality okay so obviously you are going to lose out on a lot of those extra like the battery swapability and literally if I so much as put a drop of water on this trackpad it will seize to function properly but if all you want is the impact protection then how well does a case serve the exact same purpose well this one to its credit has a lot going for it it's got a one piece hinge design with what they call an armor shell as well as a soft impact resistant core and credit Weare credits due they have also thought about a lot of the little things like the reinforced Corners like the rubberized feet like the extra grip around the areas you hold the laptop so that you're less likely to drop it in the first place so we'll start by dropping the cased MacBook Air and then we'll drop this beautiful Dell Latitude laptop Ready set go oh that sound was beautiful and haunting at the same time 3 2 1 that actually got the hinge to open right starting with the MacBook clear damage on the case itself that was the least I expected though you can see quite a bit of dirt has gotten inside the case which is not a great sign so dents all over the bottom of the laptop does it still turn on oh oh it's dead that's kind of a shame considering that most of the body is still intact I feel like that's been one of the ongoing themes in this video even if the outer Hardware is strong enough to withstand a lot of these impacts the technology at its core still has a lot of vulnerabilities what about about this though a laptop that does look a lot more like it has a reason to be in a construction site like this okay hinge opens straight away look at that screen is on do all the keys work yeah they do holy moly can you even tell what this thing has been through literally the entire damage to this laptop is a scratch that is 10 out of 10 outstanding construction right returning to this keyboard oh it looks horrendous sa to say I have sticky keys turned on but really this is still functioning as if I hadn't spilled a mug of boiling hot coffee on it and then let it sit there okay so that's good but if you're a real criminal trying to actually steal something you probably wouldn't use coffee uh how is that not even denting it what about a Hammer Hammer right to the track ball [Music] ooh that does no longer work so it feels like the materials of this construction could take 10 times the beating that I'm giving to it but it's just there must be some sort of vulnerability underneath this trackpad that I've gotten to through it you know just because I'm so curious okay yeah that does somewhat damage it I guess the most important part of a keyboard meant for high security environments is that no one can get inside and that it does achieve very well but wow yeah I mean the thickness of this keyboard is very much indicative of its durability 8 out of 10 and finally the Pelican Air carry case which is apparently designed with a super light proprietary hpx polymer that's 40% lighter than normal plastic because of course the lighter your box the less momentum it's going to have when it lands and because this is the last product in what's otherwise been a very intense video let's just do something stupid and fun this is an egg I don't think there's any way this actually works but I just want to try so we play inside this waterproof Crush prooof dustproof case and seal it off 3 2 1 feel like the next city would have heard that [Music] one the egg excitement is building there's no way that we don't have scrambled eggs inside here right it's one clasp two clasp what do you think [Music] what oh my God are you serious we're having omelets tonight"
86Gy035z_KA,Apple Vision Pro Review: Tomorrow&#39;s Ideas... Today&#39;s Tech!,Apple Vision Pro is a glimpse into the future... with today's technology Actually using Vision Pro: ...,Marques Brownlee,2024-02-04T01:40:14Z,28,"['Apple Vision Pro', 'Vision Pro', 'Apple Vision', 'MKBHD', 'Apple headset', 'VR headset', 'Apple VR', 'Vision Pro review', 'Apple Vision Pro review', 'Apple Vision review', 'Apple Vision Pro vs', 'Vision Pro vs']",PT24M48S,8155976,11889,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"- I actually love this thing. I love this thing, not because
it's flawless or anything, it is far from flawless, but because it's actually interesting. Like, don't forget the
last two, three years of Apple Product review comments are just, ""That's boring, oh, it's just a spec bump, there's nothing really new here, oh, they hardly change anything or try anything new these days."" But this, this thing is interesting. It's risky, and most of all, it's new. Now, it's actually not fundamentally new, it's a VR headset, but it's new for Apple. And there are a bunch of things in here that are new in a way
that only Apple would try. And just as interesting
as this individual product is the possible future that this implies. Like, when you get a first
generation product like this, you sort of automatically assume that there are goals for its future, that it'll have another generation and another one after that, and that there is some goal for what this will turn
into 10 years down the road because we saw what
happened with the iPhone and the Mac and the iPad and all sorts of other
first generation products. And on top of all of that, as
far as I know, Apple has never released any other
first generation product with the word Pro already in the name, which comes with a whole
nother set of implications. So is the world ready for all of this? Let's get into it. (upbeat music) So I might be one of the
20 people outside of Apple who has been using the Vision Pro the most over the past two weeks. Like, I've spent hours in
this thing with both bands, with multiple Macs, in different
setups, different rooms, indoors and outdoors,
lightness and darkness. There are parts of this thing
that are absolutely amazing, unparalleled, best I've ever seen. But the reason it's so interesting is because it's actually new and there are downfalls
and flaws and trade-offs that come alongside all of this stuff. So at the end of the last video, I gave you guys a sort of a preview of my pros and cons list. If you haven't already watched that video, it is definitely worth watching, almost like a prequel to this one. It is a 30 minute monster all
about how to use this thing, how it works, what's inside,
what it's capable of. And then, at the end, I got to my upsides, which are immersiveness,
placement and space, eye tracking and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio. And the downsides, which
are weight and comfort, the eyes on the outside, app selection right now,
battery life, and price. So, okay, for starters, I wanna amend immersiveness to fidelity, I think that's more accurate here. I have used a bunch of
different VR headsets now, and this Vision Pro has the sharpest, best looking micro-OLED
display out of all of them. The size of individual
pixels on these displays is seven and a half microns, which means you could fit 64 of them in the size of a single
iPhone screen's pixel. You can't see individual pixels, there's no screen door
effect, it's awesome. The native refresh rate is 90 hertz and it will crank up to 96 hertz when there's 24 FPS content
playing to be an even multiple. And Apple says that they calibrate every single one of
these Vision Pro displays from the factory for
maximum color accuracy. They're really good, and this is a big reason why
this headset is so expensive. But then, and this is gonna
be a recurring theme here, the Vision Pro runs up against
the technology of today not being quite advanced enough to accomplish what they were
probably hoping as ideal. So in the case of these screens, right, they're amazing, there are so many pixels, but because there's so many pixels, the computer inside cannot
actually render everything in high resolution all
the time at 90 Hertz. So instead, it does something clever. It combines the insanely fast eye tracking with what's called foveated rendering, meaning, it's only actually
rendering in high resolution exactly what you're looking
at when you're looking at it. The rest is soft and fuzzy. That actually works really well because that's exactly how our eyes work. It's really clever, like
you don't think about it, but the thing that you're looking
at at the moment is sharp, but then the rest of
your peripheral vision is soft and fuzzy, and that's fine. So really, now, all of the
computing work is being done to track your eyes as fast as possible so that there's no lag between when you look at something
and when it becomes sharp. Fun fact, you can actually see this in screen recordings from the Vision Pro. You can see the piece of the screen that I'm looking at is sharp, and then everything else around it, even parts of the same
window are fuzzy on purpose. But to my eye, that looks totally natural because I'm focusing
on one thing at a time. I found that you can also screen record with developer mode in Xcode,
and that'll make the clips 4K and it'll render everything
in HQ all at once. But every time I did that, it would be choppy and scrolling
would be slow and jittery. And I'm thinking that's just because the computers aren't really
used to rendering everything in high quality all the time. So it looks like a
higher quality recording, but the second I did any
scrolling, it didn't look as good, so I just didn't use
those recordings as often. So the screens are great, the position tracking of
objects and space are great, the eye tracking is incredibly good. The one ding against immersion
on the Vision Pro though, and not a lot of people
are talking about this, but it's the field of view. See, the first few times
you use this headset, you don't even really
think about it that much. You're so distracted by
all the fun and the newness and how cool it is that your
eyes are controlling the thing. But eventually, you start
to poke around the edges and it turns out, you
know how people are saying it kind of looks like ski
goggles from the outside? Well, it also kind of
looks like ski goggles from the inside a little bit too. Again, the middle is super
sharp and incredibly impressive, but if I can do my best here
through a YouTube video, the edges of the headset
are a little bit further in than the edges of your vision. And so, there's a little bit
of like a cone effect going on and there's some chromatic
aberration around the outside. So you kind of have this slight feeling of looking into a large
tunnel at everything. There are actually no
field of view numbers published by Apple
anywhere about Vision Pro, as far as I can tell, and I kind of think that's on purpose because I have noticed
from using them both that the Quest 3 has a
better, wider field of view just looking inside the headset. So if I could change one
thing about the Vision Pro to make it more immersive, it would be a wider field
of view, no question. (upbeat music) Vision Pro has the best
passthrough of any headset I've ever used, that much
is super clear to me, and weirdly enough, this doesn't actually surprise me either. Maybe because this is one of the products that makes it so obvious that they're thinking
a lot about the future, like Apple talks a lot about AR and how they want things to just be clear and just overlaying things
onto your real world. But with today's technology, again, that's not quite possible yet. So instead they have a VR headset, but they are using the highest
quality camera feeds possible and the highest quality
displays on the inside possible to let you almost feel like you're looking through
it at the real world. So you put this headset on, and the first thing
you see is passthrough, I mean, you might as well
call it transparency mode. And the sharpness and the colors and the very low latency are all so good that I really don't
experience any eye fatigue, no matter how long I am
in this passthrough mode, despite my eyes being
inches from these screens, I can interact with the
real world around me, pick things up and look at them, I can walk around, between
rooms and not trip on things. I tried having people throw things at me and I could just catch them. I played table tennis
successfully with the headset on, which is crazy if you think about what's actually happening here. The total latency Apple
says is 12 milliseconds, that's from the outside light
hitting the outside sensors to the inside image being updated
and hitting your eyeballs, that's incredibly fast, and that includes the
exposure time of the cameras. That's the specially
designed R1 chip at work. But, as Nilay from The Verge has put it, it's still cameras and screens, like the technology of today isn't magic. So you still have to
expose a camera sensor and set ISO and shutter speed, et cetera, and you can kind of play
around with this a bit just by looking around
like at bright objects or high dynamic range environments. And you know what, for the variety of situations
I've thrown at this thing, it's handled it very
impressively the whole time, mostly prioritizing smoothness
and high shutter speeds at the expense of cranking up the ISO and getting way more noise, especially in darker environments. But you can still see stuff like the hand occlusion breaks sometimes or look really janky
when you put your hand in front of something. You can still see objects start
to float a little bit more in X, Y, and Z space when
you're in much lower lighting, as opposed to the usual perfect position. Again, it's the best I've
ever seen with today's tech, but it definitely still
has a long way to go. (upbeat music) So honestly, the
ecosystem is, I would say, the strongest argument
for a regular person going out and buying today's
version of the Vision Pro. Like, every time a new big
product comes out or whatever, I get like texts from people, ""Oh hey, Marques, you know, I know you already made like
a 30 minute video about it and like unboxed it and did all that, but like what do you really
think about the Vision Pro? Like, is it good enough?
Should I get one?"" And, truthfully, probably not. But I will say that there
are a good amount of things that I do specifically look
forward to using for it, and most of those things
are ecosystem related. So obviously there's the
built-in apps, right? iMessage works perfectly, just like any iPhone or
iPad on your account, photos are all loaded up in
here straight from your iPhone. This is clearly the headset that is best for iPhone
users, Apple ecosystem people, but also, little things
too, like continuity. So I can copy some text
on my Mac or my iPhone and then hit Paste and it
shows up in the Vision Pro. But there's two really
impressive ones to me for very different specific reasons, FaceTime and Mac Virtual Display. See, FaceTime is the most only
Apple could ship this thing I've seen in a long time. From the personas scanned
in from the cameras on the front of the headset
to the positional tracking and responsiveness of the spatial audio, it's all so well thought
out that, you know, once everyone on the call gets past the initial
like, ""Ah, what is this?"" The shock, the moment they first see the virtual version of you, once they first get past that, then it actually kind
of slowly gets easier and it feels way more
like a normal conversation than a normal FaceTime. And it trades the
downside of not being able to hold up objects to
your camera for a button that can switch to a real
time first person view where you can use both
hands instead of one. Does the audio from these speakers still bleed out into the rest of the world so anything over half
volume is incredibly audible to everyone in the room around you? Yeah, but does it also still
sound really, really impressive for not actually being real headphones? Yeah. But the other thing is
Mac Virtual Display. This is my number one favorite
feature of the Vision Pro, even over like watching movies and stuff. Now, first of all, yes, you can already do
remote desktop viewing on something like a Quest 3,
it's great, I love that too. But this one is way more interesting. So this is connecting to your Mac and then intaking and re-rendering a new virtual display for your Mac, not mirroring what's already
being shown by your computer. So you can use your Mac with
all of its existing controls you're already using with it, but make your new monitor
literally as big as you want. And then, you can open up
simultaneous Vision Pro apps all around that Mac display and place them all around
the room wherever you want, over the walls, floating in midair, pin them to other objects,
whatever, you can go nuts. Now, is this perfect? No, there are definitely trade-offs. From even the little things, like not being able to see your keyboard when you're in an immersive environment, to only being able to have a single virtual Mac monitor at a time, to always having to look
where you're controlling, I keep telling you guys, there's definitely extra
brain cycles involved here. But I do still think
that, despite all that, this is my number one favorite
feature of this Vision Pro. The number one thing
that you can buy it for and do that you couldn't do
with any other Apple product. I mean, it's the difference between looking like this in a coffee shop or looking like this in a coffee shop. Pick your poison, I guess. I also had a moment where I was using the Vision Pro for a
while and I had my Mac and some other monitors around me, and then I took it off and
then I went and did something and then I came back, and before
I put the headset back on, I looked up at the wall to where I thought a window was gonna be, but I hadn't, I hadn't... I don't know if that says
more about the headset or about me. (upbeat music) But speaking of apps, we
gotta get into the weaknesses. And the app situation on Vision Pro right now is one of them. So this is the home
screen of the Vision Pro, it has all of your apps,
you can't rearrange them, it's always alphabetical. And this is a developing situation that will record and improve over time, but as of right now, as I
record this on launch day, there are literally 600 apps
made for the Vision Pro. And that sounds like a lot at first, but then kind of not a lot. There are also the millions of other apps that are made for the iPad that are compatible with the
Vision Pro that will show up. But there's 600 apps made
specifically for the Vision Pro. The few apps that are showing
up here are pretty incredible, and they all kind of find
unique and creative ways to take advantage of the 3D space. And I fully believe the
rest of the developers are also kind of still trying
to figure out what to do with the 3D space in their own apps, or even if it makes sense
to do anything at all beyond the normal iPad app. But at this point right now today, I honestly believe that
there are way more cool ideas about VR and AR experiences
than there are actual apps. Now, don't get me wrong,
there are some cool apps, and like I said, I've shown
some in the past video, there are some more in this video and there will be more
of them pop up every day. But have you seen that video
of gamifying vacuum cleaning so that you can actually cover your entire floor space like a game? It's not a real app, but if it was, it would be pretty sick
and I would totally use it. Or maybe you've seen that other video of watching an F1 race in
Vision Pro, it is so sick, it's like there's a virtual
track overlaid into your space so you can keep track of
everything happening at once, plus the times and, you
know, smaller video feeds of the battles around
different points of the track. This looks genuinely better than the actual TV broadcast experience, but it's also not a real app
yet, it's just a concept. And I've seen all kinds of other stuff and I wanna watch an NBA game court side in the Vision Pro too, but that experience doesn't
seem to exist yet either. Whatever it is about like Apple
jumping into this new space and all the implications of like, oh, okay, the tech is gonna
start to get better now, this sort of unlocked
this new creative layer for people to dream of
new AR and VR experiences, and it'll be up to developers to actually make that
stuff happen over time, with the constraints
of today's technology. But as of right now, not a lot of apps, also, no YouTube app, no Netflix app, there's no Spotify app,
there's no TikTok app yet. I hope that Apple can sort
of patch up the relationship with these developers
because getting those apps will make this a better product. But as of right now, that is definitely a weakness
of this first gen product. (upbeat music) All right, I'm not the only
one who's been saying this, but this is not the
most comfortable headset and I figured out why. So first of all, everyone's
mentioned the weight, and it's true, it does weigh like 25% more than a lot of other headsets. Like, take the Quest 3, for example, probably the most popular
one, familiar to most people, that's mostly plastic
and it weighs 515 grams. So Vision Pro being made of
metal and having all this glass, weighing in at nearly 650 grams, it kind of seems like Apple just didn't care about the weight. But I don't think that's the case. Matter of fact, if you've
seen the tear downs or if you've seen what's inside this little computer here on your face, this is built incredibly efficiently. There's carbon fiber in here, magnesium, all sorts of other lightweight materials. Now there's still lots
of obvious heft on it, but 25% more weight
shouldn't be the difference between comfortable and, like,
I need to do neck exercises. No, the problem is this strap, this is the Solo Knit strap, this is the strap that's
in all the commercials that everybody sees. This is what's on Apple's website, it's in all the Apple stores
because it looks so cool. And I think when Apple was
probably first deciding, okay, we are gonna get into
this VR headset market, how do we differentiate ourselves? We gotta reinvent a few things, like the input method and all this stuff. I think they thought the
strap had to be one of them, and that's how we got this thing. And I think Dave2D was spot
on in his recent video, VR headsets just kind of all look dumb, and the straps on them are all
so universally lame looking. And this strap is just so much cooler, you put it on, it's
the quickest to adjust, it messes up your hair the least. It obviously has this
little adjustment thing on the outside so you
can scroll this wheel and satisfyingly like tighten
the cables inside like this. This must have taken a lot of R&D to get this thing to look iconic and actually be functional, this is sick. But when you put it on, you sort of tighten it up
against the front of your face and it's squeezing it
up against your face, all of the weight, up at the front against basically these
two pressure points, right above your eyes
and right on your cheeks. And the more you tighten
it to prevent light leak, the more uncomfortable it gets. And it's just, it's so hard to wear this for more than about 30, 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, I really
do need to take this off. So it's not your neck as much as it's just all the pressure
on the front of your face. And Apple knows this, and that's why they've included
in the box this second band, this is the dual loop band, and it's super easy to pop this
one off and pop this one on. Now it's not as cool
looking as a Solo Knit Band, and it's going to mess up your hair more than a Solo Knit Band, and it's not as easy to
adjust as a Solo Knit Band. You're literally like trying to find and attach Velcro blindly
at the top of your head. Basically, it's almost as lame looking as every other VR headset strap. But it turns out they all
look like this for a reason, and oh my God, is it so much better for wearing it for a long time. I just recently did the last episode of the ""Waveform Podcast"", you can go subscribe over there. I wore the headset for the entire thing, a two hour recording, and I could never have done
that with the Solo Knit Band, and that's because it's
taking a ton of the pressure off of the front of your
face and taking the weight and using the top of your
head to support it instead. It's so much better. So if you're gonna just hand the headset to someone to use it
for like five minutes, the Solo Knit Band is great 'cause it's super quick,
doesn't mess up their hair, easy to adjust, boom. But if you plan on using this thing for an extensive period of time, yeah, the dual loop band is 100% the way to go. (upbeat music) So I don't know if the eyes
on the outside of this headset are actually accomplishing what Apple probably
wanted them to accomplish. I think this, again, comes down
to what we expect Vision Pro to be in the future, see through
glasses, way down the line. But that's obviously not
possible with today's tech, so the closest we can get
is a lenticular display that shows your eyes to the outside world, and so that you can see them
and they can kind of see you. I don't know, at this
point, I've tried my eyes, but also everyone else here at the studio has also scanned themselves
in and tried EyeSight, and it's just not very visible. Like, the smooth glass of the headset is so incredibly reflective that there's almost always
some light bouncing off it in a way that makes the eyes hard to see. And even if you can see it, it's pretty low resolution, thanks to the lenticular display, and the bottom line is it doesn't actually feel like eye
contact most of the time, which is very different from what you might have seen in the ads, especially for darker skin tones. And I was actually
thinking about this like, this is so far from
what I think I expected that I was wondering, does Apple in the next
generation Vision Pro double down on EyeSight
or do they get rid of it? And I think they have to keep it, like it's such an iconic
part of the headset that everyone's expecting it to stay, so it's gotta be there. But also, this is Vision
Pro and I think that implies that we're gonna get Apple Vision at some point down the road, which is like a less
expensive version of this. And with that, do you take out EyeSight or does that still appear
in the lower end version? I don't know, only time will tell. (upbeat music) So, all right, look,
at the end of the day, when I'm answering those texts about what do people wanna know what I really think about Vision Pro, I think the Vision Pro is a really expensive, really fun toy. Like, this is an incredibly
fun piece of tech to play with, and I am loving watching
the pieces of media built specifically for Vision Pro, I am loving playing some
of the new early games that are taking advantage of the 3D space and the hand controls, I am loving the idea of getting on a plane and editing videos on my Mac or watching a movie on a gigantic screen while the person next to me
can't see any of what I'm doing. That stuff is all so sick. And if you're actually
thinking about buying one, I think you should be able to expect to enjoy all of that same stuff too. But definitely still note
that all of the symptoms of a first generation product are definitely also still here. It's heavy, it's not a lot of apps, the battery life is
meh and it's expensive. So here's the bigger question, is the Vision Pro a guaranteed
success in the future? Because the first generation iPhone had all of the same
downfalls in its generation, and look at where we are now. So, also, same with the
watch, same with the iPad. But here's the thing, you can't just say the other stuff had problems
and it became successful, therefore, this one having problems also means it's successful. It doesn't work that way, there has to be something about this that people actually like that makes 'em willing to overlook the first generation downfalls. And I think this has it, I think it has, I honestly, it's kind of
just the sci-fi, fun nature of like controlling
things with your hands, moving windows around the room, the sci-fi movie energy, you've seen it, you're probably already
thinking of a certain movie that has that sort of
energy, this has that. And the fact that these ideas of what people wanna do in VR are so universally well liked and so cool, that means that there's something here, there's something that people want, even in this first generation. Now, will all this new attention on VR headsets in general
shine a lot of light on all of the other
much cheaper competitors that you should probably
buy instead of this one, like the $500 Quest 3? Yeah. Now, will all this new developer attention in this VR/AR space bring
a lot of way cooler, way more awesome applications that will rapidly improve
the value proposition of this $3,500 first gen headset? Yeah. Should you go out and buy one of these if you've got the money and you saw one or two
really cool looking apps that you wanna try from the videos? Sure, why not? It's your money. But I'm already very excited
for the next generation. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one, peace. (bright music)"

products on the entire planet so that's phones yes but also bigger things like literally the biggest limited edition product I've ever unboxed and we're going to start with something pretty Cutting Edge but only in the very literal sense this is a £45 or $56 razor oh my God this package is insane how much do they think I lift oh my God Cy this isn't four Gamers by Gamers this is four bodybuilders by Psychopaths ah but yeah this razor is made in what must be the weirdest Tech collab I've ever seen Gillette and Razer you know the gaming company apparently this is a magnetic display stand but I have doubts and it says four Gamers by Gamers which I find kind of hilarious as the last thing your hair will ever see but you know what's even stranger about all of this it originated as an April Falls joke in 2023 Razer made this absolutely ridiculous trailer for a fictional product a mouse that you could also use to keep your facial hair in check while gaming cuz you know us real Gamers don't leave the basement for months at a time and while obviously they didn't make that that trailer had such a vocal reception that it must have triggered the thought wait a sec why doesn't Razer make a Razer did it do a good job did it I can't see it's actually a really good shape which I'm not actually surprised by it cuz this is a limited edition version of the exact same Gillette Labs razor that I've just recently showed you I've been carrying around every day in my backpack anyway do you mind filming from that side only I've not not had hair on here for 8 years probably but now we move all the way up to $300 with the Starfield Chrono Mark Smartwatch for those of you who don't know Starfield was one of the most hyped video game launches in recent history it was meant to be open world exploration but on an interplanetary scale like you see a planet or a moon you can land on that planet or Moon I mean the game had to be a pretty big deal for them to make a custom Smart watch Just For The Limited Edition version of it so this is the steelbook display case inside of which no way that's a cred stick these are the uh for some reason physical currency in this space age futuristic setting and on the back is the code to redeem the game that is such a smart way to fuse the game's world into the real world but this is what you're mostly paying for the Chrono Mark watch which again is an actual in-game item that you play with oh OD AR near my butter fingers I got to say whoever designed this packaging needs a pat on the back I mean this is proper metal running down the sides the detailing as well I feel so immersed and then to open it wait so pull down and then twist oh my God the nerd inside of me is struggling to cope so this is a constellation patch constellation is the faction trying to uncover the mysteries of the universe this thing is called the chronome mark watch established in 2188 that's pretty cool and then oh this interior material is incredible it's like really bouncy Rubber and then the watch itself it feels a lot more premium than I was expecting it to all the plastic areas have this nice matte finish and then all the metallic areas are actual metal wa not bad you know what it can actually do quite a lot too so obviously it tells the time but what's quite clever is because the clock hands go around the edge of the screen at all times you can keep reading the time while also doing other things wish my Apple watch had that so it's got the current moon phase it's got a temperature sensor barometer magnetometer it's coming pretty close to making me feel like a real astronaut accelerometer so you know it can measure your steps and it also connects to your phone via Bluetooth so if I tap this for example yeah I can play and pause the songs from my phone Spotify it's definitely not an Apple Watch replacement it's a simple watch but just done really well and you got to admit there is something so uniquely surreal about wielding in your real hands items that you spent the last 6 month month holding in your virtual hands in a video game it looks like every time you turn it off it gives you a different parting message or quote from a sci-fi movie this feels an awful lot like a 9 out of 10 to me now this is where being able to look at all limited edition Tech and not just phones starts to get juicy when two companies do a cool special collab we can test the full Suite of Products that come from it so you know Transformers right well bumblebe is one of the most famous he's one of the Autobots the good guys and while not the biggest or the strongest he just he tries very hard and that's endearing in its own way so the tech company red magic decided to bottle his yellow puppy dog energy into a mouse a keyboard and a phone so first is the mouse they call this the ultra Edition and to be fair they price it like an ultra Edition too but that does mean a few cool things though see when you really get into mice it's not just about how smooth it Glides across your surface it's also about the level of sensitivity how many pixels or dots that your mouse cursor moves across per inch that you physically move your mouse or the DPI a normal office Mouse might go up to like 2,000 DPI or 5,000 DPI gaming mice like this one 26,000 okay so this is the lowest DPI setting oh my goodness that's painful yeah you could not play like that you turn it around you click the DPI button and it turns it up now straight away this is like the stock DPI that most non-gaming mice would ship with and it's workable I now only have to move my wrist instead of my whole arm so let's go up another level oh okay so this is starting to feel very sensitive this feels like enough DPI for any kind of competitive gamer who needs twitch controls and the ability to kind of instantly spin around so what happens when we go up again ah hey okay it's starting to get a little bit dizzy with this motion but I suppose the benefit of this is that now I barely need to move my physical movements are now basically imperceptible but you can see how much differ difference it's making on the screen the mouse is accurate enough that it feels like you're taking full advantage of that DPI and it's not disorienting the design though it does look sick it's pretty nice and Meaty to rip onto if we just plug it in oh yes the LEDs are Tastefully done I got to say it's not too much it's just the logo at the back and then these two on either side of the mouse buttons which I assume are bumble be's eyes so the lights actually turn on when you leave the mouse on standby but then as soon as you grip it and move it they turn off it does make a lot of sense for a Bluetooth mouse cuz you don't want to spend all of your precious battery life lighting up his eyes although I will say glossy translucent plastic is an interesting choice for the single tech product most prone to fingerprints and by interesting I of course mean brain dead because uh good luck keeping this clean but I do feel like it's going to look really cool together once we've unboxed all the Bumblebee stuff so keyc cap remover a braided cable and this is the mechanical keyboard oh la la yes this is like the most unashamedly committed to the brief design I think I've ever seen it's got a brushed aluminium body this feels good I love the slightly passive aggressive win more games Motif that they've got plastered across it like okay I'll try it also just feels like a really nicely built keyboard this is one of red Magic's first mechanical keyboards ever it's quite difficult to get this much right on your first attempt so you can toggle your lighting Effects by pressing FN insert W there some really funky ones and having this like dedicated lighting strip really draws your attention to it you can toggle colors with FN plus delete and then the speed of the animation and the brightness of the keys with FN plus your arrow keys which is a pretty nicely done system cuz you've got complete control without needing any external programs but I will say the lighting is not the brightest H if you look from the side you can see the keyboard has quite a significant downward slope which some people like for you know key reachability but I person find a bit of a pain like literally a bit of a pain cuz I've caused myself quite a bit of hand trouble from all this arching but here's the question on my mind why is there a screen on the keyboard we just finally got rid of screens on keyboards on the MacBooks now we got another one okay so it gives you volume control well that's kind of pointless since volume control is literally a key press away anyway you can monitor your computer's performance which again your computer internally monitors its own stats anyway and then you've got control over lighting brightness speed color so it's literally a complete duplication of the functionality already embedded within the keyboard that's a bit disappointing I was expecting the screen to add some sort of new dimension the only thing that's somewhat cool about it is it does let you upload your own images to it and display them as like a permanent piece of customization but then at the same time what a tremendous waste of battery life but this is where the real fun comes with the mechanical keyboard the actual key mechanism there's so many different types of key mechanism you can go for some are Ultra clicky and typewriter light but you can also go all the way to the complete opposite like super short key travel and no noise at all oh oh yes this is one of the best keyboards I've ever felt in my life these feel about halfway in between those two extremes they're quite low travel so that you can press very quickly but they also really let you feel when each key has been pressed which is really useful for games because in a way then you're looking at your screen and your keyboard is reinforcing to you that you are indeed pressing the things that you think you're pressing you can also really feel the gasket structure which is basically a layer of rubber that absorbs the vibration it makes clicking softer but it also means that when I click this key for example that impact feels completely isolated from the key sitting right next to it so let's add the phone into that mix and it really feels like there's someone at the Hasbro company whose entire job is just to hand out licensing deals for Transformers themed gadgets I'm pretty sure we've seen more limited edition Transformers products than like any other brand ever not that I'm complaining though they do look amazing so the phone comes in a hexagonal box kind of poetic for a bumblebee now I think about it there's a gaming fan which looks every bit as Extreme as you'd want it to on a phone this price a metal badge this is not half-hearted stuff too I am on board the charger featuring Bumblebee's not so pretty face on it and it's a very fast charger too but I'll get back to that what's in here Sim ejector which has the Autobots logo oh manuals with every page also in theme clap clap and a case with a magnetic ring which looks like it's specifically designed for this coing fan to attach and then the phone oh no no no it keeps going there's not one but two USBC cables one yellow one black holy cow guys I'm just thinking actually does this case allow it to work with apple mag safe okay so yeah it snaps in it's just the phone doesn't have any wireless charging support well that feels intuitive I have to say this thing looks so good if I was not a blue and white kind of guy I would be a yellow and black guy it is still a glassback phone but they've really made it look like metal with this whole plate behind it and you can even see the exposed actual black metal screws it's very fitting for a robot themed phone and this fan is also pretty Next Level this is a new gen caller that extends the refrigeration area to Now cover basically the entire contact surface but also it can now constantly monitor the temperature inside of the phone and scale its own output according to the needs of the phone but with the ability to cool the phone down by up to 30° C if needed I'm actually so hot right now oh my goodness me that is the best thing ever it's insane it's like a it's like a handheld refrigerator oh it's so reliably consistently cold and it's not cool this is cold cold to the touch I mean just to give you an idea a 30° difference is enough to take you from a hot hot room into a room so cold that you would get frostbite if you stayed there you try it are you a fan oh also the charger that you saw this thing right here can do 165 W fast charging which is a pretty absurd figure so the phone is empty right now let's plug it in and come back in a few minutes to see just how fast 3 2 1 go and it's already off how is it at 1% already now I don't know if this is just a British thing but it feels to me like Harry Potter was such a massive part of everyone's childhood every Christmas drisha and I basically do a movie marathon of the entire series and that's why seeing it all in tech form which is like my current passion hits so hard for me we actually have seen a Harry Potter film before but this is meant to be the next level up from that plus there's now a Harry Potter tablet too so let's get into the phone first my goodness it feels like one of those uh interactive story books this is an image of diagonale by the way if you know you know then the phone and behind it that's the Sword of godric Gryffindor is this some sort of code for something I can't figure it out please tell me we're actually getting a sword in here oh right yeah okay well it's a 90 W charger and cable well that's a bummer but to be fair it's actually impressively small for a 90 W charging brick it's about the same size as Apple's 27 W one there's a second compartment I like the Sim ejector that's the Hogwart School emblem and on the inside I love this case if you're feels very much designed with this specific version of the phone in mind and then on the inside is a soft felt finish with a dementa carved in which is not going to be enough to suck the fun out of this for [Music] me there's actually so much going on here considering that the phone at a glance doesn't actually look messy they have crammed in a lot of Easter eggs you know I'm not even the resident Harry Potter expert can you help me out I love this this is so awesome okay so what are all these okay so I actually have no idea what these are I know what all of these are that's the Hogwarts emblem Draco Dorian nunquam titas it's actually really strange it sounds really fancy and it means never tickle a sleeping Dragon what I think it's meant to be like you know the quote um let sleeping dogs lie it's like if you see a sleeping Dragon don't tickle it noted what are all these things so these are all the seven haw rockes is it a spoiler if I explain a HS is there such thing as Harry Potter spoilers at this day Voldemort split his soul into seven different pieces so that he can't die just by someone killing him so the seven different things that he split into these are the seven things the seven items that's so cool it's Harry's lightning bolt where the flash is and then it says lumos because that's where you're lighting up from and lumos is a spell for light would you switch from an iPhone to this yes hand it over hand it over i' switch for this backing this is a verbal contract oh I've just realized the curvature on this k case perfectly matches the curvature on the phone such that when you put them together that's how you do it that is how you do it it's shocking that I'm so surprised by this but you'd be amazed how many companies don't think to match their case designs with the phone designs 64% 64% how long has it been 15 and 1 12 minutes that is extremely fast just before we turn it all on the tablet is something completely new similarly really tasteful box design it looks a lot like the excellent book cover art that we've had over the years what is in this it's not the tablet but it's so heavy oh the back has the long quote from the Sorting Hat trying to decide whether to put Harry in Slytherin or Gryffindor what oh my goodness it's hogwart's invitation letter but like also a proper leather-like carrying case with a magnet where the stamp is I don't think I've ever been fanboying as hard as I am right now with this limited edition and then inside is is this another case yeah it looks like a hard case as a second option but hats off no P Nintendos to whoever made this this is a surreal experience and then there's another little slide out box which has stickers four pages of stickers okay then underneath the tablet three more boxes oh man don't tell me we're going to be able to control this thing with a wand uh okay oh that's still pretty cool though it's a one colored very clearly custom stylus with Harry's lightning bolt next to the charging port in here is a Sim ejector tool and then manuals and in the final box is oh you doing so well it's just a standard white power brick and cable all right let's see what the bootup screens look like oh that was kind of funky smoker mirrors the tablet was a bit less interesting so the theming on this phone is it's okay it's a little half-hearted I would say some icons are completely gold others have a little gold ring but they're still their normal colors there's actually very little they've done to this phone the folders look cool I guess oh this is cool the always on display has this smoke disappearing effect is this the Ravenclaw diadem yeah okay so thank you so look at this it's like smoke effect oh wait no it's changing oh that's even cooler cuz that's one of the other HW cruxes which one the locket of Voldemort technically correct thank you wait so then every time you turn your phone on and off it Cycles to a new H Crux wow that's wicked what about when you plug it in oh it's kind of cool also just realized there's a little wizard's hat on the lock screen o no way quick way to change a wallpaper between the various houses isn't it kind of crazy that we live in a time where this whole package was $500 like all the effort and thought that went into this limited edition but even forgetting all of that just just how much phone you now get like this thing right here is a nearly top-of-the-line chip it's a nice OLED display it's 16 gigs of RAM 512 gigs of storage 50 map main camera using Sony's light 600 sensor which is part of a whole new range of sensors which are designed for mid-range phones but I wonder if they're specifically better since it is a brand new Range okay so let's compare dr's old phone to D's new phone oh no the Harry Potter phone photo is atrocious compared to the iPhone the difference is actually insane oh yeah I'm wanting to do this for a while lumos okay it's meant to turn the flashlight on the tablet's design is a lot simpler than the phone's design which is strange considering it has four times the canvas size to play with but I'm assuming they've done that because of the stickers oh I've just realized they've themed each one of these Pages after one of the houses I think I'm a Ravenclaw bu here we go I don't know what any of these items are so this is a 120 HZ 12.1in display which is quite a nice size but it's only an LCD screen I guess because your screen is going to be a much bigger part of the cost of a tablet than it is on a phone you can save a lot by going for LCD versus OLED but you can tell it looks pretty washed out and is not nearly as bright as the phone the thing is also just a lot less powerful than the phone in every way like less powerful chip less Ram Less storage and it's a bit weird because your tablet especially big tablets like this are usually where your proper work happens I'm guessing the company just decided that all of these Harry Potter products they need to be affordable and to make a tablet as affordable as a phone you need to cut more corners or you know bmot secretly their business manager ah so this is the redmi Smart patter I've just connected via Bluetooth it's actually surprisingly responsive and it's got not one but two different buttons on it so I can use one of them to cycle between which instrument I'm writing with and the other one Cy between the color that's actually really well executed and that one has just turned to 100% how long exactly 30 minutes exactly 30 okay so the second half of charging is definitely slower than the first half but that's to be expected and it's actually got really really hot now that it's charged let's actually have a little look at this [Music] phone who you cannot say they don't try oh that wallpaper bumblebee is meant to be a pretty fast guy so it's kind of cool that every single time you leave an app they've got this interactive wallpaper in which he Zips forward back into frame and they also give you quite a lot of different always on display options too feel like Transformers fans really get treated man this just makes me think red magic phones they're not perfect you know they do need to work on their camera quality and their software a bit but also holding this in my hands right now I I I can't shake the feeling that this as a slab of Hardware is perfected I love the two-tone finish on the the back I love the smooth matte sides the slim borders of the phone and the fact that they're completely even plus the front camera is invisible I just feel like as a concept this right here is what we've been dreaming of ever since the very first smartphone now I got to give a rating for all of these okay six 7 this gets a nine and a sub to the channel would be transformative now for something that I 100% guarantee you did not see coming this is the minions of insta 360's goto camera I won't lie to you I can't stand the minions I know this is an unpopular opinion but I nearly walked out of the cinema during minions 3 and I just drove past the cinema the other day to see that there's another one coming and I nearly H but I also someone who can appreciate a really well themed limited edition so this is the camera and what I really like about it is that it feels purposeful you can really tell that this collab didn't come about from like hm which brand is going to bring the biggest media attention to our product but instead hey our camera already kind of looks like a minion wouldn't it be funny if is a really high quality paint job and it's just such a fun thumb-sized way to record some actually pretty decent looking 1440p video but this at its core is a go two whereas the company's actually just launched their next Generation go 3s and is sponsoring this video so I can give you an early look at it essentially they've taken the perks of all their previous go cameras that they weigh less than 40 G that they come with all the magnets and attachments that you place them basically anywhere but now with a big focus on video quality because this now shoots in 4K resolution they made a 40 G camera that shoots 4K I have pens that weigh more than 40 G so I have no idea what they've done to make that happen whenever I use these go cameras this is how I do it so you put the included magnetic necklace on and the camera just snaps in place it automatically turns itself on it turns itself off it records Snippets throughout your day and it can even edit them for you to the beat of a song and also now with the 3s if you're lose it you can find it with Apple's fine my and you can connect it to the action pod to turn it into a full-on vlogging style camera with a rotating screen and 140 minutes of battery life per charge so link below to check it out with a free extra screen protector I've also realized something really cool about this watch it rotates the watch face based on which way up I'm looking at it now this confuses me this is the limited edition strawberry bare phone here's the thing even with his cute fluffy strawberry scented exterior this guy is one of the main villains from Toy Story why does he get his own limited edition anyways in the first box oh oh it actually smells like strawberry like really noticeably so there's a case I have no idea what this is a bracelet juvenile handcuffs and this is maybe a phone stand wait let me just take a sniff wow it literally smells like I've dived head first into a cinema pick and mix stand so then the phone box you can see the word loto written everywhere which which is actually short for Lotso hug and bear you know the character's actual name a Sim ejector with his cursed face stamped onto it there's an insert with an about me card goodness me a page of matte stickers and then a completely clear case there's the phone below which nothing really of note it looks like okay so does the phone smell a strawberry no no it doesn't so what's the deal with this loto bear well turns out he is super popular in China he is mass-produced he's unusually fluffy for a villain and he smells like strawberry like very literally oh my God it's so good and so he's actually become a bit of a sensation outside of his real origin people are buying him as the strawberry bear not even knowing what he's from or who he was this is the guy who tried to kill Woody Buzz and the Gang the phone itself has basically the same design as the case it's like very nearly cute with all the fruit patterned across it and the soft gold highlights going around the trim but then you look down and shivers the bear's face is like no joke 3D sculpted onto the back of this so I can feel every Contour this dude makes me so uneasy with his like eyebrows and face it's very very immediately clear though how much thought has gone into the skin and even the wallpaper almost looks like real fur you're touching let's have a look at the charging animation [Music] no way strawberries are just falling into his hand like so much effort has gone into this and it's so strange now I just realized also they've developed a custom font for the lock screen clock every part of this user interface looks like you could stroke it so apparently we should have custom loto frames that we can use around our photos oh my goodness that is absolutely atrocious thanks strawberry bear I hate it but probably the craziest part of this whole thing is that loto bear should also be your assistant here oh to think this dude is hiding within your software skin at all times but I have to give credit where credits du for what it is it's really cool to get actually scentered stuff and I realized the reason I wasn't completely sure what this is is because I couldn't see how it attaches to your phone well magnets there's a ring of magnets in this case which allows the bear to just snap on and that is your phone stand and then if you really well and truly want to create a monster and this weird lanyard handcuff thing attaches to the bottom like so who is this for who who would buy this I think this is meant to be endearing but it feels like a form of torture I mean as far as the execution goes I feel like it's hard to argue that this is not a 10 out of 10 but it's just that the idea that feels like a two to me I think I've got some weird strawberry bear phobia I'm not a fan now with the majority of limited edition phones they're not actually more expensive than the company's normal phones they're not really designed for profit but instead just made in really small quantities to create a sort of buzz but when Lamborghini gets involved that changes a little this is the $900 redmi Champion Edition and bear in mind $900 is a pretty Monumental cost for a company who sells most of their phones at like 400 or less the Sim ejector is a little Bland but I like the carbon fiber style backing oh and the case is nice too if I had to guess I would say that car company cases are like the most faked type of case so it's called to see an official one which is designed to have the same finish as a steering wheel apparently I've just realized even all the pull tabs are also custom shaped to match Lamborghini's sharp design language there's a charger underneath also branded and 120 WS it's very nippy then the smartphone and the cable beneath that [Music] oh oh wow now to be completely real with you I personally find Lamborghini cars pretty disappointing I don't own one hell no but I've done these like driving experiences and every time I do one I'm constantly surprised at how poor the technology is within what's meant to be a super car like genuinely a Hyundai at a 20th of the price has better Tech that said the Aesthetics of Lamborghinis are Dro worthy and this seems seems to be mostly borrowing that which makes it in my books the nicest looking and feeling redmi phone I have ever held in my hands and the actual Lamborghini logo looks like real gold even though it probably isn't there's so much detail in the top section and then the bottom section mirrors that same Lamborghini style Chevron but even the lanyard has the same Chevron and then you use that Chevron to place it within the case so that when the phone is on top of it the lanyard completely supports its weight pretty neat brand integration it's literally you versus the guy she tells you not to worry about see the boot wa I see the appeal of that I guess you could also say that this has Lambo performance too this might genuinely be the most spec out phone I've ever held in my hands Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip 24 GB of lpddr 5x Ram 1 terab of ufs 4.0 storage 5,000 mAh battery 120 w super fast charging some part of me is thinking should I switch to this It also says the display goes up to 4,000 nits of brightness my s24 ultra is rated at 2,600 although I wouldn't take that to mean that this display is 40% Brighter Than This display it's basically just because the way that Peak brightness numbers are measured can be very specific use case so you can't apply those numbers to the general use of the phone the software skin is actually kind of cool everything is hexagonal but at the same time how did not one person involved in this look at this weather widget and think yeah maybe just at the very least let's not include that on the default home screen I'm kind of curious how do the cameras on this compared to the cameras on my phone if they are actually better than I might just do this let's give it a go I'm actually not sure tell you what I'm going to put these two images on screen you guys tell me which one you think is better maybe I will switch now just before we get to the biggest limited edition thing that I've ever opened let's take a look at the most expensive phone so you saw the $900 Lamborghini phone right but what can Porsche cook up with honor for over three times that price you can really tell that you're opening something expensive This Time Around by the sheer volume of packaging oh they couldn't have made a non-stick label seriously honor okay we're in so this is a stylus I do appreciate how it's included in the Box it makes a big difference when an accessory is the default option but wow does this company not know how to use sticky the phone feels really really light but we'll get to that oh three boxes underneath I like the look of this middle one so that is a Porsche Design Sim ejector and inside is a beautiful looking case yes please looks like the same stitching that you get in the seats of a Porsche what's this I think it's a pen case wow it really is beautiful though it's really hard to communicate the quality to through the camera but it feels designer also pretty slick how every single accessory so far is matte black I I feel like I'm unboxing a full in theme EDC kit even these throwaway inserts they're not like plain cardboard texture it feels like the real deal okay the cable is pretty standard and the charger oh my God that's three times now it's definitely not me but yeah the Charger looks pretty basic too so what's in here oh it's the same thing so cable and then power brick Oh but this one's a UK power brick instead of Euro well there are definitely much more efficient ways to give you both options but hey I guess at $3,000 they just do not care they're just pretty happy to throw stuff at you four times four times honor what are you doing so this is the iconic Porsche fly line this kind of swooshing Ridge shape that you get along the panels of their cars the camera module is designed to look like a Porsche windshield and the color is Porsche's Agate gray I mean I can kind of buy it like if you're a real fan of their cars then seeing that exact shade of gray on their phone maybe but to me gray is just Gray you'd really have to know to know and this iconic fly line they talk up so much it doesn't really look much different to the ridge on the Lamborghini phone or really any other Ridge I've seen it all just feels a little bit trivial it's like we partnered with legendary carmaker Porsche to create a crease on the back of our phone that said the design is not just for show this phone as well as titanium lettering in the camera also has a super light titanium hinge and to give them credit it is shockingly slim and light this is 234 G that's less than the weight of an iPhone 14 pro Max but that is wild for a folding phone with literally two times the screen area and this software skin actually feels very sophisticated compared to the ones we've tested before they haven't themed every single icon but because the theming itself is so subtle it doesn't look like a mess also both screens just generally look and feel really responsive and bright and colorful the stylus feels amazing it's actually quite nice cuz it's got a rubberized tip and I've been really used to using the apple pencil and every time you touch the screen with that it feels like you're hitting it I got to hand it to them it's a really polished system and I love the fact that the pen works on both the inner screen and the outer screen you know this is actually the first time I'm using a stylist that I genuinely think Rivals the iPad with the apple pencil only thing is because of this rubberized tip it actually creates a little bit of resistance when you're writing so you have to push a little bit harder but this is a sports car class fiberglass body which is cool in that fiberglass is much stronger than normal glass but at the same time fiberglass is basically just reinforced plastic so I wonder if it actually scratches easier I hate the fact that I have to do this I bought this with my own money but science sometimes I am my own biggest problem so what we want is Mo's hardness pick level six because this will do basically nothing to the back of iPhone's glass but now let's try the Porsche Design well why am I like this why am I like this yeah that's pretty rough oh no I wanted it to survive that well okay now we're at it even the screen is meant to be something quite different this is Honor's antiscratch nanoc Crystal Shield they're basically saying that partly thanks to a film of silicon nitride which fittingly is actually a material used in real car engines this will stay as good as new even without a protective film with 10 times more wear and drop existant versus competitors which I mean if they actually deliver on that is like all I've ever been asking for on a phone so let's flip them over right so we'll start with level seven this time so on the iPhone doesn't really do much to be honest okay so now the honor oh okay nothing at all so let's try level eight so far I haven't used a single phone that hasn't been damaged by level eight so iPhone yikes okay that carved right through it and now honor okay okay there is damage but it's quite a bit lighter than it was on the iPhone so I guess silicum nitroid works we got to see more companies trying this oh yeah there's one thing this phone can apparently do that I've been really wanting to try it's meant to be able to detect motion and capture automatically I pop this up here and then let's see I just jump in the [Music] air it literally captured me toppling over at the end I think the feature needs some work I think this is such an interesting limited edition though 9 out of 10 time for the big boy box this is something we've never seen before on this series a limited edition fullon gaming PC so this is based off evangelion's unit 2 Evangelion is a show all about people piloting meccas to defeat enemies who threaten Humanity called angels and this Mecca is piloted by one of the main characters Asuka wow I don't even know where to start I feel like very few people get to actually go Hands-On with something like this you can see Rog branding across the sides because this was actually made in collaboration between Asus Republic of Gamers and overclockers UK and I just can't quite believe the quality of finish this is cool Tech but also the really cool thing about having a custom gaming PC is it's not just the PC C it's like everything on the inside like I'm just peeking my head in but I can already see so many references to evangelon to Asuka to her specific Mecca W it looks like a crystal etched LED lit kind of backing they've done the entire power supply enclosure the graphics card the graphics card itself is custom evangelon this is one of the coolest pieces of Technology I've ever interacted with but also when have you ever seen a CPU coer with an actual LCD display on it so it's giving you all sorts of different system readings like CPU temperature GPU temperature the current clock speed as well I mean in a way it's incredibly pointless because all of these stats are already communicated internally anyway but you can also use the screen to display an infinitely looping GIF I'm just putting that out there not that I have any plans of what I would infinitely Loop I've also never seen a power supply that actively in real time displays the current wattage being supplied also 188 Watts for an idle PC is quite a large amount I feel like can't look at a single part of this PC and not see a reference to the show like even the back plate over here reminds me of the metal armor plating of the mecca oh yeah they've also braided every single cable red and black it's also actually wild how girthy graphics cards become like this GPU Riser here I'm pretty sure is the only thing keeping this upright it even extends to the outside of the case this is a magnetically attachable external Wi-Fi antenna for the Wi-Fi 6E that it has but let's see what it can do because the specs are redonkulous like I'm talking 14th gen Intel Core I9 with a boost speed of up to 6 GHz 32 gigs of ddr5 RAM 2 tbte M2 mvme SSD oh yeah and the custom Nvidia GeForce RTX 490 graphics card this is the creme DOA Creme of current gen performance okay so we're in cyberpunk 2077 and this is a fun bit because I'm not going to go low medium high or Ultra I am going to go into overdrive wow those fans really work I wonder what the wattage is right now 643 WTS haven't even clicked play yet holy cow oh this this is something else it's like like I've seen really impressive graphics on games before but this is like that but then with another cinematic layer on top it's got really high quality motion blur like every time I run I feel like in one of those high octane fight sequences but also the lighting everything has this really subtle soft glow I've never actually played cyberpunk myself cuz the bugs would apparently so bad but this really makes me want to give it a shot the fact that I can crank the settings to these kinds of levels and not even worry about performance wow I hope you found this as cool as I did I'll link you to the next rarest Tech video around there see you there"

world's biggest celebrities everything from smart watches that replace your smartphone to microphones that make you sing better to Cyclone powerered popcorn machines so have these celebrities used their special talents to make something genuinely amazing or have they actually just abused their Fame to sell you a load of hot garbage time to find out with our lovely homemade ratings chart and let's actually go in order of how famous the person is starting with Will I Am who already has a very respectable 1.6 million Instagram followers and he has made a smartwatch called the dial holy cow this packaging is amazing it looks like a floor standing speaker and here is the watch why does it look like a handcuff now the key selling point here is that this thing has full smartphone functionality and it runs on a voice activated oper ow it's got such a strong magnet it just ripped off my arm it runs off a voice activated operating system called an needer like I needer un Ely I need a network connection to help you first name I need a second name connection the actual interface is fine enough I guess it looks somewhat slick and like a smart watch but it's pretty clear the core functionality rests on it communicating with some sort of server that I am pretty certain the dude's just taken down to be fair the quality isn't terrible for a watch camera it's just the colors need some work I look like a Simpson I'm honestly not surprised it barely works to be honest it it looks like it doesn't even listen to Will I Am himself let's talk about music do you feel like eating but before we decide how low will he go on our beautiful scoreboard we've got two more products from the guy first the super mask designed I guess to be the Batman utility belt of face masks okay so it's got a silicon seal that goes over your nose it's got LED lights on the outside two three-speed ventilation fans and noise cancelling bluetooth earbuds that magnetically dock onto the mask when not in use to broadcast your ear wax to the people sitting on either side of you there's a slightly bigger problem here this mask is on its tightest setting right now the one product where it's absolutely vital that you create a complete seal and yet there were two different sizes there was small medium and then medium large but between those two options I'm firmly in the camp of medium large Joseph can I just check I'm not being an idiot here course so that's the tightest possible setting yes see if it fits [Music] you no in the nicest way possible how large would you say your head is uh all my loved ones in my entire life I said have got a fat head I always go for the extra large and the minimal padding in helmets if you wore the straps higher up then does it fit no cuz then you got a massive Gap here how do they make a face mask that doesn't mask your face I'm starting to get the feeling that everyone's favorite pandemic doctor will I am doesn't completely think things through and finally we've got his earphones called the buttons which unlike basically every single other set of earphones that do everything they can to hide themselves these are designed to like the buttons on your clothing specifically be on show they're meant to be the way for you to show the world you love music by looking a lot like vinyl records which also happen to snap together with magnets dude what is it with this guy and the insistence on showing people the insides of your ears so will I am is is not so bril I am I'm going to give you a three mostly for the effort oh wow this this one looks a lot more budget than I was expecting it to this is the IMT pain microphone and it's oh it's packaged in that horrible sharp plastic I guess so you can really feel with te pain but this is actually a pretty cool product idea because even if you have no idea who Tain is I think there's a pretty good chance that you've heard tain's voice at some point it is famously autotuned like so autotuned that I have no idea what he sounds like without the autotune and so this can apparently give that power to you oh God I hate this although I'm actually the perfect candidate to test this with because I cannot sing so there's a record button [Music] here now click play okay interesting it's time to whip it out what I'm actually really upset that you're going to hear my before singing as well as my after we've known each other for so long this a big moment right here play we've known each other for so long I will take that that's the first time I've ever heard myself singing where I don't want to run and hide myself under my bed in silence for the next week there's another button here which apparently allows you to drop a dirty background track [Music] we've known each other for so long all right we've known each other for so long you know what I actually like it no one would ever use this to record real music but it's a lot of fun and then when you're done press these two buttons pull that off and this is a USB port so you can download to your computer the files of you singing so this is the trailer for The Product hey knock off that racket I will turn this car around everything sounds better with the IMT pain mic you kids now play Boom hey still noise one button te pain effect I am T and I approve this me so it's not just for performances this is also a child discipline tool t p is a marketing genius so Mr Tay not a professional piece of equipment but does what it says on the tin which is more than we can say for some 5 out of 10 all the way up at 7.1 million Instagram followers now we've got Fernando Alonso who depending on what you're into is either going to be a massive deal or you have no idea who I'm talking about Alonso is a Spanish Formula 1 World Champion currently driving for Aston Martin but I love how he's put carting world champion before F1 in his bio guy's got his priorities straight and so what he's done is built a Lifestyle brand called kimoa off the back of his racing career and in what might be the most fitting product for a Formula 1 racing driver to make this is their version of an e scooter at kimoa we believe that life perseveres within regardless of what occurs externally this is why we love the Sun the Sea and the light because they reflect a way of being just as the sun rises internally each day tell me you've used chat gbt without telling me you've used chat gbt doesn't exactly scream unique products that have had lots of love put into them though I do have an idea of where we can test this we'll get to it oh this one's fun so for some baffling reason soundcloud's Golden Boy rapper Soldier Boy you know this guy started selling his own video game consoles in 2018 and the Pinnacle of them released in 2021 was supposed to be the solder boy game get it I think these are the cheapest feeling earphones I've ever held I remember the guy's Twitter marketing at the time this thing wasn't just being sold as a knockoff Game Boy it was advertised with a 3.5 in touchscreen Netflix Spotify and apple music right out the box and it was supposedly going to have some huge big brand big budget games including fortnite and Call of Duty long story short it became pretty clear that the legendary soldja boy game was actually just an existing gaming handheld called the trdr pocket but in red and after it turned out that it was a scam and basically no one who bought one seemed to receive one Soulja Boy then started promising those buyers that they would instead get an upgraded model with AI that was now worth $400 and this is that oh God this thing is so reflective not a good choice of finish for a gaming console so it runs Android which means oh no the Call of Duty and the fortnite games he's promised to people they're just the mobile games aren't they it doesn't even meet the minimum requirements to run fortnite fortnite on a phone does not have very high minimum requirements uh it plays the emulator okay it's not like the best visual or frame rate experience but it's it's not bad as an emulator the thing has no shoulder buttons how am I meant to drift without shoulder buttons okay forget that let's test the AI the supposedly lifechanging AI That's the sole reason this thing's price was increased from $200 to $400 hi Scarlet what's the weather tell me anything tell me anything useful it crashed maybe I can ask it to drift for me in racing game since I have no shoulder buttons this whole thing is just absolutely terrible every angle of this sucks it's Android 11 so it's 4 years out of date I have doubts about the update schedule on this device oh and I really love this Personal Touch he's added to the side of the console he's angled the power button 80° off from where it normally is what a guy does it not also look like one of those devices use in hospitals to bring people back to life like except this might actually be the thing that kills me okay so this is Call of Duty mobile none of the controls work so settings oh my God the res ution of the screen is so poor I can barely read the text in the menus it's just such a lazy product they haven't done like the base layer of programming required to make these controls detectable in most games well I guess what soldja boy said was true in life you either Crank that soldja boy or he cranks you and we're the ones you got cranked here you get a very prestigious zero out of 10 not even on the board okay we are in the tens of millions at this point I think it's pretty fair to say that anyone Beyond this point is like world famous starting with Harry Kane who's kind of a football legend this guy scored 66 goals in his 98 International appearances making him the highest goal scorer ever for England and basically meaning that in any given game he is more likely to score than to not score which feels like a wild statistic so with all his Goodwill Kane has recently launched his own brand of sustainable Electronics called our Pure Planet there's like a hundred things here from them I'm going to pick one of them let's review the speaker I got to say Kane this website feels completely dead very much like some eagle-eyed business person has seen some well-priced generic Tech from China they want to drop ship it to wealthy westerners but then realized they needed a name to push it so he said hey Harry can we borrow you for a day to do a photo shoot with them I mean every single one of these photos is shot with Harry Kane in one of two outfits so I'm now thinking 2hour photo shoot Max you know what's making me think this is it's just the fact that these products look so soulless they have no identity or consistency Beyond just this one logo so I guess if these have been designed from scratch then Harry buddy you got to get yourself a new designer oh no that is the epitome of generic startup sounds it's like they picked from the generic speaker bingo card this is just so lazy I can't believe it I don't know if you're going to get Harry Kane have him say Bluetooth mode on it would add some value have you heard him speak well I've not seen the pen back but from my point of view do look like [Music] okay so you've got one set of speakers facing this way one set facing this way so you have some directional audio it doesn't sound terrible but at the same time I have heard $30 speakers that have more detail than this nothing about this Tech feels at all worth $130 I guess the only saving grace is how much you value the sustainability they say that every single speaker is 100% carbon neutral and 200% plastic regenerative but there's always an asterisk with these things no one is saving the planet by buying speakers if you actually care about sustainability buy a used one on eBay so boring product not very good for the price you sir have earned yourself a four at 18 million followers well before he got suspended and then eventually deactivated his Instagram account it's Kanye West or I guess yay nowadays and his stem player speaker now we have actually covered one of these before in one of our gadgets videos but I think this thing is fascinating it looks like an alien it feels like a bag of skin but hidden inside is actually an artificial intelligence that can take any song and break it down into its various different stems like the Baseline drums vocals Etc allowing you to control each one of them on the Fly power it on it's actually such a cool looking product so I'm playing a song right now and you can see in real time stripping out the various individual elements so that right there is the drums that's the melody it does feel just a little bit like magic the problem though is well a it's not a good sounding speaker considering the price you pay for it it actually makes Harry kanes look like good value oh and also the only way to load music onto it is to use the stem player website which processes the track and then you have to download it and put it onto your stem player manually pretty much immediately relegating this to cool toy that you probably won't use so I was thinking a six just because of how cool the thing is but minus one point for trying to make his d 2 album exclusive to the stem player effectively charging people $200 just to listen to it now from someone who well still has Instagram it's the actress Drew Barrymore and this lady has done a lot you know the little girl in the ET movie that's her host of her own talk show that's her one of Charlie's Angels yeah still her and now add to that list owner of the company Beautiful by Drew who made this popcorn machine I got to say though not the highest quality better kit it feels like most celebrity products by default go specifically for luxury whereas this feels quite light and cheap which is fair enough it's only $34 but I guess I don't think you'll find this proudly displayed in Drew Barrymore's kitchen as her pride and joy so one measure of popcorn goes in there I actually skipped dessert today so this is kind of perfect and this also now apparently doubles as a butter melting tray yes please oh wow okay we're cooking with gas oh my goodness you can see the cyclone in action the seeds are actually rotating and this is actually the air fryer of popcorn machines I guess because instead of oil it uses cyclonic airflow technology which is the same principle that dys and fans use supposedly to maintain even cooking temperature throughout it's definitely not an immediate process it is oh wait wait uh Joseph this is smoking oh God okay I'm going to turn that off wow I think we got it working again wait why is it why is the entire thing put it in butter I wanted that on my popcorn not my machine all right we're smoking up again on the inside I'm going to call it there well I got to say pretty terrible impression of this product so far none of it has reached my bowl oh God still smells good I'll give it that melted butter oh wo then actually little top tip for homemade popcorn cinnamon butter and sugar add some of that on top all right Drew give me like five bu Mor cheers that was delicious but I take 100% of the credit that was not delicious because of Drew Barrymore and her cheaply made oil covered Transformer destroying half cooking popcorn machine drewberry 4 no two Barry more Hillary Duff is up next actress singer author and businesswoman with 26.9 million followers so she is officially ahead of our YouTube channel which I'm sure she's had a big celebration about watch out though I might just have to build world's largest Hillary Duff and her company below 60 has built their own Cent diffuser and I thought this was interesting below 60 isn't referring to degrees of temperature instead it refers to 60° south of the Equator a Latitude that encompasses only ocean near Antarctica which is supposedly where the freshest air on Earth is the website says this thing redefines fragrance design with the following features oh yeah so there's a magnet on the plug and the fragrance just snaps in place although it is leaking I mean the one job of a container is to stop it doing that okay adjustable horizontal and vertical plug so you can just take this and snap it into two different orientations which I have to say is kind of a genius idea cuz like because the scenter diffuser is kind of thick you'll want to be able to rotate it away from the plug next to it just so it doesn't obstruct it and then fragrance strength control well that's a bit of a stretch it's got high low and off so there's three different scents there's if Citrus were a feeling it's got like orange and lime and Sandalwood and spices mint disco on ice smells like a spa mixed with a candy shop so good vanilla buys a time share in Paradise H that's like a panina colada it's nice okay so the scents are like addictively good the only question on my mind is is this actually any better than a cheaper simpler and frankly more aesthetic pleasing readed diffuser in theory this is meant to gently warm your fragrances to encourage evaporation but let's come back later to find out if that's true or not Olivia Rodrigo a name you probably never heard a few years ago and now you can't stop hearing about with 37.8 million followers has collaborated with Sony to design her version of the link buds which feels like a pretty off thee beaten path cultured choice or you know Sony offered her a bucket load of cash so this whole purple exteror is her signature color U but to be very honest I don't think she's done a very good job with it maybe it was meant to look pearlescent and like a piece of jewelry but to me it just looks like a used pencil erazor at least it is using recycled materials cuz like you can tell one thing though that I think is really cool and might be able to save it is two custom sound profiles tuned by Rodrigo and her producer for the optimal listening experience of her albums guts and sour and I guess there is something really cool about knowing that you're getting the exact same audio experience that she's had and that she endorses for her own music let's give it a go so right now I'm listening to her sour album without the sour sound profile H I would say the earphones sound pretty good but they're a little bit flat they don't have the base response that I would want and also I think part of it is on her album I think it's not recorded in the best environment for optimal listening you know there's some artists who when you listen to their tracks on really good earphones you just know that they've obsessed over recording the track right let's switch over to the sour sound profile H okay I changed my mind it's actually kind of lazy they both sound basically the same as each other and they both sound almost the same as just the flat neutral sound profile so I guess the idea is cool but it's not enough to make it a unique proposition nor is it enough to make not so great earphones sound amazing so I would say it's not a scandal but she's taken a pretty mediocre product and to be honest with this design she's actually made it slightly worse so I think you can have a four wow this is actually a really poor show is anyone even going to reach the upper half now just before we get to the top three celebrities the ones with hundreds of millions of followers turns out that Will Smith is actually the global Ambassador for insta 360 this video sponsor and they have absolutely nailed it with their new X4 camera for two reasons one you know that famous bending over backward scene from The Matrix movie well they use no fewer than 120 photo cameras all around to capture every single angle equipment totaling well over $200,000 the insta 360 X4 allows you to achieve the same bullet time effect with one camera and it records that at 5.7k resolution but there is more so we give this a little Kickstart to get it going and then pull down the trigger oh oh oh oh my God Fernando uh-oh uh-oh how do you stare this how do you steare this okay abandon two the the whole benefit of 360 cameras is that they record every single angle at once so you never miss anything the downside is that this often adds an extra step cuz you might want to go through and tweak which way the camera is looking at every single point but now you don't even have to do that anymore because the AI editing will do it for you in seconds so check out the link in the description for the insta 360x 4 a 10% discount a free bullet time handle and an invisible selfie stick so the scooter is it's fun I think this is me realizing that I really like E Scooters as opposed to I really like Alonzo's product it's pretty standard like I mean there's a light which we've seen a lot of very bright flashlights on this channel this isn't really one of them and there's just not many bells and whistles to it except that one but it's got a kick oh no ram ram I think you can have our first ever six out of 10 right we're in the big leagues now with 121 million followers It's Real Madrid footballer Killian mbappe and he has also released a portable speaker but this one's very promising with 100 watts of Music power compared to I'd guess the 30 watts of Harry Kane speaker and the three watts of the speakers inside your phone holy moly the color on this thing a slightly hilarious attempt at branding on their website inspired by the sporting achievements of football star Killian mbappe we've made a speaker I mean the guy's a fantastic dribbler but how did you get to speaker from there this one is pretty exciting because the company that manufactures it is called L they're a luxury Speaker Company they have a normal Bluetooth speaker which cost 99 but then with mbappe they've worked together to design the pro which is 249 so are we being scammed or has Killian gone and scored oh this is actually super unique there's a touch bar on the actual body of the speaker that allows you to adjust the volume the base and the treble although do they not think to put a slightly brighter LED on the inside considering you can see the rest of the speaker from the moon so let's take it for a spin oh okay you really feel the the thump that comes with 100 watts of amplification here your base is going up now going all the way God uh okay so this is a good powerful speaker but it's exactly what it looks like you know when you see this Basse slider that you can adjust to some infinite degree it makes you think that it's going to be one of those speakers like the dvla Phantom that I tested a while ago that can just completely defy its Dimensions this is not that when you dial up the bass it literally just tweaks a software setting that adds in more base at the cost of everything else and it sounds kind of Muddy adjusting The Equalizer with your music is not some sort of magic trick that makes music sound better and that's all this is really but you know decent sound it's water and temperature resistant it's got 24-hour battery life it doubles as a power bank and well you're not going to lose it all right G on then 6 out of 10 basically just for doing what you say on the tin number two then is none other than Kim Kardashian we're now at levels of Fame that I don't even understand like how does one even start to get 361 million Instagram followers but anyway she has worked together with Beats by Dre to create her own custom version of The Studio Pros so she's launched this in three colors all personally curated by her called Moon Dune and Earth what is up with Kim Kardashian trying to turn the entire world flesh toned actually can't decide if I like it or not it makes it look and feel very premium but at the same time time it makes me feel like I'm carrying around a bag of foundation wherever I go and then you've also got this custom cable which weaves together the Fabrics of all three of the colors she's made so that they only have to make one cable for all three products let's give him a listen I actually haven't tested beats in a while but these are not the products they used to be they're actually easily the best sounding audio products in this entire video but don't get too excited nothing's been over a six so obviously Kim Kardashian didn't make beats but she pck a good product to partner with and she made it look better for some people so congratulations Kim you're the proud recipient of a s out of 10 oh wa that is nice not subtle at all and I love it oh yeah it's definitely warmed up which is just going to accelerate the natural evaporation process only thing that how on Earth are we already like halfway through the fragrance like when I bought this reed diffuser this was full to the brim with fragrance so that's like 10 times the volume of this little cartridge so I guess it's here for a good time not a long time yeah I could see this becoming a very expensive hobby to keep fueling but she's made her own company it's not a Rebrand of someone else's product and it does what it says on the tin better than basically any other scent diffuser I've tried so you can have a high eight not a dff you want to know who we have at the very top though it's well arguably the most famous person on the planet Cristiano Ronaldo who also happens to be the co-founder and face of consumer electronics brand Rock and also now the fastest growing YouTube channel of all time what does this say rock is more than my brand it's a reflection of my mission to live life loud okay so he's all in on this apparently and these are his earphones and so what kind of earphones does the most famous person on the planet use well I hope he uses his own earphones it'd be pretty funny if he's actually just an airpods guy although oh my goodness me this is Photoshop you can very clearly see that the earphones have been added into the image afterwards I don't think there's a single photo of him actually using these this looks like a render too well that's not a good start okay the fit is secure thanks to these fins that kind of Lodge themselves in your ears that makes sense he plays football he doesn't want them to fall out while he's running oh man that's not the best really is it this is like this is the definition of fine the thing is right it's not expensive to make decent in earphones and that is all these are they're just very Baseline in quality like even though these are priced at like $130 $140 I'm genuinely thinking $7 manufacturing cost there's nothing about the sound or the feel or the technology on offer here that makes it any more sophisticated than that they did also say that this cable has Kevlar embedded inside of it which you shouldn't be able to cut very easily sorry Ronaldo it was Zero resistance so the product works it's just grossly overpriced for what it is and also kind of misleading with the way it's marketed two out of 10 there of an own gold that one so there you have it this video was a little different so let me know if you liked it and if you want to see a followup with YouTuber products"

connor']",PT1H6M8S,6417738,9572,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)'],True,"this week I thought it would be interesting to throw away my modern tech products and see what it would be like to strictly use vintage Tech in the Modern [Applause] Age folks I've been alive for almost 30 years and in that time I've seen a lot of technological advancements for example when I was a kid I had to download music song by song on Lime wire and just pray to God that the virus I get wasn't too bad this time dude I couldn't even use my computer or the home phone at the same time because we had dial up internet and freaking nowadays you can talk to someone on the phone while using that same phone to generate a picture of a PS2 made out of human skin the future is now and the tech that's coming out today is obviously pretty mind-blowing the VR space for example is getting crazier and crazier the Apple Vision Pro just came out and people have been losing their minds about it and rightfully so because with the Apple Vision Pro you can finally know the answer to that age-old question what would it feel like to stand on the moon and look out into the vastness of space and jerk off that's one small Edge for man one giant goon for mankind not to mention the world of AI has come a very long way since I made a video about AI generated art a few years ago open AI just teased their text to video project called sora which is by far the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life if you haven't seen it all you have to do is type in a prompt and it provides you with an insanely realistic video that really does not look like AI at at all stock video services and video production companies are going to be absolutely cooked in the next few years and I'm really nervous for the future of entertainment but I mean you can't deny how impressive that technology is right with something like Sora you could generate virtually anything finally get to see what it looks like if someone was standing on the surface of the Moon and jerking off but the interesting about tech is that it's all relative to when it comes out sure all of this is impressive now but 20 years from now we're going to be looking back at this laughing same as today when you look at an old laptop you're like this piece of  can barely run anything but at the time of the laptop's release people were losing their minds about it a computer I can fold in half only it didn't cost my entire yearly salary of $100 I think the tech industry is kind of like a southern man's sexual escapades it's all relative and I hate to sound like a boomer but I often miss the Simplicity and innocence of the tech that I grew up with back when having millions of songs readily available to play Whenever seemed like a fantasy because I could only play 30 second clips of a song at a time off of my hit Clips player coming at your right between the ears of hit Clips so this week I thought it would be interesting to throw away my modern tech products and see what it would be like to strictly use vintage Tech in the Modern Age and I've seen some of these videos before they use a flip phone and a Walkman they call it a day I don't want to do that that's too easy so I'm going to track down the weirdest most obscure vintage Tech products I can find and see what it's like to use them in the year 2024 so strap in and get ready for some weird vintage Tech so transparently the main problem I'm facing right now in my life is iPad baby syndrome I think we caught it early enough where it's treatable but I think it's still a big issue in my life I I  I can't stop scrolling dude I don't I know I'm not supposed to but it's tough call me crazy I love watching silly little videos okay and so do you you're literally watching one right now you know it got me thinking maybe making this video can help me kick my addiction to watching silly little videos is what I would say if I was a  loser the real question I need to ask myself is how can I still get my fix of watching silly little videos while using vintage technology I used to have a thing called a video now when I was a kid I would watch the same episode of SpongeBob over and over again on a tiny screen in black and white because that was the only disc I ever had for it and I'm not about to put myself through that again but upon further research I stumbled upon the perfect product for my little video fix a Casio analog handheld TV and I know what you're thinking you're thinking hold on didn't they stop broadcasting analog TV stations a little bit ago and the answer to that is yes they did in America but up here in Canada it is apparently still possible to get an analog TV signal first came the pocket watch then the pocket radio then even a pocket camera but who would have ever thought of a pocket TV Casio of course Casio that's it we're crazy we'll make anything dude we made a wristwatch that can kill God the pocket TV by CIO this TV is smaller lighter sharper and brighter yeah this seems pretty awesome I've never used a portable TV but I assume it relies on like a strong signal to to work like at length so I imagine back in the day using one of these like while you're on the go was like next to Impossible stop the bus stop the bus right now okay okay okay it's stop now put it in reverse okay okay okay keep going and stop stop stop right there all right I'm stop [Music] perfect oh man I love Bill Cosby he can do no wrong but I found a portable TV on eBay I got it for my next vintage tech product I was thinking about the other things we do on our phones aside from just watching videos and that's when I remembered the three humongous camera lenses on the back of my phone I got to find a camera and not just any camera okay one that I can easily take with me wherever I go and one that can also show me the pictures as soon as I take them and that second feature is the thing that made finding this product especially difficult I looked at some Polaroid cameras I was toying with that idea I used to have one called an eyes Zone when I was a kid that looked like a  stapler and I loved that thing I was going to get that one for Old Time sake but then I stumbled upon the perfect product it was released in 2001 by those crazy unhinged Lawless depraved bastards over at Casio and it's called the Casio RIS camera I can't find any commercials for this unfortunately the only ad I could find was on eBay someone who's like listing this magazine ad for sale for some reason time for your little black book to grow up Julie and there's her phone number there you got Suzie double jointed Pam loves football Debbie from Dallas the Casio digital wrist camera watch you're out having a good time then you point your Casio digital wrist camera watch and click a few black and white phot photos of a girl you dig no you don't hold on no you don't you shouldn't do that but you don't want to use all 100 images on one girl type in her name number and other info so that you can give her a ring later then download the images to your PC with the free PC link kit you can also upload those images to your pocket PC or or Pal with our free software available at casio.com pretty cool for $199.95 Digital Risk camera that also tells time holy interesting marketing tactic I'll give you that yeah I think that'll work out really well ladies just imagine you're at the club partying drinking with your girlfriends you're having a great night and then some guy walks up to you with his  007 spy watch and snaps pictures of all your faces but not only that he uploads them immediately to his  pocket PC where you'll join his extensive database full of hundreds of other random women he's seen and they say chivalry is dead I also love the last line pretty cool for A2 $ digital rist camera that also tells time like yeah it better tell time it would be wild if you were wearing one of these watches and it didn't even do the main thing that a watch is supposed to do hey man you got the time yeah man for sure uh it's about quarter to Rebecca awesome thanks dude hey is that a Cassio no this is a Cassie oh and I actually found one of these wrist cameras on eBay so that's right wrist camera secure full transparency this video started out as uh me trying out weird as scen On TV products which I honestly might still do so if you guys want to see that video leave a but the as scen on TV product that spawned this video is a little device called my little reminder if you were around my age you probably saw this commercial a million times especially when you stayed home sick from school because this dominated the daytime commercials dude it was the Everest College guy yelling at me pick up the phone and make the call why are you making it complicated and then this commercial where did I park my car oh no okay terrific line delivery where did I park my car oh no it's called My Little reminder the digital voice recorder that records without take blue section Row 18 then reminds you later blue section Row 18 okay I see how that could be helpful I guess but I feel like if your memory is that bad uh you should be in a home like your own home or a retirement home you shouldn't leave like if you can't remember that there's going to be a lot of other you can't remember too then you also have to remember what kind of car you have you got to remember where you live you got to remember how to get where you live I imagine her purse is just full of my little reminders each telling her a separate detail about her life milk juice butter and eggs then play back your reminder when it's time I guess she clearly needed the reminder because all she needed was oh I forgot already too she needed the reminder cuz all she needed was milk juice butter and eggs and then you look at her grocery cart she already Rogue and bought a bunch of other she didn't need that's left on Main Street then go 2 miles and right on own yeah cuz that's how we got around before you know GPS Google Maps and everything and the voice recordings are pretty short on it so if you're going for like a really long drive you got to talk like super fast Drive North on Main Street for 2 miles and left that University and follow that for 4 and half miles and merge onto the 4 Highway going Westbound and stay on that until your car out of gas okay yeah so it's just a glorified voice recorder where you can record little messages and you can play later to REM yourself of things but also for some reason it has a flashlight my little reminder even has a built-in LED flashlight just in case you forgot to remind yourself to pack a flashlight and I'm actually a really forgetful person so I'm really excited to try this out because oh yeah I got one I got my little reminder let's actually give it a try really quick don't forget to do the brand deal oh yeah thank you to Opera for sponsoring this video folks I know it's easy to just stick with the same browser you've been using for years but it gets better Opera is faster smarter harder and safer than your default browser Opera comes chalk full of features as well like Arya for example Opera's native browser AI it's easily accessible in the sidebar at all times and if you need help with anything at all then help is right at your fingertips I always struggle with coming up with titles for my videos and Arya is perfect for giving me a little nudge in the in the right direction and I've always thought that navigating other browsers can get confusing really quick especially for me when I'm researching like several things at once it can get messy and out of control but with Opera's tab Islands it automatically organizes your tabs and you can collapse certain Islands to save space it's such a simple feature but it honestly might be my favorite part about Opera it's so useful and it makes browsing and organizing practically effortless I think security is also something we should all be taking into consideration and with Opera you get a builtin VPN service totally free and unlimited so you can browse the internet privately and I don't know about you guys but I'm on the go pretty often I travel a lot so a ton of work that I do is on my laptop and sometimes my battery is getting drained way tooo fast that's why I love Opera's battery saver option it's activated with just one simple click and it allows me to browse up to one hour longer think about how many fart sound effects I can add with that much time folks this is a no-brainer Opera is the better browser in every way you can move over all the information from your old browser in just minutes what the heck are you waiting for use my link below to download Opera today you won't regret it I promise you that okay thank you again to Opera for sponsoring this video back to me the other feature of my phone that I wanted to try and replicate with vintage Tech was the uh phone like actually calling people I often forget my phone is a phone sometimes but that's too easy you know phones have been around forever I wanted to replicate FaceTime I FaceTime people all the time and it's something that I would like to continue to do with vintage Tech but let me just say this finding a product that could do this was very difficult upon doing a little bit of research I found out that the first video call ever actually took place all the way back in 1970 by AT&T who subsequently launched the first first video phone service with 38 picture phones as they called them located at eight different companies located in Pittsburgh kind of ruins the entire appeal of video calling if all the phones are just within the same city but still you know it was pretty cool it was the 70s they don't know what was going on and due to how expensive and complicated those early picture phones were the 70s and ' 80s saw no real success with this technology but in 1992 AT&T swung for the fences they took another whack at it and released the AT&T Video Phone 2500 for a retail price of $1500 adjusted for inflation that's about $2800 in today dollar so this was a luxury product for sure Tech Bros didn't fully exist yet but if MKBHD was making videos back then his review would have crushed and the release of this phone was met with mixed reviews upon its release people were impressed with the technology obviously but a lot of people were worried about the danger of video calling but some people want AT&T to voluntarily not sell any of the video phones to 900 sex line numbers you can just imagine unsupervised children being able to call a 900 number man you know when you watch a disaster movie and it's like the first half hour of the film when everybody's like having a good time laughing and enjoying themselves and in your head you're like honey you've got a big storm coming that's how I feel watching that clip but due to the lackluster sales numbers the AT&T Video Phone 2500 was discontinued in 1995 but I got one yeah and it only cost me $450 today dollar and that might seem a little expensive but when you compare it to the original price that's a steal now what's the other thing that we mainly use our phones for music you got Spotify Apple music SoundCloud title and many other services that allow us to listen to practically any song we want whenever we want but back in the day they only had a few ways to listen to music while they were on the go portable radio a cassette player a Walkman or a  boom box on your shoulder if you're a break dancer from an ' 80s movie but all that is boring honestly a little too cumbersome for me I want to be handsfree and I think I found the perfect product for me this product is called no joke the bone phone which is not a video phone sex line believe it or not the bone phone is an AM FM stereo radio that drapes around your neck like a scarf two speakers placed near your ears not only provide excellent stereo separation but vibrate slightly through your bones to give you the same sensation of standing in front of your home stereo system perfect it was released in 1979 didn't really catch on for obvious reasons but a modern reimagining of this product was actually released in 2019 by Sony there are a few of these for sale on eBay so I just ordered the cleanest one because a lot of them had like weird stains on them for some reason and usually if something vibrates and is CED in stains I try not to buy it that's like my one rule but I had to break it for this video I'm willing to uh to try it out bone phone secure and before I talk about the final product I figured I should order a practical device so I can still do work stuff like emails and whatnot so I ordered a Palm Pilot and no a Palm Pilot is not an astronaut jerking off on the moon for those of you who don't know pal Pilots or handhelds as they were called they were essentially smartphones before smartphones I wanted one as a kid like really bad because of this one joke in Max ke's big move I want my handheld you want me to hold your hand no hilarious handhelds usually come with a touchcreen and a stylist and you're able to do like tons of things on them mostly work related but we'll take a closer look at that later on in this video okay time for the last product I got and this is the this is the best one I think with the Apple Vision Pro coming out and wearable computers slowly becoming more popular in the mainstream I wanted to see if there was like a vintage equivalent to the Apple Vision Pro and by researching old wearable computer I found the craziest thing ever the cybernaut ma4 wearable computer holy cybernauts ma4 is the ultimate in Uber geek wear with all the autr mons this wearable PC weighs about 9 lb and allows you to compute anywhere the base unit consists of a 200 MHz pennium MMX with 128 megabytes Ram incase in a plastic shell that attaches to your waist the wrist mounted keyboard floppy Drive I got a floppy drive right here for battery pack and head-mounted display all plug into the shell the windin LCD reflects onto a semi-transparent 2-in reflective surface that projects the Windows desktop into your right eyes line of sight the unit runs all standard Windows apps and supports voice commands sure the price is steep but cybernaut includes a built-in camera that captures video to a land you'll laugh we did when you see yourself decked out in this Robo Weare but the thing actually works while we couldn't imagine actually using the ma4 for more than a minute even if we got one for free it could be useful in industrial situations such as sewer tunnels manufacturing plants and job training facilities okay nice really selling it guys and yeah this is $10,000 that's going to be like close to 20 grand for this thing now I also love how they were hyping up the product for 90% And the last 10% of this article they're like listen you look like a  ass loser you're going to look  and you probably won't be able to wear it for like more than a minute but it's kind of cool I don't know so this  crazy thing came out in 1999 and it looks straight out of The Matrix I can't believe this thing uh you got a keyboard on your arm that looks like a Yu-Gi-Oh dual dis you got a camera a microphone a screen that goes over your eye just imagine if this caught on you're walking into an up packed office building no desks just a bunch of dudes decked out in these things just standing in a huddle dude this is like my favorite time period for Tech products late '90s early 2000s was Peak cuz like the idea is were clearly there we're still trying to do this today but we were nowhere close in terms of technological advancements CU like personally I don't even think the Apple Vision Pro is worth it today CU just cuz it's huge and you need to carry a battery pack with you and  like I don't think the technolog is there yet and that's today they tried that 25 years ago too and there was actually like only one of these available on eBay in working condition so I'm really glad I secured it yeah cyber not secur and guys I read a lot about this thing cuz I was so fascinated by it so it was mainly used by people who work with their hands but still need need to access like important information like on the go so people like construction workers or even NASCAR pit Crews cybernaut had high hopes for this product though they were picturing the cybernaut Utopia where military and Law Enforcement Officers would be wearing these things at all times and call me crazy I think that would have been awesome put your hands up yeah that's right I got you cuz of my smart glasses I need backup gosh not now sick tired of these man are you okay yes I'm fine there's too many of them there's too many of them where's my backup your backup is been here for like an hour and I actually found a video of two guys explaining the cybernaut wearable computer in detail and if the computer is half as good as this audio quality and you'll have your stopping and your banking you'll have your St I'm the Washington Post reported that cybernaut didn't manage to sell more than 10,000 of the wearable computers over its 15-year tenure whatever the case things came to a head when criminal charges were filed for fraud against three men associated with the 1996 IPO and there was the fact that the company had lost 162 million since 1990 cybernaut filed for bankruptcy in 2005 so the thing was an absolute flop but hey who knows right maybe it's like a fine wine gets better with age maybe that's the case for all these products but there's only one way to find [Music] out all right I figured we would start with the handheld uh it didn't come with any batteries uh this was before the rechargeable battery craze but I did get this cool leather case pretty Sleek let's turn this thing on Tab Center of Target I guess this is like for uh for calibration dude it says it's January 2nd 1999 that is crazy okay wao we got a lot of stuff here dude what's graffiti write these letters oh you can actually like write whoa okay so if I go B oh this is crazy and if I go down here for numbers dude this is wild [Music] penis what else do we got here okay memo pad can I type or I'm trying to write hello but it's not working h e and it's turned off okay let's see if I can add something to my uh to my calendar so maybe at three I will eat so my main goal was to use this for typing things out and responding to emails and stuff but I got to say it is like next to impossible to write things on this handheld dude it's like learning a whole new language like it's learning how to write a whole new alphabet just to use this product I feel like it's so like counterproductive yeah I spent like 5 minutes trying to type into my calendar that I was going to eat at 300 p.m. there we go now I can plan out my day and after jumping over that three-letter hurdle I felt on top of the world I felt like I could conquer anything but then I made a devastating realization I should have realize this but I guess I can't really use this product to its full potential in its current state because it's like 25 years old and just the support doesn't really exist anymore for it yeah my dumbass fully expected this thing to have Wi-Fi capabilities but it does not you have to like type in your phone number for this thing to work and I did that and nothing happen so I'll never get to use this device to its full potential which is sad but I decided on a way that I can still use it going forward maybe I will carry this around just as like um a thing to you know jot my my notes down sometimes I I'll I'll walk around I'll think of an idea I'll type it in on my phone but maybe instead that's what I'll use this for even though I'm not very good at using it and also I think I might have just broken it oh no yeah while I was talking about how I can't use the handheld to its full potential because it's pretty useless the handheld computer became even more useless unless this is like a a secret message or something that we have to decode together it's a clue I'm going to steal the Declaration of Independence so I did the good oldfashioned reboot where you take the battery out and put it back in and that seemed to do the trick but that also made me realize a pretty huge design flaw I guess every time you take the batteries out it resets which doesn't really make sense to me on just like a a basic level on operating this thing cuz like batteries they die right so you have to switch them out every time what if you had like super important on here and you're supposed to keep super important on here like there's a literally a thing called security if you had a bunch of like important stuff on here and then the battery dies I guess you're just  like could you imagine that today if every time your phone died everything on it was deleted and totally Gone Forever all right well that about does it for that so far I'm going to keep using this I guess uh I'm going to try to anyway yeah so far I'm about 20 years late to this but I'm feeling like a 1 out of 10 right now for this thing dude I would not I would not recommend using one of these okay boldis call up my pilot okay a pilot is supposed to be knowledgeable skilled yeah this is this is more of a palm passenger I don't I don't know this is not good but who knows we maybe it'll grow on me so things were not off to a good start I was so excited to use this cool piece of technology but it was fortunately abandoned by Society handhelds were viewed as Obsolete and were tossed aside when blackberries were introduced to the market but hey what goes around comes around but I was determined to seamlessly integrate the rest of the Vintage Tech into my everyday life so I figured after the first piece of technology didn't really work at all I decided to try one that would definitely still work the portable TV I've been doing some more research and apparently it's like next to impossible to find an analog signal but I have hope maybe I'll find something cool I just want to watch one episode of SpongeBob on here okay but no it's it's pretty cool it it fits right in your hand you know it's a handheld TV so it makes sense you got different channels there I think the UHF stands for you're having fun I think that's what that means cuz you have fun when you watch TV and the VHF stands for V having fun yes V having fun I'm so I guess the only thing you have to do here is just get this bird to shut the up okay so it's searching for channels right now now I flipped from you're having fun to V having fun over and over waiting for a miracle to happen but I was hoping at the very least the TV would somehow pick up some audio can't really hear anything either I scanned for a signal for a few more minutes but nothing came up so nothing works anymore none of this works anymore that's great then I realized I forgot to use the actual part of the TV that receives signals oh yeah the antenna all right I'm going to go try it out in my yard so I was feeling pretty confident now that I had this big long antenna am I right fellas unfortunately the results were the same as they were when the antenna was collapsed and just goes to show you man it ain't the size of the boat it's the motion of the ocean still nothing thinking maybe I'm not high enough so I smoked a bunch of weed and then I tried it no I'm kidding I'm going to try going out of my window there to see if I get anything else but this is not looking too good for me I extended my arm outside of my window reaching for the heavens praying for a miracle my handheld TV was trying and trying searching for a signal that would not find find it another piece of technology forgotten by its creators it tried and tried but to no avail unfortunately we have failed didn't work all right so this isn't off to a very good start the handheld was a whole thing this TV doesn't work at all I feel like Napoleon Dynamite when you tried to use that time machine it's a piece of crap it doesn't work maybe I just forgot to put in the crystals and in my head I'm like okay maybe I could use this maybe I could like connect like a N64 to this or something you know but there's no there's not even any plugs to let me do that so there's literally no way this is a brick I can't do anything with this so I think I'm going to give this handheld TV a zero out of 10 don't get one of these looking back the research I did before purchasing the handheld TV was not thorough enough there are still analog stations in Canada but the closest one to me is like 3 hours away the whole reason I got the TV was to watch little videos but if the only way to do that is for me to Drive 3 hours there watch some videos and then drive 3 hours home there's no way I'm not going to do that and this is usually when YouTubers say just kidding I did it but no I'm not doing that okay can you imagine every time you wanted to watch Tik Tok or post a Tik Tok you had to drive 3 hours to a small town for it to work okay actually on second thought that would actually be a good thing I think we'd see a lot less crazy on there if it took a lot more work to post stuff dude I saw a video last week of a guy chewing on a mailbox hey guys let's chew on this mailbox that I found on the side of the road you're not driving 3 hours to Poe that okay you've got time to reflect but after these two hand sized devastating blows I figured it was time to try out the product that I knew for a fact would still work what time is it camera time check that out dude okay so from afar it looks like a normal watch right like in the distance I'd be like okay that's just a normal Casio watch but up close it's pretty it's pretty chunky look like bend hen yeah it tells the time and everything just like a regular watch I've got two little baby wrists apparently because I had to remove some links from this watch when I got it which I've never done before and it was pretty fun removing those links jeez listen to me removing links who am I Gondor but once I got it fitting on my wrist it actually didn't look too bad I do have a couple watches I I like watches I have some cool ones I got a cool Casio from the 8S I got the first original Apple watch but this one is definitely the most unique one in the in the collection for sure now a couple years ago I got a DM from Ice boox in Atlanta like that popular Jeweler and they asked me if I like needed any jewelry so you know maybe I'll bring this into them you know get it bust down get that bust down wrist camera yeah I mean I only ever use the camera on my phone to take pictures of my dog so I figured I would try to take some with this okay I feel bad because I woke kiwi up from a nap so he could pose in my pictures but he was sitting very still because he's a very good boy and it had nothing to do with the fact that he was tired and confused but after a minute or so I got got the shots I took two pictures of them and they honestly didn't turn out that bad the only tricky thing with the wrist camera is you have to keep your arm like incredibly still while you take the photo or else it's going to look super blurry and obviously it's a little cumbersome and awkward to use now because we're all so used to our iPhones but back in 2001 this would have been a great little Gadget to have to take pictures while you're on the go the only other difficult thing about this watch is the uh file management with iPhones you can sort your photos by time location date faces but with the wrist camera you could just scroll left or right and it also takes an insanely long time to delete photos to delete a photo you need to hold down the top left button while on the photo you want to delete then the bottom right to scroll down to the delete option and then press the camera button to select the delete option and then the bottom right button again to select the specified picture instead of deleting all of the pictures then you press the camera button again press the bottom right button to scroll down to yes press the camera button again and then you wait and then you wait a little bit longer it's almost done it'll be deleted in just a second you wait just one more second and it's deleted and I had to do this like 90 times because I realized the person who had this watch before me didn't delete any of the pictures on it I'm not blurring these photos because they're  up or anything I just don't want to put people in my video who don't want to be in my video but it was mostly just really cute selfies of like an older gentleman he looked really nice okay sorry my other microphone died so I got to use my iPhone like I'm a street interviewer gay son or thought daughter trick question the answer is both okay so after playing with this thing for a little bit uh it's actually pretty cool D she said I've been doing some research on how to get the pictures off of the watch onto a computer apparently I don't know if you can see but there's like a little scanner beside the lens that apparently can like transfer the images using like infrared or some there's a PC link kit that was supposed to come with this and the original box that I don't have and from what I'm reading on Reddit it's just like a whole ordeal to get them onto the computer but just like the other products if I got this when it came out and I had everything that I needed to do it I would have loved this thing this thing was awesome it's like really cool and it's just like fun you know like why aren't we doing this more we need a camera on the Apple watch okay I actually think I might wear this like in my everyday life it's just kind of cool you know and it's a little Conversation Piece yeah initial thoughts wrist Camera 7 out of 10 pretty cool and after that risk Cammer experience my week was back on track it made me feel a lot better also around this point of the week I did some more research on my handheld computer and I discovered if you tap the Little Dot in the corner an actual keyboard pops up that allows you to type a lot quicker thank God so whenever I had an idea for a joke I would just write it in my handheld okay and this is what I got I won an award for having the biggest shoes and that's no small feet I also wrote down horse girls are just Car Guys born in the wrong generation you know horses used to be cars and then I put down uh they say plants getting too much sun is bad for them my dad never had that problem it's an absent father joke and I wrote down I don't know if this is a joke really but I wrote down if you're allergic to peanuts and you're on death row uh your last meal should just be a jar of peanut butter you know go out on your own terms so it's good for something but a lot of the times I would think of a joke and forget to put it into my handheld if only there was a device that could remind me of stuff like that all right guys I think it's time to take a closer look at my little reminder got my cowboy table here so my little reminder it's it's small I guess that's why they call it my little reminder fits in the palm of your hand it's got this key ring thing on it so you can put it on your keychain if you want and I don't know if you can tell but listen to this it's pretty noisy even if you take the key ring out it should be called my little moraca you know usually having a noisy product is fine if it's like a stereo or something but for something that records audio it's pretty detrimental to it I'll record something really quick so you guys know what I mean milk juice butter eggs milk juice butter eggs every time you use it you can hear the clinking and clattering around every time I play an audio that I recorded on here it sounded like I was wearing a suit of armor while recording the audio go see my friends at the round table and then go to the pub to enjoy a tanker the quality is just bad like overall it sounds like but that's a a flashbang and there's only three buttons and only two of them have to do with the actual reminding it's either record or play and it's weird because you can only really remind yourself of like one thing cuz like as soon as you press record it immediately overwrites the previous recording so it's like really not that useful like I don't see the appeal really and this thing only records 20 seconds at a time so like you couldn't even do a full grocery list and I'll prove that to you I want to see how long it would actually record if I just read out a standard regular list of groceries that I pretty much get every week or 2 weeks one large cucumber two tomatoes to put under the Cucumber so they look like the Cucumbers balls 40 boxes of seis 5 G of weed from the cashier behind the grocery store when he's on his break one large container of KY Jelly a bushel of bananas a bottle of their finest Scotch every Men's Health Magazine they have available see and that now it's done and that's all you get it just stopped I still had two items on there whipped cream and sushi for me to eat off of my own naked body but I assume assume if you have like severe memory issues this this could help out but I still would like to try and use this for something so I'm going to go get a a coffee order for me uh and my wife I asked my wife what she wanted from the coffee shop and she said a small hot chocolate please so I recorded my order into my little reminder well I mean we're married so it's our little reminder medium coffee two cream two sugar and a small hot chocolate medium coffee two cream two sugar and a small hot chocolate I'll get a medium coffee with two two creams and Two Sugars and a small hot chocolate fuckum C sugar and a small hot chocolate I'll get a medium coffee two cream two sugar and a small hot chocolate I'll get a medium coffee with two cream two chocolate and small Hot Sugar car coming should have reminded myself on here to look both ways and cof it's just me and Myer I made it to the coffee shop and played the order one more time for good medium coffee two cream two sugar and a small hot chocolate now was time to see if it worked hi how's it [Music] going hot chocolate I could barely contain myself I wanted to jump for joy I wanted to scream from the rooftops I can remember anything with my coffee order in hand I felt like a million bucks I started dreaming about other things I could maybe remember one day what to get at the grocery store what to do at red lights what to do with toilet paper after I go number two stuff that I always forget I knew my wife was going to be proud of me too so I went back to my car and um uh where did I park my car oh no okay I found my car you can say what you want about my little reminder but it worked I remember those two drinks somehow so that means I can put a new recording on here my little reminder I hardly know her my little reminder I know her so in the commercial the guy also used the my little reminder for directions so I figured I would try that later tonight I'm going to a premiere of St bu's day which is a TV special that I am acting in it was like my my first big acting gig by the time this video comes out you can watch it on crave if you're in Canada but the premiere is tonight so I figured I will go home and record the directions on the Milo reminder so I know how to get there when I'm driving unfortunately the premiere was happening in Hamilton and I had to drive from downtown Toronto so it was going to be like an hour drive and I quickly realized that it was not humanly possible for me to read all the directions in 20 seconds ran out of time okay so this doesn't record long enough for me to say all the directions so I figured I would record all the directions put them in a audio editing software double the time and then record that with this so they can fit all of it so here we go and I know you're probably think thinking using your computer to speed up your audio is cheating that's modern technology and you know what that's a good point but on the other hand shut up okay I just sped up the directions by three times and it's just under 20 seconds so this should work I just have to record it on my my little [Music] reminder on the drive there I started to get a little lost so I played the recording on my little reminder and if you thought it was difficult to understand on the computer listen to what it sounded like on my little reminder incomprehensible by the grace of God I made it to the premiere without any help for my little reminder and I was going to say that like in the Modern Age my little reminder just it's pretty much useless but I also think it was useless back when it came out my little reminder is going to get a 2 out of 10 from me h which product is next my little reminder when you're done pooping grab the toilet paper and do one clean swipe from the bottom of the crack to the top I don't know what that stop stop stop that's not that's not real turn off turn it off turn off okay what the what the hell sorry it's an old product gets a little weird sometimes what's the next one we're going to talk about AT&T Video Phone 2500 time to make some phone calls I haven't opened this yet the AT&T video phone phone 2500 is supposed to be in here Moment of Truth oh God this thing's heavy dude holy I forgot that it came in the original box this so EXC wao almost cut my eyeball out of my head and that would suck cuz I need my eyes for this phone to work any other phone it'd be fine so whoever I bought this from I'd like to apologize for taking your fall Decor box away from you I'm sorry enhanced Communications AT&T video phone allows you to see and hear the person you are speaking to provided both parties have an AT&T video phone that's the thing I won't be able to actually call anybody because one I don't have any phone I don't have a phone line like a home phone thing in my house and also I don't know anybody who has one of these so if anyone has one of these please comment below we can call each other affordable video phone calls uh uses ordinary telephone lines so the cost for a video phone call is the same as a regular telephone call that's pretty cool a clear color picture okay compact portable design all right let's uh let's actually get it out of the box wa I love The Branding on it wrapped up again holy oh wow this is so cute thank you for the purchase this was my personal phone I used to video chat with my parents and family while I was away at Law School in 2001 funny to think but it was so Advanced for that time hope you enjoy that's the cutest thing I've ever read so I assume this is like the power B bang it's huge didn't it just say it was like a sleek and compact design compact portable design I'm going to plug this in and I'm going to have a power outage okay now it's time to unwrap the actual phone if anybody's wondering where all the bubble wrap is in the world it's in this box okay there's a bubble wrap shortage what happened n they sold another video phone here it is I guess this is like the video screen here wow okay I guess now all that's left is to just plug this in and uh see how it works it's making a noise it says video phone oh I can see myself okay so there's on the screen there's um a brightness option and you can like tweak how it looks on there it says low battery it's plugged into the wall yo I would have lost my mind if I had this in 2001 dude I love how it's really uh laggy so at one second you can be like like oh wow I love you I love talking to you on the phone I love it I love it you you dude I hate this I love it I love this I love it I love life I wish this caught on like quicker you call 911 while you're choking or something and you can't really talk right cuz you're choking so if I bought 911 on video you could just be [Music] like so I wanted to know how this video phone would actually function and luckily it came with the manual after a call has been established with someone with another video phone you can press video at any time to begin transmitting your video image okay for a 2-way video call the video button on both video phones must be pressed before I can see a picture the other person must also press video okay so here's the thing guys I have a really cool piece of technology here um and again like the other products in this video I can't  use it to its full potential I can just half use it and sort of Marvel in its weirdness so unfortunately this is yet another product that works but doesn't work like it was rare to find another person who had a video phone back when this came out but it's infinitely more rare today 25 years later but still this is like the common theme that I'm seeing with vintage Tech we're moving at such a  Fast Pace technologically and like really cool interesting unique products are cast aside and left to collect dust with no simple way to use them and I don't know man it's hard not to feel sad about that okay so far only like half of the product have actually like worked to their full potential I can't fully use this like I said but I am going to give this N9 out of 10 this thing is really cool wo I just got a crazy idea hold on I got my special watch on can I be the first person to take a picture of an AT&T video phone with a Casio wrist camera guys you are witnessing history in the making beautiful first guy to do it wow show up to school after Christmas break and be like yo I got a wrist camera and an AT&T video phone and and your friends are like no way I don't I don't believe you and then you go bam two in one you show him the video phone on the rist camera you talking about you talking about that would have been such a flex dude all right on to the next product don't mind me just going to take my elevator [Applause] there despite a lot of these products not working fully I was having a great time with my vintage technology but there was something missing music and that video phone was really cool but I think it's time to try out a phone of the bone variety so my buddy Jacob came over so we could try out the bone phone together you have a bone phone with your brother we are here to try out the bone phone this is what I feel like to be trying the bone phone I probably shouldn't be putting my mouth so close to it cuz it's like from the 70s so like I said this came out in 1979 um if you want to get a closeup there we got the AM FM switch there and you can like I guess dial it to which station you want volume control onof button and then tone low and high I don't know what that means should have said bone it's like when you're um when you talk back to your mom she's like glower your tone it's like that I guess yeah is there an attitude button on yeah this music is too angry so this actually takes doublea batteries which I'm a big fan of um and to get to the batteries you kind of have to peel down the for skin on on the bone phone I wish the bone was a cut on this phone yeah uncircumcised bone phone and this does have a few stains okay so moment of truth it's my favorite song okay so it works so how about we find also just sounded like like a man screaming let me out it's a man in the bone I can't play any more of the song because it'll get a copyright claim but it worked also it seemed pretty fitting for a floppy snake looking thing to play a Drakes on you guys see that video oh my God but it was time to see if the bone phone delivers on its promise the main thing that the bone phone was uh advertising was how it vibrates your bones it sort of vibrates you it gives you a gives you a sensation of standing in front of a stereo you say vibrates you again vibrates you it VI what does it do it vibrates you okay let's see what it feels like again can't play the song for copyright reasons but initially I didn't feel any vibration but something happened when I move my shoulders a bit okay now oh wow it must have awoken the bone phone's dormant power because this is when I really started feeling the vibration through my bone at that time I felt it it did kind of feel like it was I was in front of a stereo last one uh fill in the blank here if x player has a strong season uh that will greatly augment the cups chances yeah I'm going to go with Michael Bush here I got a Michael Bush right here for you you want to try this I kind of do okay wo it does like it has some weight to it this looks cool oh it's pretty loud like you can I can't really feel it like exactly in my bones ET phone bone we started playing around with a tone setting and it was tough to figure out what it actually did but we think it's to control like the base of the audio we could be wrong I honestly I have no idea why that's there but after trying this thing out I asked Jacob to give his rating I would give this uh the tone the attitude I'd say like maybe i' give it that like nine just because of the Ingenuity I've never seen anything like this it's completely handsfree well unless you need to turn it on or do anything outside of that as soon as you're turned on you're moving and grooving from my bone aspect I'm going to give it I'm going to give it a three three bones I love what they were trying to do again the tone the attitude cuz it's like a little scarf yeah like think you're going to be like well why don't you shove it up your dick hole why don't you widly suck my balls all right folks this whole week has been leading up to this the craziest piece of vintage technology I have ever laid my hands on cybernaut ma4 wearable computer they came in this crazy ass ow ow I stepped on that it came in this deal or no deal type uh briefcase imagine pull up to like the airport airport security with only this can I check this is this a carry on it'll fit yeah pretty cool that it came with the original case um unfortunately though there's two versions of it with cyber View and with cyber panel and with the Cyber panel it's just like uh this screen here the Cyber view is actually the one with the headset and the thing and I messaged the seller and he didn't have it so it never came with it which sucks cuz I was really excited to have it there but I am convinced to make this work truth bead I didn't know what TBH meant I thought it meant truth bead truth bead me and Jacob we were really trying to get this thing working cuz it comes with um we got a battery pack here and we got another charging thing over there but this is the actual computer this is the the the Cloris of the computer can you remember old laptops had that little little nub that little red thing so this is like that this is like the mouse left click right click and is the actual computer keyboard that goes on your arm this is the screen and this screen has a thing for your arm to go through as well I might just have to be a screen keyboard I don't know where the computer's going to go I don't know how I'm going to control it when I'm on the go I think we got to tape it to you just duct tape it to me that's the only thing that really makes sense [Music] unless I could just put it through and then it could just sort of like hang on to my remember when we were in high school and like that like buckles were huge yeah they were big culturally and physically they were big and then this also has to go somewhere too that it's only really being used the keyboard cuz there's nothing for the keyboard to but Connect into here what's great about this little like power bar is just like the potential of what you can plug in that's like there's a USB which is actually pretty crazy right like isn't that insane I could put like a USB stick in there could put in a iPhone charger yeah well not these days not  these days no lightning Port Steve Jobs that one too do your job Steve sorry he's dead right yeah so was the guy who made this he's dead financially yes but apparently this is um this is like a a case for the the battery pack that's supposed to sort of clip in I guess to your belt also but we have one issue that we have to figure out because we tried this battery pack and it says it's 75% charged but it's not working when we plugged it in but but it's working when it's plugged into that battery plugged into the wall so maybe I'm guessing like maybe these batteries just like maybe aren't as good anymore cuz they're like so old as for right now we have to figure out a way for me to actually do this in in the world cuz the whole thing is you're supposed to be wearing it right you can't just be sitting at a  thing with it on cuz then you can just have a computer so we're going to plug this in and just get it up and running just to do a quick little uh look at what it looks like I gathered all the components together and began setting up on the ground beside the outlet and it's just so crazy how many different pieces there are to make this thing work so many wires man what is this that show The Wire um okay so this is the power see on the other side all right and now we turn it on waa so this should be turning on at any moment oh wow cyber nut cyber cyber nut that's hilarious oh it came with a little stylus W make sort of Doodles or yeah or maybe write a write a Nolla yeah oh all right whoa genius inside TMI oh my God it's like a like a real desktop yeah holy Internet Explorer let's go let's see what happens wow no way cool okay so it's it's just pretty much like a computer oh dude they got paint yeah okay I don't think I can show the rest because I drew a pretty detailed wiener but that's just guys being DED man you give any guy something to draw with and something to draw on they're going to draw at least one dick okay that's just the way it goes dude this is awesome that is the Cyber nut that is I just threw the Cyber nut save changes Yep this is the perfect time to use the keyboard sorry let me take my wrist camera off it as I was strapping on the keyboard Jacob said reminded him of a Yu-Gi-Oh dual disc and I told him that was a comparison that I made as well but he also had another genius comparison the web shooters ooh yeah dude web web this is the original web shooter that's crazy this is the original hul the world dude the worldwide web shooter a little loose I guess I have a little he got little baby arms a little baby this reminds me when I fractured my wrist in high school and I had to wear a something a keyboard it took a little bit of getting used to but I figured out how to use the arm keyboard and honestly felt cool as hell and I was actually able to save my creation and this was a hell of a lot faster than typing on the handheld earlier in the week I did it I don't know what it says about me that also the first thing I typed on my Palm Pilot was also penis really yeah you do have a penis that's true yeah so I'm curious about this okay here we go now it's working okay you can like oh the mouse yeah it was a little awkward to maneuver the mouse around but again for something that came out in1 1999 this is really impressive and the controls were oddly simple to like wrap your head around and just like the RIS camera this device also had some files left on it from the previous owner dude this is sick are you kidding me Xbox 640 let's see what they [Music] [Laughter] mean what the the Xbox logo this is the cool coolest thing of all time dude um that epic gamer model this is so funny why is it just a picture of theb it's just a picture of the Xbox logo in paint like did someone make this on paint no yeah I don't think someone made that on paint and you know I'm at Jacob in 2013 during our first year of college and you know when you make a friend and you're like ah what the hell we could have been friends for so long we missed out on like freaking 20 years of awesome times you know that's how I feel me and Jacob we could have had a a long friendship before but using this little computer for the first time with him it Lally felt like we were both 10 years old at like a sleepover and we're both like using the family computer when everybody else is sleeping like we had such a blast using this thing but after giggling about the Xbox logo for a long time we asked the most important question of all time you got any games on there so we searched the system for the classic computer game mind sweeper mind sweeper I hardly know her nothing no games no games we were sad about the lack of games but nevertheless using this device felt Monumental most people will go their whole lives without using one of these things so we had to make a note of this occasion so I pulled up the memo pad to write this down in the history books it is 2024 and me and my friend Jacob are using the cybernaut computer we then discovered some other files that were left on the computer got Windows Media Player and there's songs on [Music] here okay B each word into the microphone when the word is highlighted by the blue box remain silent between words like this hello oh he's got Peter [Music] Gabriel oh there shocking the monkey all right dude if I only had this on my bone phone you think the bone phone's got Bluetooth well the tooth is a bone also how's my how's my posture looking right now we played around a little more on the wearable computer talking about all the possibilities could you imagine using this as a child yep cuz it says you can insert like discs right yeah there's a disc attachment you can do there is a floppy disc drive also so you could play like Roller Coaster Tycoon yeah you get really good games on there yeah I should try to get a game a floppy drive game the tonum Pumba game you get in a Serial box yeah yeah one of those ones Franklin Goes to Jail or whatever and I don't know if it's because all the other products didn't really work the way they were supposed to but we were so hyped on this thing this is awesome it's so crazy to think back to a time where this was cutting edge like before you needed whole  briefcase but now like all that and more is just in your hand it's it's crazy man right off the bat this is sick just using it but the issue like I said we have before is that we can't really use it when it's not plugged into a wall like all the other products the cybernaut computer has just worned down over time the batteries didn't really hold a charge very well and it said that on the eBay listing so we needed a solution if we were going to take this thing on the go we got to talking and we came up with a pretty genius idea so this was the plan it's one thing to use the wearable computer inside right I wanted to go out into the world wearing the wearable computer and to combat the issue of the shitty battery we thought of the idea to go get a portable generator to bring with us to act as the permanent battery supply if we were to somehow get like a generator take the house with take the wall with you yeah because what the cybernaut wearable computer needs is one more thing for it to plug into so let's go see if this plan works we went to a park just outside of Toronto and I don't know what was going on with the weather this week because a few days ago when I was trying out my handheld TV it was sunny and warm outside felt like summer but just a few days later it was snowing like crazy and it was freezing outside but it actually might have been a blessing in disguise because there wasn't anybody at the park when we went to try out the computer which is a good thing because I looked like [Music] this yeah usually if there's a guy in a park in a trench coat and sunglasses with a briefcase and a camera on a tripod next to a playground bad things are happening if we did this on a nice day and the park was filled with people cops would have been called they would have put me in jail they would have given me my one phone call and I would have been like what no AT&T video phone so I'll give you a quick breakdown of all the components here down by on my feet I had the portable generator powering the computer up here in my pocket was where I kept the computer battery to keep the snow away from it this gray bar dangling in front was the port connector where I pluged the keyboard into above that was the actual computer strapped onto my belt on my right arm was the Monitor and on the left arm held the keyboard and right above that I had my handy dandy bone phone this was the man of the future in 1999 I'm still with the future and with everything plugged in it was time for the moment of Truth would this work with our little portable generator did too much snow get into the computer system can I finally achieve the dream of portable Computing that they were trying to achieve 25 years ago we turned on the generator I booted up the computer and I Waited For What seemed like forever and then that sweet cybernaut logo popped up on the screen I'm in the blizzard raged on and while I stood there in the cold I realized something this wasn't just me trying out an old tech product this was a battle between man and nature what are snowflakes if not pixels falling from the sky why is it you can't spell Windows without wind this is where man and machine meet and I am the one who invited both of them to the park so I decided that I would complete two tasks while wearing my wearable computer number one paint a landscape of the park on paint and two write a high coup on the memo pad I open up paint and began creating my masterpiece I figured I needed to do this quickly because my hands were freezing due to the fact that it was minus 10 outside on that day it was starting to come together but a small issue arose that we didn't really think about my arm's getting pretty tired yeah holding it up here I kind of wish I had the thing right here oh yeah unfortunately not a complete set e but nevertheless I persisted do you think Michelangelo quit painting the cinee chapel when his arm got tired of course not and this is the exact same after a few minutes my masterpiece was complete not bad right this might be the best painting you've ever seen that was made on a cybernaut ma4 wearable computer I saved the painting but the screen was really starting to weigh my arm down savez thing so the thing is small but it is heavy am I right fellas this is weighing me down too this looks like a dick with my painting done it was now time for my poem I decided to go with the ha coup because those they're relatively easy and quick to write and they also don't always have to rhyme so I pondered counted syllables pondered some more counted more syllables and a few minutes later I had a completed ha coup future com and gone a wearable computer my arm is so tired wow hey guys I'm editing when I was making my painting I made like a stupid joke to the camera maybe I'll put this on merch sell it but then it got me thinking that could could be cool so I'm going to sell a limited amount of signed prints I'm going to sign all of them going to put them on sale okay so they're on my website it'll probably be pre-order cuz I still have to print all them and sign them but I think it'll be cool so yeah check them out so I remember the USB plug from the initial test of the computer so I thought it would be fun to fill a USB stick with modern memes pictures and videos that probably never got the chance to Grace the screen of a cybernaut ma4 wearable computer I have the ninja tweet the video of KD offering Jimmy a nail the E meme Drew's road workor ahead Vine and many more but when I loaded up the USB stick it said it was an unknown device I tried and tried to get it working but the computer just wouldn't accept it but you know what I think that's okay I think maybe the cybernaut was trying to tell me something maybe it didn't want to see the memes we've been enjoying for the past 20 years this cybernaut ma4 wearable computer has been laying around unused for years forgotten by the modern world I mean most likely the USB stick that I used was probably just using technology that was a little too advanced for a computer made in 1999 but I'd like to think that the computer rejecting the modern media was the cybernaut saying you know what I'm okay I'm too old for all that stuff anyway I'm just happy I was able to be a wearable computer for just one more [Music] day [Music] we had fun didn't we thank you so much for watching this video if you're still here I think this is the longest video I've ever made and I had a blast making it because this is something I'm very interested and passionate about um it's always fun to make videos where I'm not I angry at stuff if you have any old technology don't throw it away keep it in the best condition you can for as long as you can because I truly think preservation of this stuff is incredibly important I had a blast trying out all these products and uh if there's one thing I learned from this video is that human beings are like really cool and creative and ambitious and stupid and weird and ridiculous in the best ways possible I don't know looking at these past products there was so much hope and Ingenuity behind them they knew they were not there yet but they still try and I honestly think that is the best quality we all share these nuts these nuts if you enjoyed this video please let me know by pressing the like button and leaving a comment okay and maybe I'll do a part two and if you've had any weird Tech you've heard of or if you have any laying around somewhere please reach out to me okay send me a DM and maybe it'll make it into the second video and press the Subscribe button because as soon as you press the Subscribe button you become a valued citizen of Curtis toown if you didn't know Curtis toown is the best place to live in the world and I'm the mayor of Curtis toown soce to [Music] it's it looks so crazy"

I mean let's be honest very few things beat that next-gen console feeling and yeah while Sony has more exclusive games that I love like Horizon and Ratchet and Clank the series X still had my attention from the very beginning being technically the more powerful console of the two plus Xbox has Halo sleepovers at my friend's houses playing old school Halo was a massive part of my childhood and so when I saw this teaser of a true next gen Halo that was coming to this console with the promise of full Split Screen Co-op which is a massive deal to me because my favorite thing to do is to play video games with someone sitting in the same room as me I'm pretty sure I wet myself I mean I ordered the best console to play the game on the series X and I patiently waited [Music] I mean for starters the moment Xbox revealed the first real gameplay of this next-gen Halo the internet let out a collective groan realizing that it didn't really look very next generation at all so the game got delayed by a whole year and then that split screen cult feature that I was so excited about canceled so Halo was kind of a dud for me and then almost nothing came out after that there were some Xbox exclusives but very very thin on the ground and in any game that released on both Xbox and PS5 I got for PS5 because it actually in my experience seems to run a lot better which is kind of ironic considering the whole Xbox most powerful console in the world thing the key redeeming factor for Xbox now is definitely Game Pass which is pay monthly play as many games as you want but since I'm someone who tends to pick one game and play that for like three quarters of a year that model doesn't really work for me so this series X that I was once so so excited about now sits in my basement as a glorified media player which is quite sad but even more so than console gaming I've always been a handheld guy whether it's being able to play on the plane or under the covers at night or let's be honest on the toilet there's always for me been something really freeing about owning a handheld game it's this feeling that once you own the game you can play it whatever the situation you end up in and that feeling has always stopped with me like if you compare my Play Time on the PSP or the DS or the Nintendo switch to any Home console it's literally 10 times but then equally as somebody who used to build his own computers and has had a real taste of PC gaming I also have a very high appreciation for graphics so as soon as this concept of handheld consoles that can play full quality PC titles appeared with products like the steam deck and the Asus Rog Ally I was getting ready to sell everything I own live in a box and spend the rest of my days playing out Monster Hunter world but portably I pre-ordered a steam deck and I bought myself an Asus Rog Ally as well as being sent another one for the purposes of review but that Vision that I had in my mind it was just too good to be true when everything works yes these products do feel like magic it genuinely feels like everything I ever dreamed of in a console but the day-to-day reality of it is just you are constantly reminded that Windows as an operating system is not made for gaming handhelds like this but this will never have close to the level of polish that something like the Nintendo switch does that pretty much every single PC game is designed for one person to play on their own compared to the very social switch that I'd gotten used to where you just zip off one of your joy-cons and hand it to your friend but the single biggest thing is the battery if you actually want to use this thing in the way that it's intended the Rog Ally will literally get to you one to two hours of gameplay before needing a charge which given that my Journeys are either three hours into London or 10 hours into the United States it just doesn't give me that same feeling of Freedom that makes handhelds so special to me right you ready to see how I wasted six thousand dollars last year this bad boy this Houdini and let me just tell you on the picture that I had in my mind a 3D printer so Advanced that it can print food like real edible foods would not just laser-like Precision but also using any 3D model that you can find on the internet I can't stress to you how much I just really really wanted this to to work I had this whole idea that I was going to challenge a famous chef to a cooker right okay and then use this machine to literally 3D print the perfect steak and blow them off their feet I made mixture at the mixture I tried Savory with an avocado base like it recommended I tried sweet with cookie dough to the exact recipe that the product told me to and I just could not get it to work I had mixtures that dribbled I had explosions where literally food particles reached the wall behind you and I was just sat there scrubbing slash licking it because it still tasted good yeah boy so why didn't it well I came to the sad realization that food is not 3D printing filament it's not sticky in the same way so more often than not it does doesn't stay in the exact spot it's been printed in most food doesn't have the structural strength to be able to support a multi-layered 3D model which is why I ended up resorting to 2D shapes but couldn't even do that properly because fundamentally food is uneven you can calibrate a 3D printer all you want but you can't factor in that little chunk of tomato still left in your otherwise perfectly smooth guacamole yes this links to how the explosion happened we're getting to the big boys now I regret buying the 2019 Apple Mac Pro this was around the time where the channel was really picking up for the very first time my editing workload was getting a little too heavy for my Intel Core i7 Macbook so I thought if I just make one big investment now I can save myself hours every single video from now on just waiting for things to happen so I sucked it up I pulled together 25 000 and bought one of the highest configurations of the Mac Pro you could get a server grade Intel Xeon W processor eight terabytes of solid state storage and 192 gigabytes of RAM and I remember at the time that I got it I felt like okay this is faster than my MacBook for sure about 25 faster which is something but not the 500 faster that the price would indicate I stuck with it for a couple of years because it was better than the Alternatives but I started to fall out of love I was still used to being a laptop guy just flitting between rooms that me stuck up in the attic of this house on this it just started to feel quite isolating and then something else up Apple launched their own Apple silicon MacBooks and I kid you not the minute I opened up Final Cut Pro on this new Macbook with an M1 maths chip I knew that my use for this machine was over the MacBook had the level of fluidity that I'd never seen before in a video editing program it wasn't just that it was powering through the workload but it felt like it was doing it so easily that it wasn't even trying and this was both really impressive considering that this is a laptop and it was priced at four thousand dollars instead of what's meant to be a 25 000 supercomputer but also really sad because it immediately invalidated the biggest purchase I'd ever made this wasn't worth 25 000 anymore it was worth like three and over the last couple of years exclusively using this laptop it feels like the Intel Mac Pro has just gotten slower and slower to the point where now I still use it but I use it almost exclusively to display the backgrounds for our videos which to do on a 300 machine but it gets more expensive much much more expensive you might have seen that video where I bought my mom her dream car the Mercedes eqs yeah I mean I still don't think she's over it she tells me every day how much she appreciates it and nothing changes the fact that this is still a spaceship of a car but we severely underestimated the hassle of electric cars at least here in the UK like for example the range when we bought the car we were quoted a range of around 450 miles I mean the car model is called the eqs 450 plus which would actually imply more than 450. and while I'm not upset that we didn't hit those numbers you know I was expecting 350 400 maybe the reality 250. once you factor in the heating and the occasional bit of traffic which means that this car is not even enough to do the one regular trip that we do to and from London without needing a charge and then the charging is what makes this entire situation so much more so for our main charger that we keep at home Mercedes recommended someone to install it for us they installed the wrong one we were told that we had the first year of charging for free which is great but then it turns out that the selected charging points that that was applicable for are so far away from us that it would never be worth actually driving past them okay so we'll pay for charging when we're on the go if you can actually find a charging spot because there are fast charges here in the UK ones that can fully charge this eqs from zero to 100 in like 30 minutes but every single electric car user on the road wants them and so assuming that you don't get one of those because the vast majority of the time you don't you could well end up with a charger that could take three full hours of you just sitting there reading a magazine to get back 30 of your battery life now one thing that I have installed on my aging Mac Pro to make me feel slightly better about it is the Opera browser and there's three reasons why I really like it the first is tab Islands so a few weeks ago Scouting Around for a place for me and my friends to stay while we went on holidays so I opened up Airbnb found a few options that I wanted to consider and then immediately as I decided that I wanted to do a bit of work I tap this one button and every Airbnb tab collapses into this one tiny little thing so I have a completely decluttered workspace two the fact that AI is literally at your fingertips let's say you're researching and you want to ask a really specific question about something you don't even need to touch your mouse you tap the command and slash key and paste or you type in your question and you hit enter it's a really fluid way to interact with AI and what I really like about it is that it's there when you want it and it just disappears when you don't and then one is all the nice to haves the fact that your social medias are baked into the sidebar the fact that you've got a VPN and an ad blocker just baked inside of it not to mention the silky smooth animations made possible by a separate software layer that handles them so even when your internet lags fluidity of the browser doesn't so download the upgraded version of the Opera browser it's the best browser for tech fans

12,000 reviews all right lick day I lick the sound of you Que headphones ah I remember you the Dyson Zone headphone and face mask it's just such a strange product that I can only assume exists for the sole purpose of getting people to talk about Dyson okay let's try useless computer tech I wonder if these companies know that they're paying for ads to come up when people type in useless tech oh no Center cam I just realized what this is so someone's built a webcam to sit in the middle of your your screen so that you can have direct eye contact with whoever you're calling this just feels like the most ridiculous form of over engineering to fix a problem that no one really has oh we can either get the camera or we can get the deluxe package which includes a lens privacy cover then you can cover up your very poor purchase decisions but all that said I am actually curious now stupid gadgets okay Yep this is what we came for someone's built a smart egg minder that lets you know when you're low on eggs or you know you could just check the eggs before you go shopping like you will have to do for every single one of your other products anyway oh there really are some not very clever products on the internet what's this the happy fork the happy fork is a bluetooth enabled smart fork that vibrates when it senses you're eating too fast This falls spoton in the category of I'm pretty sure it's dumb but it might just work the Air Neo selfie pocket drone okay so just so I understand this is a drone designed to take your selfies there's just no way that this situation exists in real

immerse yourself into that in-game experience and away from your spouse would I be lying if I said there wasn't 10% of me that really wanted one of these it's definitely more than 10 although speaking

cleaner it says no more bending over with a dust pan but then what about a normal vacuum cleaner it's got a weird alien drop pod sci-fi kind of vibe to it though which I kind of dig oh we also need some useless clothing someone's designed a jacket with an air conditioning unit inside I'm just racking my brain trying to imagine the situation of oh I'm really hot right now let me put on my jacket a leather designer belt that's also a power bank you'll always have it with you belt buckles are kind of thick anyway I'm somewhat interested cuff links that are also working clogs well okay as long as you remember to bring your microscope every time you go out the zip tie bracelet oops now it's on forever this thing looks interesting well on one hand it actually looks a lot like those $20

quickly for ourselves whether it's bogus or not the ice designer tray looks like it engraves patterns into your ice cubes it's definitely one of those never occurred to me to want products but now that I see those results I am curious the Thirsty Goose the stylish solution for men's urinary needs oh this is like one of those bedside toilet things get the job done and go back to sleep do you like winning stay in the zone with the Thirsty Goose urinal it's actually a Premium electroplated Gold beak that's yeah everything's just arrived and this is probably going to be the most interesting video in this ibought series ever for me cuz I have genuinely no idea if these products are going to be atrocious or amazing so let's find out from the cheapest all the way to the most expensive starting at $10 for those who decided they wanted to pay3 times as much money to buy wireless earphones instead of wired earphones and then decided they wanted to wire up those wireless earphones to make them wired earphones the airpods wire so each one of these ends has a rather squishy circular hole place the airpod inside the hole and oh that's not going anywhere and so okay let's say I've got my earphones in and I'm shaking my head and I H I feel like the problem is at the point where one of your earphones is already flying out your ear it's going to be traveling with so much momentum that it can most likely just pull the other one with it now I think of it are you more likely to lose both of your earphones using this here's the thing though if these actually did properly secure into your ears then I don't think the idea of wiring up your wireless earphones is actually such a crazy idea because let's say you're an iPhone user it's not unreasonable that you might want Apple earphones because they pair really well but then let's say you want the best Apple earphones those aren't wired Apple only makes good wireless earphones so you have to get the airpods and then if you're doing a lot of running with them you have to get some sort of way of securing them it's just that this doesn't even really properly do that job so 2 out of 10 on the actually useful scale now for a product that on a very personal level I'm excited for the spoon that makes your food taste better yesh well let's hope the product is better designed than the packaging I it does all sound a little bit science fiction this thing supposedly enhances the flavor of the food improves your aftertastes by exciting your tongue with mild electr stimulation okay yogurt me that could have gone worse so your finger needs to be covering the contact strip at the back your food needs to cover the emitter on the front and then as soon as you've done that apparently when my lips touch this food it's going to complete some sort of circuit and activate the technology the light does come on interesting I was completely convinced this was going to be bogus but why did that actually taste nice this is my yogurt connoisseur era I think it might actually just be really nice yogurt I signed up to review Tech not yogurt okay maybe we do it VI ratings it's a normal spoon8 out of 10 spoon [Music] Tech 8 out of 10 so what I'm imagining is happening here is as soon as my lips touch that spoon it is completing some sort of circuit that lights up an LED on the inside and that's all it does oh yeah look you don't need food or your mouth to activate the technology but we should try this with more Foods throughout the video and then when we're done we could actually just take it apart and see for ourselves and while we're in the kitchen there's no point lying about it I'm a bit of a sucker for a fruity pink cocktail daddy chill anytime I make something a dinner a drink a YouTube video I always like to make sure that it's presented well and so that part of my brain really gravitates towards this idea of this Ice Cube designer tray but then the rational part of my brain is thinking yes Aon $40 and 10 minutes of time to carve a pattern into an already melting Ice Cube to make one drink look 5% nicer for 60 seconds not your best purchase so let's find out okay so Ice Cube goes onto here and then oh my God wait that was like that was like three seconds okay wait so now I use this one I did not expect the pace of this thing and not going to lie it's really cool how it works too it's no electronics it's just aluminium that quickly conducts heat from the air and transfers it to the Ice Cube so that the bits that touch the ice melt the ice I'm just so impressed at how something so manual is still able to work so efficiently and then to think you could have like 12 ice cubes going all at the same time so this is actually what barbecues look like in the UK I was definitely expecting this to be one of those expectation versus reality products but question is though how long does the pattern last when you put it into a drink so it's been about 2 minutes and I'd say it's mostly gone at this point but this was a room temperature drink if you put it into an already refrigerator drink probably get five out of it but you know what not pointless at all that's a 9 out of 10 so you remember the spoon Tech it was an interesting idea but I feel like for more of us the problem is not that food needs to taste better it's that it already tastes a little too good and that is what the happy fork is designed for and while on one hand it does seem abolutely ridiculous to let a fork decide when you're full or not as opposed to just you know knowing yourself there's one thing that makes me think it has a chance it's that while of course we do know very well ourselves when we've had enough it's pretty widely documented that there is a 20 minute delay between us actually having eaten enough and our body communicating to our brain that we've eaten enough so that's 20 minutes within which you might well be eating way more than your body needs so happy fork which is now aggressively vibrating to tell me that it's on is designed to help you slow down by measuring all sorts of things like how often the fork touches your mouth how long it spends in your mouth it's all very intimate stuff but the idea is that it will figure out if you're eating too fast and it will alert you okay so first sign of poor product design there's a blinking LED light to tell you that the fork is active you can barely see it so I think I'm just going to try and specifically eat quickly now to see if it triggers okay it buzzed four bites in so I guess that a very basic level it does what it says it's doing that was a lot of chickpeas that's a bit spicy so what if I eat at my normal speed I'm a little bit scared of being judged [Music] here so I can buite feel like I need to evaluate my entire life so what I'm curious about is what metrics is this using to decide what counts as a mouthful of food and can you trick it so what if I just go [Music] empty okay second bite it buzzes what if I don't even touch my mouth okay that does nothing so it seems like this actually works in a very similar way to the spoon Tech this entire handle is basically one metal contact point and then this becomes the other and to complete the circuit it has to go inside your mouth I guess this is the technological way of achieving the same thing yum the spice is really building kind of wish I was back doing the yogurt now so product does actually work and the way the product works is actually pretty foolproof like as long as you're not trying to trick it I'd say it does deliver on its premise pretty well only thing is it was meant to be a mobile app which let you upload and track the data from it but since I guess this didn't sell the billions that the found as we hoping the app no longer exists so you lose half of the functionality still a seven $120 $120 is what we just spent on this phone case let's be honest not really even a phone case my hypothesis is that it's going to be worse but maybe just maybe they figured out something here that the others haven't so I will give them this it might look like your unhinged child has just melted some toy plastic jewelry over the back of your phone but in person this actually feels very high quality this is Aerospace grade aluminium on the outside for high structural strength and then on the inside is a rubbery elastomer that's designed to spread the impact away from the point of contact but does it work so let's find out starting now oh good technically though the phone is absolutely fine you can see where the case has taken a bit of a hit but the phone is exactly as it was do you know what this is really growing in my rankings because it really does feel like you're just using your phone naked in terms of the weight the thickness and also the fact that you are for the most part directly touching your real phone's body so that was drop one which shows that the case can protect your phone if you have a bit of a fumble and it falls out of pocket height drop two though is where we actively try and damage it okay 3 2 1 oh it's looking pretty good okay that is yet again a completely unmarked iPhone now for test three the uneven surface this is where I imagine it is going to break but if it survives then I would go as far as to say good product given how many benefits there are to the way it feels and also things like reduced 5G interference and better heat dissipation these cobbled floors scare me but I think we're just going to have to yink it in three 2 one let's find out okay Moment of Truth and we are absolutely fine o decent chunk of damage in that top corner I got to say though I was very resistant about this product but every time I've interacted with it it's improved slightly in my rankings the center screen webcam though has really got its work cut out for me if it wants to impress me cuz well I mean it's not even necessarily because the idea is dumb but more because of the existence of AI I'll explain I'd say the camera is decently specked it's got a 1080p resolution and an F 2.1 aperture which should let in a reasonable amount of light but the thing I'm most curious about is is the quality going to be significantly better than a normal webcam because it's taking up about eight times the depth okay so you clamp the peg on top of your laptop oh my God this looks ridiculous usba need an adapter USB port in there because I also got the deluxe package you get a light which now can't go in the center of your screen oh again with the cables though I imagine it's been designed to accommodate big desktop PCS but it just means that for a laptop user this is not a good look hello can you hear me yeah wow yes I can okay one second so I've got a little lighting fixture over here that comes with it how do I look it's better than not having it so what's the quality like on your end well the quality is not good it's purple uh it's dark it's a uh just cut out as well wait this is so embarrassing oh there there you go okay so so the question is yeah so am I making direct eye contact with you if I kind of oh actually no so I sped the way the way I meant to do it is Bend this camera so it's over your face and now now it's sideways but if uh if I was sideways this would that's yeah sure you can say that's I yeah so actually yeah the only way to get eye contact with this call is to cover the person you're calling so you're probably not seeing part of my face but at least it looks to me like you're looking at me yeah so I'm trying I'm trying to think who is this product for it's like it's for someone who absolutely obsesses over making eye contact with someone else who's already not making eye contact with you have you seen U Microsoft's fake eye contact yes yeah and nvidia's done it too and that's kind of what's on my mind like when something like that that exists and then you look at the hardware equivalent way of achieving it it doesn't really make any sense $150 is where we're at now and that my friends is a hell of a lot of money to spend on a Bluetooth speaker also it's absolutely miniature it's not a convincing start the thing feels empty but I'm curious cuz you might know that I've gotten into the Habit recently of watching a little bit of TV on my laptop as I'm falling asleep I don't know how it happened but as soon as my body hears an American sitcom it just starts shutting down so at this point I'm just not questioning it point is I am the target market for this I'm just I'm not convinced how this is going to be any better than listening on laptop speakers so it works using bone conduction which means that unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker which evenly spreads out the vibration in like 180° this concentrates those vibrations within your skull and so that would explain how they've apparently made it so that only you can hear what's coming out of this and not the person sleeping next to you so this is approximately what my sleep setup looks like got a laptop on the side where I'm watching my show my pillow where I put my head and the duska is going to go beneath that right let's take this thing for a spin I don't actually fall asleep to my own videos this is for copyright purposes oh interesting so when you play the speaker and you're just holding it out like this it sounds bad it sounds extremely tiny but putting it under here shows that it has been thoroughly optimized for this under pillow environment it sounds completely different so does it matter where I am in the pillow the sound does fade As you move away from it but not significantly like I can still hear the video while all the way on the other end of the pillow okay but what happens when you turn and lie on your back okay I'd say you lose about 20% of the volume but still very audible I wouldn't say the sound is crystal clear this isn't a $150 audio experience but it's full it feels like you're enveloped within it because you kind of are there is also an app which is it's got power level and one advantage of this over earphones is that it should last s nights per charge a timer which is a little pointless since most streaming services have timers built into them and then different sound profiles which do genuinely improve the clarity but here's the thing none of that matters if the person next to you can hear that sound the only purpose of this product is if it actually can isolate that audio to you and you only otherwise you might as well just listen on your laptop speakers Joseph can I borry you I just need a bed partner if I'm lying down like this and I'm listening to my bedtime shows how much can you hear and how disturbing is it to your sleep that's quite disturbing okay yeah don't look that so that would that would stop you from sleeping yes it would stop me from well among other reasons okay eliminate the fact that it's one of our videos it's just out loud enough that I want to try and listen to it m so it's kind of too present to be ignored it's 80% towards achieving its goal but until it gets to that 100% where you can't hear it yeah it's pointless yeah it's actually worse than sence cool that's handy right thank you so for the time being this is about a 4 out of 10 have you ever wanted to add so much complexity to the simple Act of taking a selfie that it becomes actually easier just to ask someone to take a picture of you well my guess is the air selfie is going to be the perfect product for you okay I mean I'll give it this this is impressively small and light considering that this is a drone this is a camera system and I mean this is a computer of sorts you know there's supposedly an AI powered autofly feature on board plus also really nice quality finish it very much feels like one of those teenage engineering style very high quality toy type projects then I'm just thinking surely surely this camera is not so amazing that it's worth keeping a drone in your back pocket at all times so in theory okay we're technically Airborne although I'm not doing anything right now why are you moving it's like when a fly is trying to escape from having flown indoors oh my God you're trying to kill me can you come down please please please please please ah okay so propellers automatically turn off when it reaches your hand that's pretty cool so what I want to try here is autoly it should follow me oh all right so I've got it on face mode hello don't care oh dear Cal down no that's not okay yeah okay I can see my face where are where are you going where are you going I'm here oh my there's a lot of people around here that are wondering what just happened the thing so tiny no one saw anything technically I could take off from here don't do that probably shouldn't do that oh it's there as you can see though the quality is absolutely atrocious I've in almost broad daylight and I look like a shadow right let's see if I can get this face tracking to work okay it's technically technically locked onto my face what kind of artificial intelligence is this okay look here's the thing this has so many features like it can do a wide shot of you it can go far away and do a zoom shot of you it can fly off take a little video and then come back to you but the fundamentals of this drone are just not even close to good enough to be able to pull them off in a way that anyone would use I'm feeling like a 3 out of 10 but if you're not a photo kind of person there's another way that you can self- indulge for $150 with a personalized toaster uh did they actually include a real cooked slice of bread so anyways this toaster the Jesus toaster is that what I bought I'm completely lost this is probably the weirdest thing I've ever unboxed so uh what's it like to use now I got to say for $150 you expect a pretty good slice of bread coming out of it but this does look an awful lot like a generic toaster with some little metal plates added inside of it oh craigy that's me every part of this really does scream made in someone's garage so I imagine the way this works is you've got heating elements behind and then this metal plate blocks off those heating elements except for Within These gaps here so I assume my face is going to be the toasted part of this toast so bad is it's hard to get bre you say bre all right let's just cut to the chase how am I going to taste while we let that do its thing check this out you can now ask the Arya AI baked into the Opera browser to literally generate an image at the to of a button actually we can see how this compares to the toaster make a toast with a realistic face to post on Instagram oh oh is absolutely horrifying but yeah if you're going to do something cursed might as well do it properly and it's not just that it now also understands the images that you give it oh I think our toast is ready that is absolutely atrocious is that my face which one's AR this is definitely properly toasted I mean look at the back of it it's just this whole metal plate mechanism is well it's not good so let's say I want to confirm whether or not this is in fact a face on my toast let's ask is this a face on my toast the first image is clearly a photoshopped image of a face on toast the second image shows a piece of toast with some burn mark s that vaguely resemble a face but it's not a clear or intentional image but also this is the only browser where literally every single thing is one click away if someone's airing you whatsapp's right here you want to listen to music while working the music player is down here I don't even want to spoil the rest just give it a go using my link in the description I guess this is my plate crispy two out of 10 products at Max a stationary vacuum cleaner cuz if only there was some way to bring a vacuum cleaner straight to the mess you wanted to clean H Maybe by 2100 we'll have figured that one out I'm actually puzzled right now with how many fingerprints are on this thing I mean the thing is brand new and it's meant to be a cleaning product but seriously I am beused this is called the ivac home but what is the actual benefit of it in the home so these right here are infrared sensors they detect when rubbish gets within range of the vacuum and then that turns on the motor on the inside which according to these guys removes no joke 100% of dust hair and debris so that's going to have to be a very powerful motor so I have prepared a little cocktail to test this thing of trash yes cooking is my passion don't ask where it came from but it's all to answer one simple question how close does trash have to get to this vacuum for it to detect it and suck it up right nothing at 50 cm nothing at 40 nothing at 30 20 [Applause] 10 so technically it has detected the trash I don't even think it's removed 1% of it okay well let's see what happens when you push it closer oh W wo W and now it's self-destructed is it is it dead what it did suck up it did with tremendous Force but I mean what now okay okay I see I see only cycles for 7 Seconds at a time so that you I guess don't end up with a vacuumed cat I still don't understand why in a home setting because like I guess yeah if you have a couple of specks of dirt sitting 30 cm away from it then it's not such a big deal to kick them towards it and maybe it will detect some of them but then also what if the rubbish is all the way over here if you had a traditional vacuum cleaner you can take it to that spot and suck it up but here you have to take that rubbish and manually push it all the way towards your vacuum cleaner off crying out loud and the infrared sensors are not even picking up the individual piece of rubbish they literally have to see the broom also notice how the dirtiest part of this whole kitchen is the area directly in front of this vacuum cleaner okay I'm tired of this thing here's some burnt face [Music] toast zero out of 10 ah yes the belt that's also a power bank I think the most money I've ever spent on a belt before this one is about $30 so this better be something special oh so the belt comes separate and then the Buckle SL power bank is this meaty thing in here oh dear uh this is not one of my better peels I apologize so it is a handmade leather belt which immediately gives it some value oh this is cool so it looks like they've designed their own custom one siiz fits-all solution so they've hot print Ed a whole load of these different ratchets directly onto the leather and then this Buckle allows you to just stop at any point on any of them to confirm your size as someone whose belt size seems to consistently fall somewhere in between two of the Buckle holes this is how you do it for me right let's put it on and I think it's time to find out how much can this actually charge your phone dis can I borrow your phone please oh this is actually where it comes in handy um drisha likes to keep her battery on the very very edge so it's on 15% right now then the cable for this thing they package it like it's a forensic specimen I can kind of see why because like have they not heard of USB C to C I've just realized one of these is a flat cable the other one is a circular cable the attention to detail right well just plugging in my belt right let's see what it can do okay it doesn't seem to work on any modern iPhone which is just bizarre so I'm going to try it on a Google pixel 8 and it does appear to be charging so we're at 15% right now so let's see where it gets to honestly I'm just not really sure what on Earth this gadget is on the face of it it very much feels like a piece of tech for the sake of being a piece of tech but let's dig deeper it's fun presentation you got to give him that it definitely feels designed for gifting oh yeah okay so it's not got power baked inside of it so you need to plug it in at all times oh no oh oh that's awful that's really bad the intro animation alone dropped it a couple of points so this is basically five customizable pixel art displays each with a 128x 128 resolution it actually does look a lot like they just taped five Apple watch faces together so I feel like how useful this is rests on what you're going to be able to put on those displays so let's have a look oh I see so there's two types of faces you get ones that span every single screen in a pre-configured way or you can individually decide what you're placing on every single one of them and there is a massive gallery of Stills and animations that you can apply to it let's have a look at one of the pre-made ones oh you can have um one of those Nixie tube clocks and it doesn't look that great I mean for starters the screens don't fill the entire area but also they're LCDs which means that they very much look like screens nothing about the contrast or the color reproduction is at all convincing oh you can display your YouTube channel subscribe count like the name of this tile is YouTube video list so if I click yes oh okay so it's got the date it's got the time the subscriber count the The View count is that right do we have 5,681 million views I feel like when I was very early on in the channel this is the kind of thing I was looking for I did love the idea of tracking every single new subscriber you know what this feels like this feels like the most designed for Tik Tok product I think I've ever gotone hands on with everything is designed to look fun and interesting from a distance but it doesn't do anything a phone doesn't already do and it's not very good quality and in a pretty similar vein of potentially not necessary screens it's time we find out what on Earth is going on with these Eco earphones cuz I mean these things are more expensive than a set of airpods pro it's all a little bit slicker than I was expecting and it says right on the home menu long press to chat GPT 40 that I was not expecting hey uh translate this to Hindi I'm never going to give you up who okay I mean it's not technically something you can't have on your phone but one tap from your home menu to get access to gbt 40 like that is I me it's already better than most of those AI pin products wait a second that looks an awful lot like a a SIM card tray we get a sim tool oh wow okay so out of my Samsung phone and into my earphones can you try and text me oh my God wait that worked you're texting my earphones right now it's actually such a tiny screen that it's painful to write on like my my thumbs are aching my neck is atrociously bent over and every single word I type is wrong so let's see what else we can do so you swipe to the side and you've got access to a bunch of installed apps and then there's a store so you got Spotify you've got eom music which I guess is their own music service title okay so this is by no means the full Google Play Store but it's a specific selection of apps that they've decided could be useful on your earphones some of these menus give away that it's actually built on a very old version of Android something like Android 7 or 8 I'm going to say but they've just dressed it up very nicely there with let me just log in oh my God got to do it on this keyboard okay all right give me like 10 minutes oh my God can't believe I'm doing this we're in business this is Spotify it is absolutely miniature I don't know like when would you choose to browse Spotify this way as opposed to just taking your phone out of your pocket but the big Flagship feature that they keep honking on about with these earphones is the real time translation take this thing for a spin let's do it okay okay you so this is called dual earbud mode so you click the right earbud Let's Go Spanish you said see hola yoy Joseph okay so it said hello I am hose I heard me as well which is interesting there's a decent delay this is a slightly worse version of the translation that exists with both Google and Samsung now right so let me try um hey where is the library okay so it works from the the yeah it's pretty good so what did you hear I heard oh yeah Desta which is I think correct the quality just isn't there for what is supposed to be more expensive than it's not there but the systems are kind of in place like it's co that the transcript is available on there it's called that you can activate via the stems of the earphones but the quality and the latency needs work yeah I like that the different colors that's nice it's like very clean UI if you were able to fit all of the text on there it's weird that it's cutting off its own text when it knew the size of it own actually should probably just listen to how they sound as earphones okay Spotify well they definitely sound better than they feel the moment you take them out you think what is this cheap plasticky thing okay I mean I just feel like this is yet another textbook example of one tech product trying to do two very separate things and doing neither as well as having two separate Tech products and to be honest even if you had just $350 to spend and you needed to buy both a phone and a pair of earphones I would probably still recommend you buy a separate phone and pair of earphones it's just you do not want to use this screen for your main smartphone at $350 then the second most expensive product in this video this is the bartesian and I guess you could say it's kind of like the coffee maker of cocktails and man is this an unexpectedly weighty bit of Kit my first thought is actually like quite a few of the products in this video this feels surprisingly high quality I've tested a lot of viral Tik Tok Gadgets in my time and usually the whole appeal is this does something cool and this doesn't cost a lot of money and so when you actually get them in your hand you're like oh this is made of very cheap plastic but not actually the case here all these canisters are proper glass got a proper heavyduty rubber mat as well underneath so let's break down the value proposition here the way they try and sell this thing is if you live in a big city and you go out and you get a cocktail you're probably going to pay about $15 for that drink using one of these bartesian capsules and it's apparently $225 per drink okay so capsule goes in like so and actually I've just realized there is a barcode reader up there which is presumably scanning the barcode on the capsule to identify what drink you're trying to make although then that does mean this is only going to work with Barian branded capsules M all right it says place a highball glass with ice under the dispenser oh well I know just the way to get some ice in here let's go honeycomb I think I'm going to use this tray every single time I make a cocktail from now on okay bigger cup that's how it's done then you get to select your spirit strength so we'll go light and then you click mix and then the idea is that it draws the spirit it needs to use to make that drink from one of these canisters in the sides wow that was fast that was really fast so is that just [Music] done oh having some mix maybe while we're out of this might improve the the flavor it really did just need a mix good soup so on one hand I get it this makes sense to me I understand why it's popular it's cool it's a centerpiece and it makes drinks really quickly but then if you properly think about it what is it actually doing it's not cooling the drinks down you need an ice cube it's not carbonating the drinks everything that comes out of it is still it's barely even mixing them you need a spoon for that the only thing that it is doing is making sure that your drink has the correct amount of spirit and it's not too strong but then I just feel like soak at a shot glass so fancy fun pretty pointless four out of 10 oh actually as promised before we continue let's see what's inside this spoon start by peeling off the rubber at the back I'm very curious any predictions what tech is hiding underneath oh I see a battery a FL a few moments later time and two finger slices later we inside and so we have a battery this metal contact point is literally nothing more than a metal contact point but if you follow the lead from that battery it goes all the way into an LED light over here and nothing else so the spoon Tech is not just a spoon it's a spoon and a light time for the most expensive product of them all the $1,400 device devices that claim to have reinvented walking it's an extremely heavy box so we take this layer off and then nice it's a cool bag does not smell good though that is straight off the lines and then the moon Walkers below that so I know what you're thinking shoes with wheels at the bottom designed to make you faster skates they're called skates but actually that's specifically what the brand is trying to get away from because apparently you genuinely do just walk this isn't like skating because you're not needing to learn new skill I won't lie to you now that I've got these things here in person the efficiency part of my brain is actually very much excited to see how much time I could potentially save and how fun this could be as far as putting them on uh kind of intuitive but a little bit of a faf you have these magnetic tags that latch on and then you tighten using the velcro and then you basically just hold the power button on the back of each shoe I absolutely love the fact that there's no phone app it's actually really refreshing for everything you need to just be on the products themselves so now both lights are green which shows me they're active okay right and now in theory I just walk this is my first time ever actually doing this are these skates or is this walking reinvented uh okay all right all right oh my god oh I am moving oh no car car car car car car oh it's a really interesting feeling it feels like the gravitational pull beneath my feet has just increased tfold it's weird I can definitely feel the power beneath my feet oh oh I'm starting to get it okay so you have to put a little bit more pressure down you almost have to be it's kind of like riding a bike the more confidence with which you do it the better you're going to be at it oh my goodness Conquering the uphill terrain it feels secure and Powerful wow okay we're going now I can say with absolute certainty I've never walked at this pace before like I've tried to balance on some pretty odd vehicles in my time this doesn't feel like one of them honestly I'm pretty impressed if the reason that your walking places is to burn more calories then going faster using a device like this makes zero sense but if you're walking a lot of places because you have to walk a lot of places then by all means this is a faster cooler way of doing that not pointless at all really 8 out of 10 oh and actually while we're at it the belt so the phone is on it's on 12% it's been charging this entire time it shows it's been charging this entire

'longitude': -1.1549892, 'altitude': 0}","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"this is my dream everyday carry 2024 I've been optimizing this every day for the last year in the background and I think it's finally perfect so let's talk about it so it all starts with the backpack this is the gtic 30 L travel pack I've probably been through 15 backpacks leading up to this one and it is by far the best it's weather resistant so I feel pretty comfortable doing this even when there is a lot of valuable stuff on the inside it distributes weight really well so things feel lighter than they are but the single biggest thing is I think you'll be absolutely shocked by how much you can fit in here you'll see as I unpack so when you're crafting a perfect everyday carry I think it's important to have some rules these are mine number one every single Gadget charges with USBC number two there are no gimmicks here everything has a function number three function over form but sometimes you can have both and number four dark mode everything just because it looks cool okay let's start on the outside so in the right hand pocket this is the fagun mini a strangely shaped device that's basically the most powerful massage gun you can get in this compact form factor and of course golden rule number one charges with USBC but there is something else on this side this is an air tag it's in one of these Ultra solid hyper rugged cases and it's got a thick braided metal wire so you shouldn't be able to cut through it but even if you do there's actually a second hidden air tag within the inner lining of this bag it didn't come with it I put that in but it's a really cool tip that I learned from my good friend technical gury in India that's proper two Factor security so you've got to have a dedicated sunglasses pocket in a bag cuz there's something about sunglasses they just they disappear at the first opportunity and you might be thinking well eron that's a tiny pocket for a pair of sunglasses yes but these are the Rove sunglasses I featured them in my finnest tech video and they are just so awesome they're basically folding sunglasses but just with the thinnest possible frame and they do not actually feel nearly as flimsy as you'd expect to given that then the other thing in this pocket and by the way they're also felt lines so these are super comfy pockets is a pen just cuz you sometimes need to write stuff this is actually my lucky pen back when I was doing my high school exams I spent a long time researching pens I was trying to find the single pen that had the lowest friction coefficient so that I was as streamlined as possible while writing out my essays and this jet stream is like a $2 pen that does that so I keep it with me everywhere now and then on the left side this is the chili Series 2 water bottle find the idea of water bottles having a series 2 so funny Next Generation water but yeah the most important thing for me with the water bottle was making absolute sure that it's leak proof I realize it doesn't look like that right now because I dipped this backpack in water earlier but it's also got a couple of extra niceties it can keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot so sometimes it's water sometimes it's black coffee it's got a really interesting lip that makes it weirdly comfortable to drink from and then it's also got this rubber base so it's not clanging around as you pick it up and put it down we'll put that there I'm trying to turn this into a really aesthetic unpacking oh also what's really cool about these side pockets is when they're empty they're magnetized so they sit completely flush with the bag now front pockets I realize how this looks it's actually much more tragic um this is a bag of tea I really like my home tea bags and no hotel that I go to seems to be able to match them and these are Milo's treats I have a very needy cat good boy and a sub to the channel would be all delicious to some oh yeah other thing I love about this bag is most of the backpacks I tested I pretty much end up filling every single available pocket this thing has so many that I probably still got like eight spare this was one of my main criteria when searching for a backpack is that when you unzip the compartment it opens completely flat and the beauty of this is you get to your hotel room on the other side of wherever you're traveling to and this is your suitcase and this actually opens completely flat like this both in the front compartment and the back compartment but I'm getting to the back front first four more pockets on the side I don't even know what to do with all of them but I'm using the bottom two because one of them actually has something quite cool this is a retractable key holder so this is where I keep my backup keys and what's quite reassuring about this leash is that I know for absolute certainty that my keys will be in this pocket when I open the bag I've also recently come around to the idea of these key organizers and then when you want to use them you just swivel them out like this tuck them back in and on the other side is my wallet this is a Pokémon Center X Fossil wallet and it doesn't really have any redeeming features it's it's just a Pokémon wallet but there is one cool thing that I want to show you here this is the chipolo item finder and functions in a very similar way to an air tag it's just the form factor is much better suited for slipping into a wallet like a card okay this is where things get fun so this is the belroy toiletry kit plus and I really like these belroy bags the material is both very reassuring but also holds it shape quite well and the Zips also feel really high quality and this is actually I keep all of my smaller Electronics in and it just makes sense because one bag keeps everything together it means that you know if you have that bag you have everything you need and also airport security this is all the stuff that's going to get you stopped so you might as well get it all through in one go so it starts with the anchor Prime power bank this thing has a 27,600 Mah capacity and 250 WS worth of charging power I went crazy with this this is very high spec but the way I see it the power bank is the center of my entire e system every single Gadget I carry with me can be powered by this but also it can do some pretty cool stuff like if I accidentally leave it somewhere how many power Banks do you know that have a speaker built in oh yeah but also there's another reason I went for this and it's because anchor has a pretty good ecosystem so these are anchor charging bases and they're specifically designed to magnetically connect to these Prime power Banks to keep them charged up so this is the one place where we like to keep all the gadgets in the entire house charged up and we used to do it in the this really kind of clunky way with these massive bricks and cables sprawling across the entire thing but because these charging bases have separate ports on the sides to charge your other products all of our Tech can basically be powered by just two of these anytime I come back from a trip I take the used power bank drop it on and then I take one that I know is absolutely going to be full and I just repack it oh yeah this is a beautiful invention this is the maax 100 wat Universal travel adapter I didn't know this existed until a couple of weeks ago this is your adapter and your charger in one device so there's four ports at the bottom which is the maximum number of things I'm realistically going to be charging at any one time and that final one at the end that's powerful enough for a laptop and then here you plug in anything requiring a wall outlet and that can be us Australia UK Europe and it turns it into US Australia UK Europe so this one product covers the wall charging needs of every single piece of tech that I bring with me and you can also get a bigger 140 WT version but 100 actually works just fine for the stuff I carry there's yet more hidden Zips inside of here and so this one has my sim ejector tour yes I went for The Dark Knight this came as part of a limited edition Batman phone it's kind of sick airpods Pro 2 the only light thing I own but that's because it's technically a Mr who's the boss Edition they're not quite what I would call a true Hi-Fi experience but there's not really a way to currently get that with wireless inar earphones so from everything I've tested this is the best combo of sound isolation but then also battery life and so upon coming to that conclusion I decided to last year get one of these made for every single member of our team so everyone has the Mr who the boss logo on the front and then they have their name written on the back oh yeah and the actual airpods themselves are also white and blue these are the Zeiss lens wipes I used to carry around a microfiber cloth all the time but I feel like when your screen reaches a certain level of fingerprin iness it just doesn't cut it and these are the only things I found that do because they're Co with a few chemicals that just instant wipe the dirtiest of screens but I only use them when I need to that's actually perfectly fallen into a really aesthetic position this is one of my Staples the span ire and before deciding on this I did play around with loads of stuff more like this which has multiple interchanging heads like you can do lightning you can do micro USB USBC usba but as I was putting this backpack together it became very clear to me that if you're buying good quality modern technology you don't need anything else apart from USBC and that really is such a blessing because it means you can just buy one or two really good quality USBC cables and that is everything you need and so the reason I went with The Arc wire is exactly that it's one very good USBC cable it's incredibly reliable incredibly thick as well as you can probably tell so this isn't going to break on me it's going to be able to charge my stuff it's going to be able to data transfer very very fast by the way and also it's Thunderbolt 4 so I can use this to hook my iPad up to a massive 5K monitor if I wanted to there's a backup SD card in here in case I a donut and I forget my main one SD card adapter for the iPad Pro which fixes the one key port that it's missing compared to a Macbook one more USBC cable and then this this is the ESR ch2 wireless charger and these guys are sponsoring this video but this is genuinely what I'm carrying around every single day it's very light it folds like a wallet so it's a really easy shape to shove in a pocket or a tech bag like this it charges up to three things at once so in my Cas that's my phone my earphones and my Apple watch but then also this is second generation Chi charging so the phone charging is twice as powerful as normal CH Chargers and your watch charging is four times and the really cool part of this is look the watch charger is completely removable so if I just want to charge my watch without the other stuff this plugs straight into the power bank ESR does also do this really cool 3in one watch charging set again removable watch charger which is very cool but I think it's more for home than travel and Alo this magnetic Wireless car charger and it's all ch2 plus ESR stuff is really well priced so Link in the description if you want to check it out and the wireless charging is actually quite a nice segue into this so this is my phone this is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra and the high level summary is I really like it the battery life never lets me down it just I feel like every single year it gets harder and harder to straddle ecosystems so using a Samsung phone while most of the rest of my stuff is primarily designed around Apple products but I have some somewhat managed to save myself from this because you know after that phone repair video where we went around and we basically came to the conclusion that the entire phone repair industry is a bit of a mess I got myself a case and what I really like about this case is that a obviously it protects the phone B it has a stand baked into the bottom which works in both orientations but see it gives my Samsung mag safe so I can just do this this pit isn't even sponsored by ESR but that's an ESR case and then on that note this is the Apple Watch series 9 it's not the best looking Smartwatch I strongly prefer the more circular designed ones like the Galaxy watch and the pixel watch but this thing has changed my life you know just like the airpods as a separate gift we actually got everyone in our team one of these two and we've been using it to create this internal fitness challenge where every two months we Crown a winner based on who has achieved their own Fitness objectives the best and so this has basically become my personal accountability tool I know that every single person on this team is going to be able to see what I get up to today and then the strap I'm using is literally a 50 c strap I got from a fake Apple watch that I bought in India I'm just wearing it in protest of how expensive the real ones are by the way isn't it already kind of crazy how much stuff I've managed to take out the bag and how little of the bag we've actually emptied now this is the second belroy wash bag uh this one is not the plus this is the standard size and I got a brown one just so I can tell immediately at a glance which one is which and yes this one actually does have toiletries in it and it's at this point that you can probably start to see my objectives with this bag I am in the lucky position where I often get a lot of spontaneous opportunities come up someone will email me and say Aaron do you want to be in Spain in 3 days time and my whole life before I got this all together that would stress me out because all of a sudden in those 3 days I had to fit in running up and down the house getting every single little bit that I could possibly need take it away from its original intended position and put it all together in a bag in a way that it fits but what is so beautiful about this setup is that it's designed so that if I want to go somewhere now all I need to do is spend a minute and a half putting three sets of clothes in and I'm off so hair styling powder I found that to be way better than wax or gel I always carry around two individually wrapped hand sanitizers just in case you go to a bathroom and there's no soap or you cut yourself it's good to disinfect folding toothbrush which just makes too much sense because it keeps the head of the toothbrush clean while also picking up half the normal footprint sadly could not find this in dark mode and then one more cool thing about this belroy bag is a little magnetic latch and behind which is the Gillette Labs razor which is the best razor I've ever used because it moves in two different axes it's got a little exfoliating bar but also if you ever end up in need of a little bit of self-defense that went further the first time I did it I have no idea why they needed to turn it into a projectile but you just never know and then just just to show you how much other stuff fits in here moisturizer suncream mini mouthwash antiperspirant perfume oh this one's actually fun this is also a perfume but it was designed by a robot and apparently algorithmically tuned to my preferences there's a short on our Channel where I got this made toothpaste backup painkiller and the last thing is my EpiPen I have a very severe peanut allergy so I always need to know where this is right just before we get to the very back of the bag there's three t shirts fit in here and I might as well show you because a few people have asked me so I found these in Japan the brand is called Theory and they are by far the most expensive t-shirts I own but the material is so high quality and heavy that I tend to wear these to even smart events and also they barely need any ironing which is perfect for something that you have to keep shoved in a bag shorts which also double as swim shorts so I don't need to pack two separate things and then cargo trousers um I used to be a jeans guy my entire life but as soon as this became a socially seable thing to wear I was all in on it because you have like a th000 Pockets now oh yeah and all underwear is in a separate middle compartment but we don't need to review that need some more space on this table socks underwear I'm only putting this out cuz I'm trying to show you the sheer holding capacity of this bag and do you want to know probably the single coolest part of it it is this this ZIP right here so what you've seen up until this point is a 20 L backpack a very generous 20 L back pack you can fit a lot in there but if I open this and it goes all the way around this is now a 30 L backpack and the reason I've gone for something that does that is in case I also want to carry this this is our camera bag and for quite a while we've actually been using this $20 Amazon Basics camera bag but over time as we figured out exactly the things we need and nothing more we've transitioned to the belroy camera sling there are some really cool things about it like for example how often do you see a bag where you can zip it one way but you can also zip it entirely from the other direction to open it and long story short this perfectly fits everything that we possibly need on our shoot days my camera which is the Sony A7 S3 the microphone we've got three different key lenses oh and this this is the aperture MC Pro it's like a tiny little light that's an entire studio in one Gadget I'll just show you how bright it is so first of all that's crazy considering how well lit this room already is with massive soft boxes plus magnetic attachments on the back you can equip a soft box for the front which massively softens the light on your face you can also magnetically attach a honeycomb which restricts the light to only shooting in One Direction so that you can perfectly light yourself without needing to bleed into the background and then you can do both at the same time not to mention like any color you could possibly want we've got our microphones and again every single thing USBC and you might be thinking well Ain you got a camera that camera is not going to be USBC is it well hidden Pocket time so in here I have five spare batteries for our Sony camera and yeah these are traditionally designed to kind of slot in place in one of those archaic camera battery chargers but also we have found batteries that have a USBC Port which means yes we can charge these using the same anchor power base that we use to charge the power bank and everything else but yeah the camera bag is just a fun little and yes it actually does fit inside of the go Matic bag but we're not actually quite done with this yet cuz this is the back pocket opens flat and so right now in this back I have three things iPad Pro 13 in apple magic keyboard and the apple pencil Pro and it's kind of crazy to say but this this little 5 mm thin machine has become my entire workstation when I'm outside the house it can do all of my laptop things but also so much more like idea generation I'm constantly sketching things with this apple pencil actually funnily enough even the plan for the thumbnail of this video also this is such a good Netflix machine for when you're on the plane plus I also ended up going for the cellular model so this thing has its own data connection and I'm not hotspotting from anything which just makes it faster so yeah the iPad Pro M4 has officially become my Mac away from home but the crazy part of it is the bag is so big I could could have fit in a Mac 2 let me know if you enjoyed this slightly more impromptu video and maybe we'll turn it into a series catch you in the next one"

(bright electronic music) - All right, so you've
heard of flipping phones, you've heard of folding phones, but technology never slows down. So welcome to a phone with both. The world's first tri-fold phone. This thing, this is the Huawei
Mate XT, is what it's called. So I'd heard about this thing,
I'd seen some videos online, but it was also a Huawei
phone, so it was China-only. So knowing that I'm never
gonna daily-drive it, I didn't wanna, like, get too caught up. But it's so interesting. Like, I just had so many questions like, what is it like to use? What are the creases like? Like, what are the trade-offs? How hard is it to carry
a triple-folding phone? What are the case is like? Why is it called a tri-fold when it only technically folds twice? I need answers. So I was like, ""All right, I
need to get my hands on one."" I reached out to dbrand and asked, like, ""Can you guys get me a
contact where I can buy one?"" And I never asked questions, but they're always able to pull it off. And they did. So I spent the money,
I imported the thing, and now I can give you a tour
of the tri-fold experience. So let us start with just
when it's closed, right? When it's closed, you have a pretty reasonable
6.4-inch-sized phone. Well, I mean, you know,
reasonable from the front anyway. If you're just looking at it, using it, the screen gets plenty bright. It is 90 hertz. And then, somehow, the
bezels are pretty thin and even all the way around. The top and the bottom,
the left and the right. And actually, of course, the right side is the screen curving around the edge, so the software appropriately creates a fourth bezel to match. And it looks honestly
more like a normal phone than a lot of the other
foldables out there. So then, using it, you know,
you pretty quickly feel that it is thicker than a normal phone. But what's crazy is each
of these slices (chuckles) individually is ridiculously
thin, about four millimeters. So, in total, they add up to 13 millimeters thick when it's closed. Which would be pretty thick
if it was a slab phone, but that's actually about the same as a lot of the other single
folds, like the Z Fold 6. So then the power button/fingerprint
reader combo button and the volume buttons
on the right side here, they're pushed a little
bit back of the center. Not the end of the world. Totally usable. You're obviously gonna notice
that parts of the screen are a bit exposed and vulnerable if you're gonna put it in a pocket or in a backpack or something. But overall, just as a regular-sized single-screen smartphone experience, this is actually really respectable. This is like an eight out of 10, really close to the best
I've seen, which is awesome. But then you open it for the first time, and from here, you get
to the small tablet mode. So, yes, size-wise, now
we're basically matching a lot of the other
folding phones out there, like Pixel Fold, Samsung
Z Fold, et cetera. This is a 7.9-inch diagonal, that is roughly a square aspect ratio. I'll be honest, it looks fine, but I actually don't really
think it was meant to operate in this form factor most of the time. I mean, why stop halfway when you're just one more
fold away from greatness? But it is clearly
perfectly usable like this. The crease, your first
crease, is impressively small and very easy to ignore when
you're actually using it. But yeah, thin bezels all the way around. Again, blacked-out pixels on the far left-hand side this time. And there's also still a couple
little folding phone tricks, like, of course, since the
main camera is on the back and there's no selfie
camera on these two panes, then this is the perfect
time to take a selfie with the main camera, but get a full-sized preview
on the 6.4-inch screen that's still wrapped
around the other side. And they are really good flagship quality triple cameras, by the way. I'll get to that in a second. You, of course, get all the other benefits of the display spec: the
brightness, the 90 hertz. It's really solid. Obviously, it's just a little awkward that, like, it's twice as
thick in one hand as the other, which is a little unbalanced. And then, it is glass on one side and then, the, like, sort of
leather material on the other. So, it's a little bit weird in that way, but honestly, still very impressive. I feel like this is
like a seven out of 10. Still pretty close, but
you know, we're not done. So this is what we're all here for, the final fold, which opens this thing up to a full 10.2-inch
corner-to-corner display. So this is now a full 3,184 by 2,232 90-hertz OLED display, thin bezels all the way around, amazingly, with a hole-punch selfie
camera over to the left side, two creases, two hinges. And yeah, this is not an iPad Mini-sized screen in your pocket. This is literally a full-sized 10-inch tablet in your pocket,
which is actually incredible. Now, the more you play with it, the more you start to
notice little quirks, like, first of all, it's ridiculously thin now that it's all open. It's actually kind of
disorienting to hold the tablet with a screen this big,
but bezels this small, and, like, the whole thing is this thin, it's just kind of a marvel. And then you look at the creases plural, 'cause now you got two, and you can actually see
there is a small difference between the inward folding
crease on the right side and the outward folding
crease on the left. But they are also, actually,
both impressively small. But, like, yeah, this... I'm actually kind of
sad that I can't, like, fully daily drive something
like this 'cause it is Huawei. Like, you can kind of hack your way into getting some Google services on here. But a lot of this UI, a lot of this OS is still Chinese only. Like, it's not gonna be great. It's probably missing
some bands in the US, too. But just, wow. It's a good amount of software tweaks for the triple-fold thing, too. Like when you fully unfold
it, the whole UI stretches out but is still one page on each side. So they've kind of just
played this animation to stretch out two pages
among three panels, but the animation's pretty smooth. And there is a wrong way to
fold it, too, by the way. And it tells you about it. So obviously, you can
close it pretty easily. The correct way to unfold it is to get the two on the inside, but if you unfold it the
wrong way, like that, it actually tells you. It says, ""Fold it a different way to use the device, please. You're kind of doing
something weird here."" Which totally fair, I'll
get it right next time. You kind of have to... There is a little learning
curve to according... ""According?"" Accordioning quickly every time. But yeah, this has to be a 10 out of 10. I mean, there's the fact
that I'm able to fit a, look at the size of
this, a 10-inch display, reasonably in my pocket. That by itself is something
that no other device can do. So I gotta love that. Another question I had early
when playing with this is... I mean, people put cases on every phone. What are cases for this phone like? Turns out it does come
with a case in the box, which is this thing. And so, really, it is just
one back piece of the phone that it can protect
when it's fully closed. So this case snaps onto the
back of the phone like this and then protects also a little
bit of the exposed screen on the side, so it makes sense. They don't wanna get any debris in there. And then it has a kickstand on the back, which can rotate around and support it at a couple
of various different angles. So you can watch videos like
this if you're into that. And it can also rotate out of the way to expose the wireless charging coils because it turns out this phone
also has wireless charging, and if you just flip it
sideways on certain charges, you can get it to line up and
work with wireless charging. So that's one type of person who will use the kickstand
built into the case. But there is another type
of person, by the way, a total reckless psycho that
would unfold it like this and then use the phone itself
as a built-in kickstand. And it totally works. Like, the UI responds to it, and you can watch, you know, YouTube on a larger part of the screen, but you're also totally scratching the outside part of the screen
you're using as a kickstand. So yeah, I'm obviously
not gonna recommend that. In case you're also wondering about specs on something like this. It's fit flagship specs inside, despite being these crazy
thin slivers of a phone. It's the flagship
seven-nanometer Kirin 9010 chip made by Huawei. It is also up to 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage, which is crazy. And triple cameras on
the back, as you can see. That's a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide,
and a telephoto. And there's a 5,600
milliamp-hour battery chopped up and distributed in here
with 67-watt fast charging and 50-watt wireless charging,
which is kind of insane. And then the whole thing will retail... It's in China, so if you sort
of do the conversion price, this, like, top-end model
with the terabyte of storage is like $3,500. So $3,000 to $3,500 US. That's actually not
that much more expensive than some of the highest-end
folds that we have. So why is this the only tri-fold phone? Maybe that's the main
question you're wondering after all of this. Because it's so cool. It's just the fact that I can actually fit all of this in the dimensions of something that fits
in my pocket is nuts. And they've done a lot of things with, like, nice software touches that actually make it feel
really well-considered. But yeah, there are also
some trade-offs, of course. I think the biggest weakness on paper is gonna be the battery, the
5,600 milliamp-hour battery. You know, fast charging
is great, obviously, so that can offset it. But the more time you use this wide open with the 10 inches of screen, the tougher that's
gonna be on the battery. You know, if you look at
typical larger tablets, even the thin ones, the 10-inch
tablets are having, like, 8,000-plus milliamp-hour
batteries pretty often. So that's probably the
biggest weakness here. The speakers are also truly terrible. It's interesting 'cause they come out of the right-hand corner
and the left-hand corner when it's open, but it's
so thin, there's just... It's physics, there's not enough room for big chambers for huge speakers. So, yeah, the speakers are
pretty tinny, pretty bad. And then, there is no IP rating for dust or water resistance. Some of the newer foldables
have water resistance now. This one, not so much. And then, of course, the price is obviously gonna keep some people away. But honestly, that's a pretty
small list of trade-offs for something that is so,
like, shockingly different and new, that I'm impressed. This had the potential to be like the world's greatest concept phone. Remember concept phones
from a couple years ago? I was like, it's getting kind of weird that people are, like, showing off phones they're never gonna make. This could have been the
coolest concept phone ever. But then they just went and decided to actually make
a bunch of them and ship 'em. This phone also just happens to have a variable aperture
lens on the main camera, so it can switch between f/1.4 wide open for some real background bokeh to f/4 and getting more things in focus. It happens to also have
that insanely fast charging. It comes with an 80-watt charging brick, and it has fast wireless charging in a body barely thick enough
to have an entire USB-C port. It happens to come with this
pre-installed screen protector that I'm just never gonna remove. It's crazy. There's just so much going on here that in this world of so
many phones just being, ""Oh, all phones are the same these days. It's just a little
different from last year. Not a whole lot has changed,"" I gotta hand it to projects like this. This is just insane. (laughs) They didn't have to go this hard. They didn't have to go
this hard, but they did. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (bright electronic music)"

jHP942Livy0,"Your dishwasher is better than you think (tips, tricks, and how they work)",Let your dishwasher do the work for you! Links 'n' stuff: The Connextras video on my dishwasher's program change-up: ...,Technology Connections,2024-06-11T15:38:41Z,28,[],PT27M47S,4400391,10734,,[],True,"If you’ve got a dishwasher that you think kinda sucks, there’s a good chance that with just a few tweaks to how you use it
you can get truly clean dishes with very little effort. Hi. I’m apparently the internet’s weird appliance guy, and a few years ago I made two videos on dishwashers
and more specifically dishwasher detergent. Together, they’re the length of a feature film! And you don’t have time for that, so I’ve created this new version. Which begins… now. First, I want you to know that you can absolutely 
load a dishwasher with filthy stuff just covered in crap. I do it all the time! The only prep you should need to do when loading a dishwasher is scrape off large pieces of uneaten food. The machine can handle a lot on its own, even burnt-on stuff. But it’s important to understand that dishwashers are
actually very simple machines doing a very simple thing. If you ever looked in there at the spray arms and thought
“that looks an awful lot like one of those twirly lawn sprinklers” you were having a correct thought! This machine could sincerely be described
as a couple of those sprinklers inside a waterproof box. The box has racks which allow you to conveniently position stuff you want to clean like plates and bowls and flatware above those sprinklers so that they spray all that stuff with lots and lots of water to get it squeaky clean. But dishwashers don’t use lots and lots of water. In fact they use very little because the water inside is recirculated. The bottom of your dishwasher is actually a false bottom: below the mesh surface is a sump
which holds somewhere on the order of a gallon of water. That’s 3.8 liters, though I’m not being that precise because 
the amount varies from machine to machine. When the cleaning cycle begins, an inlet valve opens to allow clean water
to fill the sump, usually through a hole in the side wall. Once full, the valve closes and a powerful pump
driven by an electric motor starts running. That pump forces the water through the spray arms and… that’s it. That spraying action is what cleans your dishes. It just has to go on for a while to be effective, 
hence the recirculation of water. In some machines, the water is screened through a 
washable mesh filter before it reaches the pump. Which brings me to Tip Number 1: check your dishwasher’s bottom for a removable filter and clean it. If you’ve never done this and you have a filter, I’m very sorry for what you are about to find. It will be unpleasant. You should be cleaning that filter regularly. In other machines, the pump doubles as a macerator: small blades at its intake break down bits of food like a mini garbage disposal. Those machines usually don’t have a filter,
just a grid to catch stuff that’s too big for the macerator to chew up. And, for the record, those are the only kind of dishwasher
that I will ever purchase because cleaning those filters is gross. Now, you might very well have realized that if it's the 
same water being recirculated then as the dishwasher runs the water inside of it is going to get yucky from all the food residue it's knockin' off the plates and whatnot. And yep! That water gets real nasty real quick. So the machine periodically stops the main pump and starts up a second pump which pushes the dirty water out of the machine through a drain hose. and it may also add some clean water at the same time to help purge that drain hose and the sump of all the nasty water. Once empty, the dishwasher fills itself up again with another gallon-ish of clean water
and the main pump starts back up to continue cleaning. This fill, pump for a while, then drain sequence is going to repeat a few times and by the end of the fourth or fifth fill and dump,
all the food residue will have been removed from the items inside the dishwasher and the water in the sump is clean. On the last fill the stuff inside is simply getting rinsed, and after one last draining, the cycle will end and your dishes are clean - all while using only a few gallons of water. In this case, 4.2 gallons or 16 liters. I’ve described the basics of what the machine does
to clean your dishes but I’ve skipped two important helpers: heat and chemicals. Let’s start with heat. If you’ve ever hand-washed a dirty kitchen or food thing then you’ve probably discovered that the process is a lot easier if the water you’re using is hot. This is especially true if what you’re trying to clean is at all greasy - 
the hotter the water, the more that grease softens and the more easily it will come off whatever it’s stuck to. So, a dishwasher has a heating element to heat the water inside. In many North American dishwashers that heating element is exposed at the bottom and used for a heated dry option, but top tip - you might try turning that off. I never use the heated dry because it feels like a waste of energy, 
it can damage items especially on the bottom rack, and the final rinse is quite hot anyway 
so if you empty the dishwasher right after it finishes, that water will evaporate quickly unless you live in a swamp. Even if I don’t get to it until the next morning most stuff inside is dry and I just use a dish towel for what few things
might still have a bit of water on them. But that’s just, like, my opinion. What isn't my opinion though is that it takes a while
to heat up a gallon of water with the power output of that heating element. My dishwasher at home has an 800W element
and because energy is energy and water is water, we know that it can only elevate the temperature of the water inside
by about 3 degrees Celsius per minute - and that’s assuming absolutely no heat losses. That’s a pretty leisurely temperature rise so, in North America,
dishwashers are hooked up to the hot water supply at the sink. That way the water they fill with is already hot and the heating 
element only has to raise the temperature a little bit (though it may raise it a lot in the final rinse if you have a sanitize option). Except - well, you know what your kitchen sink is like. Unless you’ve got a booster heater under there or a hot water recirculation pump,
it takes a while for the water to actually get hot when you open the tap. The cold water in the pipes between
your water heater and the sink needs to be purged and because dishwashers fill with so little water, if it takes more than just a few seconds to get hot water at your kitchen sink your dishwasher will begin washing with
lukewarm water at best and stone cold water at worst. And that’s bad, especially because the dishes are at their very dirtiest
and could really use the help of heat. Think about how much harder it is to get butter or cheese out of a pan
when the water is cold and thus isn’t softening it. So - here’s Tip Number 2: right before you start the dishwasher,
run the hot water in your kitchen sink until it’s properly hot. That way you ensure the dishwasher will actually fill with hot water. Many dishwashers - like the one you’re looking at now - don’t even bother
turning their heating element on at all during the first fill of water.   So that water will only be as hot as it was when it entered. Running the tap until it’s actually hot may be the most important tip in this video 
depending on your dishwasher’s programming. Again, though, this advice is for North Americans specifically. Many other parts of the world hook the dishwasher up to cold water
and the cycle programming is adjusted accordingly. But here they are designed to fill with (and thus expect) hot water. If you have a delay start option that might change up the programming
to account for that but... it also might not so again, if you're not happy with your dishwasher,
try running the tap until it’s steamy hot and then start it. That alone can make a huge difference. And by the way - if you try this and it doesn’t seem to be helping, you might wanna double check that your dishwasher
is actually hooked into the hot water line. You should see a water line under your sink
with a flexible hose heading towards the dishwasher. If that hose is hooked up to the cold water supply by mistake,
the machine’s performance will suffer tremendously. But you don’t just wash dishes with hot water. You’re gonna need some soap. And that’s why you have to buy detergent for your dishwasher! These chemical products contain a non-sudsing cocktail
of dispersants, surfactants, emulsifiers, and enzymes. The enzymes help to break down proteins and starches in food, and by the way those enzymes work best when the wash water is up to temperature. So if you don’t run the tap until it’s hot, you can shorten the time in the wash cycle
that the enzymes are effective which hurts washing performance. It may seem like I’m hammering that point kinda hard but I am! Because it’s important and I really want you to try
running the tap until it’s hot when you start the dishwasher. Anyway the other components in the detergent are also important: surfactants lower the surface tension of the water which helps it clean. Emulsifiers encapsulate fats and oils
which allows them to mix with the wash water. And the dispersants keep all that washed-off gunk suspended in the water so that it doesn’t create residue deposits inside the dishwasher or indeed
end up back on the stuff it’s trying to clean. There are usually a few other helper components
depending on the detergent product, and in a moment I’ll tell you the kind of
dishwasher detergent I use and recommend. Spoiler alert, it’s the cheapest kind! But first I need to draw your attention to the machine’s detergent dispenser. This little dispenser is critically important
to the proper operation of your dishwasher. If you don’t put your detergent in here and close that door,
you may very well be wrecking your machine’s cleaning performance and I cannot stress that enough. The reason this is here is because 
every time the machine gets rid of the dirty water inside of it, It also gets rid of any detergent that was in the water! And we need that detergent to clean the dishes! But - we don’t want it right away. Think about what happens when you load it up with dirty dishes -
say a bunch of plates after a big pasta dinner. Those plates are filthy and covered in red sauce. Or maybe Alfredo, doesn’t matter take your pick. When the machine starts spraying them with water, a bunch of that sauce is going to dissolve quickly,
fall off and end up in the wash water. That first fill of water is known as the pre-wash,
and since it gets dirty so quickly, the machine doesn’t spend a lot of time with it. My dishwasher only spends 10 minutes in the pre-wash before it drains that water out and fills again
for the next part of the cycle known as the main wash. If that dispenser weren’t there and holding the detergent back, then my dishwasher would only have 10 minutes
with soap in the water and then it would all be gone! So only after it has drained the nasty pre-wash water out
and replaced it with clean water for the main wash does the dispenser door open and allow the detergent into the water. The dishwasher will then spend a long time with that fill of water,
sometimes more than an hour. So actually having detergent added at the correct time
is crucial to a good cleaning performance. Although I just discovered that my fancy dishwasher is able to
tell how dirty the pre-wash water is and may switch up its programming. That is not at all a universal thing and depends on having fancy sensors -
most machines just run predefined programs so I’m not getting into this here, but if you're curious what I'm talking about -
that second channel video will explain. So Tip Number 3: Be sure to use the detergent dispenser and close it. Most of you probably already are, but I know there are some folks out there
who skip it and just throw the detergent in the tub. If your dishwasher’s detergent dispenser is broken and that’s why you aren't using it, that’s going to really hurt your machine’s performance and ideally it should be fixed - though there may be workarounds depending 
on your machine which I’ll discuss later. But you may also remember from your previous life experience 
that fats and oils don’t mix with plain water. You need an emulsifier to make them mix. Which is in the detergent... but the machine doesn’t let the detergent into the water until the second fill. So you might think that first fill is going to struggle with fats and oils. And yes it will! And that’s why many, many dishwashers have detergent dispensers like this one - where there are two compartments. One is sealed by the gasket in the detergent dispenser door and labeled Main Wash. But the pre-wash compartment right next to it isn’t sealed at all: there are holes in the door to allow any detergent you put in there to spill right out. Ya see, before grocery stores were filled with these infernal pod and pack things, dishwasher detergent came in a box like this. It was a box of powder, and you were expected to open this little spout and pour that powder into the dispenser. And if you put some of this powder in both of those cups, then the one with holes in the lid would just spill its contents out
and so the dishwasher would begin its cycle with some detergent! That meant it could tackle fats and oils immediately,
so the pre-wash was much more effective. Then, when it drained out that nasty water and filled again for the main wash, it would open the dispenser and let out
a second round of detergent to replace what just got pumped out. That second fill would have a head-start 
thanks to the pre-wash detergent getting rid of at least some fats and oils already. And in case you’re thinking this is some lost art,
my much newer dishwasher - a model still on sale - works the same way. The lid of the dispenser has a divot labeled pre-wash,
and if ya put a little detergent there, it cleans much better. Detergent pods and tablets, while they are a convenient concept, break this pattern. And especially if you have an older dishwasher which wasn’t born
in the time of pre-dosed detergent dominance, those products can, frankly, suck. Now, I know many of you out there
are having a fine experience using those products and by all means you should keep using ‘em if you’re happy. But if you’re not happy with your dishwasher, or you’re a value-obsessed Midwesterner like I am, here’s Tip Number 4: try a more basic detergent product
and place some in both spots your machine expects it to go. If your dishwasher doesn’t have 
a dedicated spot to put pre-wash detergent, just add a little extra along the door or directly into the wash tub. Something like a tablespoon will be fine. And if you’re skeptical that this will actually do anything, well your dishwasher still has that dispenser, right? It’s still holding the detergent back until the second fill, 
otherwise the dispenser would be pointless. So give it a try. It can’t hurt. Speaking of giving things a try,
there’s a brand of detergent which has come out with yet another new product this time touting CycleSync™ technology: Right Ingredient ‡ ASTERISK right time! What does that mean? [clears throat] “Finish® Ultimate is our first ever tablet with
CycleSync™ technology that releases the right ingredient ‡ ASTERISK to act at the right time.” That sure implies that these will align their vibes with my machine or something. But is there anything to that implication? First, let’s put one of these tablets in my dishwasher and let it run for a bit. Yeah, it all dissolved in a matter of minutes so if I didn’t put this in the dispenser (which the instructions explicitly tell me to do) all of it would have drained out after 10 minutes. So it doesn’t appear to be anything to do
with these three sections of seemingly different items. They’re just making this prettier. Since my dishwasher doesn’t have a hole in its side, I’ll pour hot water from the tap into this glass pan
so we can see watch how the tablets dissolve. Yeah it’s just… it’s just all oozing out once the membrane is breached. I should note I tried this last time with their compressed tablet things
and I had the same thing happen - it completely dissolved in my dishwasher after 10 minutes. So what do they even mean by CycleSync? Let’s find where that asterisk leads. Oh and by the way this is actually called a double dagger
and not an asterisk, fun pedantic typography fact. It’s on the bottom - of course it is. Enzyme. That’s it? The word Enzyme? The protease and amylase enzymes that are also found
in this Walmart brand powder? The Enzymes that work best at high temperatures
so will indeed get more effective at “the right time?” I don’t know if you see how sneaky it is to put that mark 
after the word “ingredient” but hopefully you do. The thing is, if it’s not clear already, these are just tablets of soap dressed up to seem important. Your dishwasher is the thing doing the work,
and there’s nothing all that special about these. And not to get too tin foil hat on you, 
but it does feel weird to me that there’s so much differentiation for a commodity product like dishwasher detergent. Powders and gels tend to live a sad life on the bottom shelf 
while the flashy pods get all the attention, but I sincerely think these are the better products
because they jibe with the way dishwashers actually work - and they’re a better value, to boot. I much prefer powder because it comes 
in a paper box and not a plastic jug, but gels are much more readily available. However, powder products can contain both bleach and enzymes which aren’t stable together in a liquid, so powders are usually more effective. If you can find them. However - there’s a wrinkle. But it’s double-edged. One of the reasons I like powder and gel is because
how much detergent you actually need to use varies. If you have soft water, you likely need to use very little
and you can stretch a box like this for months. But if you have hard water, you’ll need to use more. Also, how soiled your dishes are affects things, too, because the detergent gets “used up” and
becomes less effective as it tackles food deposits. I strongly believe that the two-dose structure of traditional 
dishwasher programs means you can use much less detergent: you’re not expecting the detergent to do
everything with a single fill of wash water. But the tabs and packs are, though, 
so they're extremely concentrated to get all the work done at once. The wrinkle in dosing it yourself, though,
is that it’s pretty easy to use too much detergent. The cups in the dispenser are big for those of you who have 
really hard water and need a lot of detergent,   but most people don’t. So if you’re trying out a powder or gel product and find
you’re left with a powdery residue on your stuff, you’re using too much detergent and the final rinse couldn’t get rid of it all. The boxes don’t explain that - they say to
fill the cups completely which is almost always a terrible idea. You’d be surprised how little you actually need. I really appreciate being able to fiddle with this (and I’ve discovered I only need to fill the cup up
about half-way pretty much no matter what I’m cleaning) but your brain may vary. Detergent packs force a one-size-fits-all 
amount of detergent on you which very much rubs me the wrong way, but it usually works and there are many people who would prefer that. Those four tips: look for filters and clean them, run the kitchen tap until the water's hot before you start the machine, use the detergent dispenser and close the lid, and finally consider using a basic detergent product 
and add a little pre-wash detergent, are what I consider the most important things to try. I have used some astoundingly cheap dishwashers in my time 
including the gnarliest landlord special I’ve ever encountered - that thing didn’t even have a sprayer for its top rack, and boy was it loud. But it cleaned everything just fine and with Walmart brand detergent! The only thing I can attribute my seemingly perfect dishwasher scorecard to
is actually putting detergent in both places all those machines expected it to go and always running the kitchen tap until it's hot before I started the cycle. Now we've blown past the 20 minute mark 
and this video is supposed to be more shareable than the others so I’ll finish up with a lightning round of other tips you might try. If none of what I’ve gone over seems to be helping,
try a dishwasher cleaning product before you give up. Limescale and other forms of buildup can clog the sprayer nozzles
or make the pump less effective, and many products are available which help to get rid of those deposits. I’m partial to products like this which come in a bottle: you insert them upside-down and a wax plug holds the product back
until the water is hot enough to melt it. When I use these, I actually don’t run the water hot first
to make sure the plug doesn’t melt during the pre-wash, and I use the machine’s tough setting with the high-temp wash option selected. I’ve used both this Glisten product and
Finish’s version of a similar thing and find them to be great. Note the Finish product has a heavy perfume which lingers through several washes.
I like that but it may bother others so be aware of that. You can also use a product like Lemishine which is just powdered citric acid. If a deep cleaning of your dishwasher still doesn’t fix things, your dishwasher likely has a worn out pump impeller or something else is mechanically wrong, or, you may have the rare actually-bad dishwasher model,
and might just have to replace it. If your dishwasher’s detergent dispenser is broken 
and that’s why you aren’t using it, first - you might try your hand at replacing it if you feel up to it. Replacement parts are often available, and this is YouTube! I’m sure there are many guides out there, possibly for your specific dishwasher. Though I won’t be endorsing any of them. But even without a functional dispenser,
your dishwasher may be able to work with a different cycle. Express or Eco cycles often don’t do a pre-wash fill and open the dispenser right away. Those are typically options for a faster wash
with the trade-off of reduced effectiveness. I don’t know what dishwasher you have, but you can listen out for it draining
and determine how long it spends with each fill. If some cycles begin with it spending 30 or 40 minutes with the same water,
those will be what you want. But if your dispenser works, the normal cycle (or Auto cycle)
is probably what you want to use day to day. Speaking of cycles, though,
you shouldn’t be afraid to try the other cycles and options available to you. The tough settings don’t make the washing action stronger,
they just make it go on longer and might get the water hotter. So give it a try. If you have a high-temperature wash option that might be good to try, too, though I will say that in my experience using it
can exacerbate hard water deposits in some situations. Same goes with the sanitize option - I really only use that
if there’s something in the dishwasher that I feel might need it. Next - rinse aids. Use them. This isn’t a scam, and most dishwashers have a rinse aid dispenser
right next to the detergent dispenser. It’ll squirt a little bit of this stuff out in the final rinse, and all that it is is a very mild surfactant which reduces the surface tension of water,
causing it to form a thin film which easily evaporates without leaving water spots. This is particularly helpful to use if you have hard water,
and many machines allow you to vary how much rinse aid it dispenses - you’ll need more the harder your water is. This stuff is so simple there’s no need to go name-brand. Just get the cheap stuff. And, to European viewers, many of your dishwashers
have built-in water softeners and require dishwasher salt. So make sure ya got that on hand and fill it up if you need to. If you aren’t able to find powders or gels in your area,
or they pose a challenge for you to use for whatever reason, I would recommend trying the cheapest
store-brand dishwasher tablets or pods you can find. You may very well find they work great! And if they don’t, try mimicking what you can do with powder and gel 
by putting one in the dispenser and another directly into the tub. Pods are quite concentrated so that runs the risk of it leaving a residue,
but it’s something to try if your dishwasher isn’t that great. I honestly wish detergent people would make a two-section pod
with a removable baby pod for use in the pre-wash. I probably still wouldn’t use that because I find powder in a box
with a spout to be plenty convenient already, but that feels like a useful option. Oh, and in case you might find using this box difficult,
you might try emptying it into a storage container you can use a scoop with. That might also help if you live somewhere very 
damp and powder will cake up on you (but, not for nothing, I never have that problem here in 
the Midwest and I keep this under the sink). And lastly, I didn’t really want to go here 
because it’s the source of strife for many a family, but make sure you’re loading the dishes correctly. The sprayers are below the racks
so the dirty surfaces should be facing down. Additionally, since the sprayers rotate around the center of the machine,
the dirty surfaces of vertical objects like plates should ideally face inward. When I’m loading it, the left-hand side looks like this,
and right of the center-line it looks like that. Also be sure things aren’t bunching together and 
blocking their neighbors from being hit by the sprayers, and - this is important - make sure those sprayer arms can spin freely. Tall items in the bottom rack can stop the top rack’s sprayer from spinning, and that’s not good. A whole lot of stuff will get hardly any water
if it stays in one place throughout the cycle. The top rack is often adjustable
and can be raised up to minimize this so if stuff on the top rack is often dirty for you, give that a try. And be mindful that on either rack,
there’s less washing action at the corners because it’s a square on top of a circle, so if you’re washing something that’s really dirty, 
you’ll want to keep it closer to the center. And I think that’s it. I want to reiterate that if you’re not having problems with your dishwasher, you don’t have to change your habits
(though you're probably not watching this). But, gosh, I’d really like more people to just buy plain powder 
because it feels like this is an endangered species. My local Walmart keeps just a single slot of shelf space
for this stuff and they’re often out. I'm to the point of checking for it every time I stop in
for whatever random thing brings me to Walmart. And while I don’t want to say pods don’t work (clearly they do for many people)
the feedback from the last videos was amazing. Many people reported that their dishwashers were cleaning like never before
and all thanks to trying cheap detergent and using it as their machine expects. I’m reasonably sure you’ll see many comments like that below this video. Your dishwasher is responsible for 99% of the work. Detergents are necessary, of course, but it’s just soap. And I for one think that luxury soap products which go into a machine and
don’t deliver any kind of unique experience but perhaps a vague hint of fragrance… are silly. Thanks for watching, and here’s to clean dishes!"

story about what's next something incomprehensible tomorrow IBM will announce and advance in an entirely new kind of computing one that may solve problems in minutes that would take today's supercomputers millions of years that's the difference in Quantum Computing a technology being developed at IBM Google and others it's named for quantum physics which describes the forces of the subatomic realm the science is deep and we can't scratch the surface but we hope to explain enough so that you won't be blinds Ed by a breakthrough that could transform civilization the quantum computer pushes the limits of knowledge new science new engineering all leading to this processor that computes with the atomic forces that created the universe I think this moment it feels to us like the Pioneers on the 1940s and 50s that were building the first digital computer computers Dario Gill is something of a Quantum Crusader Spanish born with a PhD in electrical engineering Gil is head of research at IBM how much faster is this than say the world's best super computer today we are now in a stage where we can do certain calculations with these systems that would take the biggest supercomputers in the world to be able to do some similar calculation but the beauty of it is that we see that we're going to continue to expand that capability such that not even a million or a billion of those supercomputers connected together could do the calculations of these future machines so we've come a long way and the most exciting part is that we have a road map and a journey right now where that is going to continue to increase at a r that is going to be shocking I'm not sure the world is prepared for this change definitely not to understand the change go back to 1947 and the invention of a switch called a transistor the transistor a new name computers have processed information on transistors ever since getting faster as more transistors were squeezed onto a chip billions of them today but it takes that many because each transistor holds information in only two states it's either on or it's off like a coin heads or tails Quantum abandons transistors and encodes information on electrons that behave like this coin we created with animation electrons behave in a way so that they are heads and tails and everything in between you've gone from hand in one bit of information at a time on a transistor to exponentially more data you can see that there is fantastic amount of information stored when you can look at all possible angles not just up or down physicist miio Kaku of the City University of New York already calls today's computers classical he uses a maze to explain quantum's difference let's look at a classical computer calculating how a mouse navigates a maze it is painful one by one it has to map every single left turn right turn left turn right turn before it finds the goal now a quantum computer scans all possible routes simultaneously this is amazing how many turns are there hundreds of possible turns right quantum computers do it all at once kaku's book titled Quantum Supremacy explains the stakes we're looking at a race a race between China between IBM Google Microsoft Honeywell all the big boys are in this race to create a workable operationally efficient quantum computer because the nation or company that does this will rule the world economy but a reliable general purpose quantum computer is a tough CL time yet maybe that's why this wall is in the lobby of Google's Quantum lab in California here we got an inside look starting with a microscope's view of what replaces the transistor this right here is one cubit and this is another Cubit this is a 5 Cubit chain those crosses at the bottom are cubits short for Quantum bits they hold the electrons and act like AR IAL atoms unlike transistors each additional Cubit doubles the computer's power it's exponential so while 20 transistors are 20 times more powerful than one 20 cubits are a million times more powerful than one so this gets positioned right here on the fridge and this Karina Chow Chief Operating Officer of Google's lab showed us the processor that holds the cubits much of that above chills the cubits to what physicists call near absolute zero near absolute zero I understand is about 460° below 0 fah so that's about as cold as anything can get yes almost as cold as possible that temperature inside a sealed computer is one of the coldest places in the universe the Deep Freeze eliminates electrical resistance and isolates the cubits from outside vibrations so they can be controlled with an electromagnetic field the cubits must vibrate in unison but that's a tough trick called coherence once you've achieved coherence of the cubits how easy is that to maintain it's really hard um coherence is very challenging coherence is fleeting in all similar machines coherence breaks down constantly creating errors we're making about one error in every hundred or so steps ultimately we think we're going to need about one error in every million or so steps that would probably be identified as one of the biggest barriers mitigating those errors and extending coherence time while scaling up to larger machines are the challenges facing German American scientist hartmut Nevan who founded Google's lab and its casual style in 2012 can the problems that are in the way of quantum Computing be solved I should confess my subtitle here is Chief optimist so after having say this I would say at this point we don't need any more fundamental breakthroughs we need little improvements here and there we have all the pieces together we just need to integrate them well to build larger and larger systems and you think that all of this will be integrated into a system in what period of time yeah we often say we want to do it by the end of the decade so that we can use this Kennedy quote and get it done by the end of the decade the end of this decade yes five or six years yes this that's about the timeline Dario Gil predicts and the IBM research director told us something surprising there are problems that classical computers can never solve can never solve and I think this is an important point because we're accustomed to saying ah computers get better actually there are many many problems that are so complex that we can make that statement that actually classical computers will never be able to solve that problem not now not a 100 years from now not a thousand years from now you actually require a different way to represent information and process information that's what Quantum gives you there's not Quantum could give us answers to Impossible problems in physics chemistry engineering and Medicine which is why IBM and Cleveland Clinic have installed one of the first quantum computers to leave the lab for the real world takes time it takes way too much time to find the solutions we need right now we sat down with dorio Gil and Dr sill SRO Chief research officer at Cleveland Clinic she told us healthc care would be transformed if quantum computers can model the behavior of proteins the molecules that regulate all life proteins change shape to change function in ways too complex to follow and when they get it wrong that causes disease it takes on many shapes many many shapes depending upon what it's doing and where it is and which other protein it's with I need to understand the shape it's in when it's doing an interaction or a function that I don't want it to do for that patient cancer autoimmunity it's a problem we are limited completely by the computational ability to look at the structure in real time for any even one molecule Cleveland Clinic is so proud of its quantum computer they set it up in a Lobby behind the glass that shiny silver cylinder encloses the kind of cooling system and processor you saw earlier Quantum is not solving the protein problem yet this is more of a trial run to introduce researchers to quantum's potential the people using this machine are they having to learn an entirely different way to communicate with a computer I think that's what's really nice that you actually just use a regular laptop and you write a program uh very much like you would write a traditional program but when you you know click you know go and run it just happens to run on a very different kind of computer there are a half dozen competing designs in the race China named Quantum a top National priority and the US government is spending nearly a billion dollars a year on research the first change comes next year when the US publishes new standards for encryption because Quantum is expected one day to break the codes that lock everything from National secrets to credit cards tomorrow IBM will unveil its Quantum system 2 with three times the cubits as the machine you saw in Cleveland this past August we saw a system 2 Under Construction it's a machine unlike anything we've ever built and this is this is it this is it IBM's Dario Gill told us system 2 has the room to expand to thousands of cubits what are the chances that this is one of those things that's going to be ready in 5 years and always will be we don't see an obstacle right now that will prevent us from Building Systems that will have tens of thousands and even 100,000 cubits working with each other so we are highly confident that we will get there the language of all the amazing things we heard it was physicist miio Kaku who led us down the path to the biggest idea of all he said we were walking through a quantum computer processing information with subatomic particles is how the universe works you know when I look at the night sky I See Stars I look at the flowers the trees I realized that it's all Quantum the Splendor of the universe itself the language of the universe is the language of the quantum learning that language may bring more than inconceivable speed reverse engineering Nature's computer could be a window on creation itself last month the nearest star to the Earth was in California in a labor labatory for the first time the world's largest lasers forced atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in the same kind of energy producing reaction that fires the sun it lasted less than a billionth of a second but after six Decades of toil and failure the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory proved it could be done if Fusion becomes commercial power one day it would be endless and carbon free in other words it would change human Destiny as you'll see there's far to go but after December's breakthrough we were invited to tour the lab and meet the team that brought star power down to earth uncontrolled Fusion is easy mastered so long ago the films are in Black and White Fusion is what a hydrogen bomb does releasing energy by forcing atoms of hydrogen to fuse together what's been impossible is harnessing the fires of Armageddon into something useful the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory helps maintain nuclear weapons and experiments with high energy physics an hour east of San Francisco we met livermore's director Kim budell in the lab that made history the national ignition facility the national ignition facility is the world's largest most energetic laser it was built starting in the 1990s to create conditions in the laboratory that had previously only been accessible in the most extreme objects in the universe like the center of giant planets or the Sun or in operating nuclear weapons and the goal was to really be able to study that kind of very high energy high density condition in a lot of detail the national ignition facility or n was built for $3.5 billion to ignite self-sustaining Fusion they tried nearly 200 times over 13 years but like a car with a weak battery the atomic engine would never turn over nif drew some nicknames it did uh for many years the not ignition facility the never ignition facility uh more recently than nearly ignition facility so uh this recent has really put the ignition in the ni ignition means igniting a fusion reaction that puts out more energy than the lasers put in so if you can get it hot enough dense enough fast enough and hold it together long enough the fusion reactions start to self- sustain and that's really what happened here on December 5th main laser operation will begin in approximately one minute last month the laser shot fired from this control room put two units of energy into the experiment Adams began fusing and about three units of energy came out Tammy ma who leads the lab's laser Fusion research initiatives got the call while waiting for a plane and I burst into tears it was just tears of joy and I actually physically started shaking and and jumping up and down in in you know at the gate before everybody bored so everybody was like what is that crazy woman doing Tammy ma is crazy about engineering and that's another one of our sensors for she showed us why the problem of fusion would bring anyone to Tears first there's the energy required which is delivered by lasers in these tubes that are longer than a football field and how many are there altogether 192 total lasers each one of these lasers is one of the most energetic in the world and you have 192 of them that's pretty cool right well pretty hot actually millions of degrees which is why they use keys to lock up the lasers Shot director ready the beams strike with a power 1,000 times greater than the entire National power grid 3 2 1 shot your lights don't go out at home when they take a shot because these capacitors store the electricity in the tubes the laser beams amplify by racing back and forth and the Flash is a fraction of a second we have to get to these incredible conditions hotter denser than the center of the Sun and so we need all of that laser energy to get to these very high energy densities all that wallup vaporizes a Target nearly too small to see can I hold this thing absolutely let it go there we go unbelievable absolutely amazing Michael Stater man's team builds the hollow Target shells that are loaded with hydrogen at 430° below zero the Precision that we need for making these shells is Extreme the shells are almost perfectly round uh they have a roughness that is 100 times better than a mirror you think about that if it wasn't smoother than a mirror imperfections would make the implosion of atoms uneven causing a fusion fizzle so these need to be as close to perfect as humanly possible that's right this way and we do think there are among the most perfect items that we have on Earth stator's lab pursues Perfection by vaporizing carbon and forming the shell out of diamond they build, 1500 a year to make 150 nearly perfect all the components are brought together under the microscope itself and then the assembler uses electromechanical stages to put the parts where they're supposed to go uh move them together and then we apply glue using a hair a hair yeah usually something like an eyelash or similar or a cat whisker you apply glue with a cat whisker this way why does it have to be so small the laser gives us only a finite amount of energy and um to drive a bigger capsule we would need more energy so it's a constrain of the facility that you've seen that is very large and despite its big size this is about what we can drive with it the target could be larger but then the laser would have to be larger well on December 5th they used a thicker Target so it would hold its shape longer and they figured out how to boost the power of the laser shot without damaging the lasers so this is an example of a Target before the shot Tammy ma showed us an intact Target assembly that diamond shell you saw is inside that silver colored cylinder this assembly goes into a blue vacuum chamber three stories tall it's hard to see here because it's bristling with lasers and instruments this instrument they called Dante because they told us it measures the fires of Hell one physicist said you should see the target we blasted December 5th which made us ask could we have you seen this before this is the first time I'm seeing it for tamy Ma and for the world this is the first look at what's left of the target assembly That Changed History and our effect like Bell's first phone or Edison's light bulb this thing is going to end up in the Smithsonian the target cylinder was blasted to Oblivion the Copper support that held it was peeled backward the explosion on the end of this was hotter than the sun it was hotter than the center of the sun we were able to achieve temperatures that were the hottest in the entire solar system which would make an astronomical change in electric power unlike today's nuclear plants which split atoms apart fusing them is many times more powerful with little long-term radiation and it's easy to turn off so no meltdowns but getting from the first ignition to a power plant will be hard how many shots do you take in a day we take on average uh a little more than one shot per date if this was theoretically a commercial power plant how many shots a day would be required approximately 10 shots per second would be required and the other big challenge of course is not just increasing the repetition rate but also getting the gain out of the targets to go up to about a factor of a 100 Not only would the reactions have to produce 100 times more energy but a power plant would need 9 100,000 perfect diamond shells a day also the lasers would have to be much more efficient remember December's breakthrough put two units of energy in and got three out well it took 300 units of power to fire the lasers by that standard it was 300 in three out that detail was not front and center at the department of energy December news conference which fused the advance with an unlikely timeline today's announcement is a huge step forward uh to the president's goal of achieve achieving commercial Fusion within a decade when you heard that President Biden's goal was commercial fusion power in a decade you thought what I thought it was nonsense Charles cyth is a trained mathematician science author and professor at New York University who wrote a 2008 book on the hyping of fusion power I don't want to diminish the fact that this is a real achievement um ignition is a milestone that people have been trying for to do for years I'm afraid that there's so many technical hurdles even after this great achievement uh that 10 years is a pipe dream those hurdles cyth says include scaling up livermore's achievement the simber shot generated about enough Excess power to boil two pots of coffee the hurdles might be overcome cyth says but not soon I have a running bet going that uh we're not going to have it by 2050 still betting against Charles Cy's prophecy are more than 30 private companies designing various approaches to fusion power including using magnets not lasers $3 billion in private money flowed into those companies in the last 13 months including bets by Bill Gates and Google amid all this speculation Lawrence livermore's director Kim Buell is certain of one thing can you do it again absolutely they're going to try again next month Buell agrees the obstacles are enormous but she told us commercial fusion power could be demonstr ated in 20 years or so with enough funding and dedication we likened the first ignition to the first wri Brothers flight which covered only 120 ft it's one thing to believe uh that the science is possible uh that the conditions can be created uh it's another to see it in action and it really is a remarkable feeling after working for 60 years to get to this point um to have first taken that first flight flight it was 44 years from a puddle jump to supersonic flight whether fusion power is 10 or 50 years away is now mainly an engineering problem Lawrence Livermore has proven that from a machine A Star is Born whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it you have Jeffrey Hinton to thank Hinton has been called The Godfather of AI a British computer scientist whose controversial ideas help make advanced artificial intelligence possible and so change the world Hinton believes that AI will do enormous good good but tonight he has a warning he says that AI systems may be more intelligent than we know and there's a chance the machines could take over which made us ask the question does Humanity know what it's doing no um I think we're moving into a period when for the first time ever we may have things more intelligent than us you believe they can understand yes you believe they are intelligent yes you believe these systems have experiences of their own and can make decisions based on those experiences in the same sense as people do yes are they conscious I think they probably don't have much self-awareness at present so in that sense I don't think they're conscious will they have self-awareness Consciousness I oh yes I think they will in time and so human beings will be the second most intelligent beings on the planet yeah Jeffrey Hinton told us the artificial intelligence he set in motion was an accident born of a failure in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh he dreamed of simulating a neural network on a computer simply as a tool for what he was really studying the human brain but back back then almost no one thought software could mimic the brain his PhD advisor told him to drop it before it ruined his career Hinton says he failed to figure out the human mind but the long Pursuit led to an artificial version it took much much longer than I expected it took like 50 years before it worked well but in the end it did work well at what point did you realize that you were right about neural networks and most everyone else was wrong I always thought I was right in 2019 Hinton and collaborators Yan laon on the left and yosua Beno won the touring award the Nobel Prize of computing to understand how their work on artificial neural networks helped machines learn to learn let us take you to a game look at that oh my goodness this is Google's AI lab in London which we first showed you this past April Jeffrey Hinton wasn't involved in this soccer project but these robots are a great example of machine learning the thing to understand is that the robots were not programmed to play soccer they were told to score they had to learn how on their own oh go in general here's how AI does it Henton and his collaborators created software in layers with each layer handling part of the problem that's the so-called neural network but this is the key when for example the robot scores a message is sent back down through all of the layers that says that pathway was right likewise when an answer is wrong that message goes down through the network so correct connections get stronger wrong connections get weaker and by trial and error the machine teaches itself you think these AI systems are better at learning than the human mind I think they may be yes and at present they're quite a lot smaller so even the biggest chatbots only have about a trillion Connections in them the human brain has about 100 trillion and yet in the trillion Connections in a chatbot it knows far more than you do in your 100 trillion connections which suggests it's got a much better way of getting knowledge into those connections a much better way of getting knowledge that isn't fully understood we have a very good idea of sort of roughly what it's doing but as soon as it gets really complicated we don't actually know what's going on anymore than we know what's going on in your brain what do you mean we don't know exactly how it works it was designed designed by people no it wasn't what we did was we designed the learning algorithm that's a bit like designing the principle of evolution but when this learning algorithm then interacts with data it produces complicated neural networks that are good at doing things but we don't really understand exactly how they do those things what are the implications of these systems autonomously writing their own computer code and executing their own computer code that a serious worry right so one of the ways in which these systems might Escape control is by writing their own computer code to modify themselves and that's something we need to seriously worry about what do you say to someone who might argue if the systems become benevolent just turn them off they will be able to manipulate people right and these will be very good at convincing people because they'll have learned from all the novels that were ever written written all the books by makavelli all the political connives they'll know all that stuff they'll know how to do it noow of the human kind runs in Jeffrey hinton's family his ancestors include mathematician George buou who invented the basis of computing and George Everest who surveyed India and got that mountain named after him but as a boy Hinton himself could never climb the peak of expectations raised by a domineering father every morning when I went to school he'd actually say to me as I walk down the driveway get in there pitching and maybe when you're twice as old as me you'll be half as good dad was an authority on Beatles he knew a lot more about beatles than he knew about people did you feel that as a child a bit yes when he died we went to his study at the University and the walls were lined with boxes of papers on different kinds of beetle and just near the door there was a slightly smaller box that simply said not insects and that's where he had all the things about the family today at 75 Hinton recently retired after what he calls 10 happy years at Google now he's professor ameritus at the University of Toronto and he happened to mention he had has more academic citations than his father some of his research led to chatbots like Google's Bard which we met last spring confounding absolutely confounding we asked Bard to write a story from six words for sale baby shoes never worn holy cow the shoes were a gift from my wife but we never had a baby Bard created a deeply human tale of a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger who accepted the shoes to heal the pain after her miscarriage I am rarely speechless I don't know what to make of this chatbots are said to be language models that just predict the next most likely word based on probability you'll hear people saying things like they're just doing autocomplete they're just trying to predict the next word and they're just using statistics well it's true they're just trying to predict the next word but if you think about it to predict the next word you have to understand the sentences so the idea they're just predicting the next words so they're not intelligent is crazy you have to be really intelligent to predict the next word really accurately to prove it Hinton showed us a test he devised for chat gp4 the chatbot from a company called open AI it was sort of reassuring to see a turing Award winner mistype and blame the computer oh damn this thing we're going to go back and start again that's okay hinton's test was a riddle about house painting an answer would demand reasoning and planning this is what he typed into chat gp4 the rooms in my house are painted white or blue or yellow and yellow paint Fades to White within a year in two years time I'd like all the rooms to be white what should I do the answer began in one second gp4 advised the rooms painted in blue need to be repainted the rooms painted in yellow don't need to be repainted because they would Fade to White before the deadline and oh I didn't even think of that it warned if you paint the yellow rooms white there's a risk the color might be off when the yellow Fades besides it advised you'd be wasting resources painting rooms that were going to Fade to White anyway you believe that chat GPD 4 understands I believe it definitely understands yes and in 5 years time I think in 5 years time it may well be able to reason better than us reasoning that he says is leading to ai's Great risks and great benefits so an obvious area where there's huge benefits is Healthcare AI is already comparable with Radiologists at understanding what's going on in medical images it's going to be very good at designing drugs it already is designing drugs so that's an area where it's almost entirely going to do good I like that area the risks are what well the risks are having a whole class of people who are unemployed and not valued much because what they what they used to do is now done by machines other immediate risks he worries about include fake news unintended bias in employment and policing and autonomous Battlefield robots what is a path forward that ensures safety I don't know I I can't see a path that guarantees safety that we're entering a period of great uncertainty where we're dealing with things we've never dealt with before and normally the first time you deal with something totally novel you get it wrong and we can't afford to get it wrong with these things can't afford to get it wrong why well because they might take over take over from Humanity yes that's a possibility why would they I'm not saying it will happen if we could stop them ever wanting to that would be great but it's not clear we can stop them ever wanting to Jeffrey told us he has no regrets because of ai's potential for good but he says now is the moment to run experiments to understand AI for governments to impose regulations and for a world treaty to ban the use of military robots he reminded us of Robert Oppenheimer who after inventing the atomic bomb campaigned against the hydrogen bomb a man who changed the world and found the world Beyond his control it maybe we look back and see this as a kind of Turning Point when Humanity had to make the decision about whether to develop these things further and what to do to protect themselves if they did um I don't know I think my main message is there's enormous uncertainty about what's going to happen next these things do understand and because they understand we need to think hard about what's going to happen next and we just don't know we may look on our time as the moment civilization was transformed as it was by fire Agriculture and electricity in 2023 we learned that a machine taught itself how to speak to humans like a peer with which is to say with creativity truth errors and lies the technology known as a chatbot is only one of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence machines that can teach themselves superhuman skills in April we explored what's coming next at Google a leader in this new world CEO Sundar Pai told us AI will be as good or as evil as human nature allows the revolution he says is coming faster than you know do you think Society is prepared for what's coming you know there are two ways I think about it on one hand I feel no uh because you know the pace at which we can think and adapt as societal institutions compared to the PACE at which the technology is evolving there seems to be a mismatch on the other hand compared to any other technology I've seen more people worried about it earlier in its life cycle so I feel optimistic the number of people you know who have started worrying about the implications and hence the conversations are starting in a serious way as well I guess our conversations with 50-year-old Sundar Pai started at Google's new campus in Mountain View California it runs on 40% solar power and collects more water than it uses Hightech that Pai couldn't have imagined growing up in India with no telephone at home we were on a waiting list to get a rotary phone and for about 5 years and it finally came home I can still recall it vividly it changed our lives to me it was the first moment I understood the power of what getting access to technology meant so probably led me to be doing what I'm doing today what he's doing since 2019 is leading both both Google and its parent company alphabet valued at $1.5 trillion worldwide Google runs 90% of internet searches and 70% of smartphones we're really excited about but it's dominance was attacked this past February when Microsoft linked its search engine to a chatbot in a race for AI dominance in March Google released its chatbot named bard it's really here to help you brainstorm ideas to generate content like a speech or a blog post or an email we were introduced to Bard by Google vice president sha and Senior Vice President James manika here's Bard the first thing we learned was that Bard does not look for answers on the internet like Google search does so I wanted to get inspiration from some of the best speeches in the World Bard's replies come from a self-contained program that was mostly self-taught our experience was unsettling confounding absolutely confounding Bard appeared to possess the sum of human knowledge with microchips more than 100,000 times faster than the human brain summarize the we asked Bard to summarize the New Testament it did in 5 seconds and 17 words in Latin we asked for it in Latin that took another 4 seconds then we played with a famous six-word short story often attributed to Hemingway for sale baby shoes never worn wow the only prompt we gave was finish this story in 5 seconds holy cow the shoes were a gift from my wife but we never had a baby they were from The six-word Prompt Bard created a deeply human tale with characters it invented including a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger grieving after a miscarriage and longing for closure uh I am rarely speechless I don't know what to make of this give me we asked for the story in verse in 5 seconds there was a poem written by a machine with breathtaking insight into the mystery of Faith Bard wrote she knew her baby Soul would always be alive the humanity at superhuman speed was a shock how was this possible so James manika told us that over several months Bard read most everything on the internet internet and created a model of what language looks like rather than search its answers come from this language model so for example if I said to you Scott peanut butter and jelly right so it tries and learns to predict okay so peanut butter usually is followed by jelly it tries to predict the most probable next words based on everything it's learned uh so it's not going out to find stuff it's just predicting the next word but it doesn't feel like that we asked Bard why it helps people and it replied quote because it makes me happy Bard to my eye appears to be thinking appears to be making judgments that's not what's happening these machines are not sensient they are not aware of themselves they're not sensient they're not aware themselves uh they can exhibit behaviors that look like that because keep in mind they've learned from us we are sentient beings we have beings that have feelings emotions ideas thoughts perspectives we've reflected all that in books in novels in fiction so when they learn from that they build patterns from that so it's no surprise to me that the exhibited behavior sometimes looks like maybe there's somebody behind there there's nobody there there these are not sensient beings they not Zimbabwe born Oxford educated James manika holds a new position at Google his job is to think about how Ai and Humanity will best coexist AI has a potential to change many ways in which we've thought about Society about what we're able to do the the problems we can solve but AI itself will pose its own problems could Heming way WR a better short story maybe but Bard can write a million before Hemingway could finish one imagine that level of automation across the economy a lot of people can be replaced by this technology yes there are some job occupations that will start to decline over time there are also new job categories that will grow over time but the biggest change will be the jobs that will be changed something like more than 2third will have their definitions change not go away but change because they're now being assisted by Ai and by automation so this is a profound change which has implications for skills how do we assist people build new skills learn to work alongside machines and how do these complement what people do today this is going to impact every product across every company and and so that's why I think it's a a very very profound technology and so we are just in early days every product in every company that's right AI will impact everything so for example you could be a radiologist you know if I if you think about 5 to 10 years from now you're going to have a AI collaborator with you it may triage you come in the morning you let's say you have 100 things to go through it may say these are the most serious cases you need to look at first or when you're looking at something it may pop up and say you may have missed something important why wouldn't we you know why would we take advantage of a superpowered assistant to help you across everything you do you maybe a student trying to learn math or history and you know you will have something helping you there are we ask Pai what jobs would be disrupted he said knowledge workers people like writers accountants Architects and ironically software Engineers AI writes computer code too today sundarai walks a narrow line a few employees have quit some believing that Google's AI rollout is too slow others too fast there are some serious flaws there's a return of inflation James manika asked Bard about inflation it wrote an instant essay in economics and recommended five books but days later we checked none of the books is real B fabricated the titles this very human trait error with confidence is called in the industry hallucination are you getting a lot of hallucinations uh yes uh you know which is expected no one in the in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems all models uh do have uh this as an issue is it a solvable problem it's a matter of intense debate I think we'll make progress to help cure hallucinations Bard features a Google it button that leads to oldfashioned search Google has also built safety filters in debard to screen for things like hate speech and bias how great a risk is the spread of disinformation AI will challenge that in a deeper way the scale of this problem is going to be much bigger bigger problems he says with fake news and fake images it will be possible with AI to create uh you know a video easily where it could be Scott saying something or me saying something and we never said that and it could look accurate but you know at a societal scale you know can cause a lot of harm is Bard safe for society the way we have launched it today uh as an experiment in a limited way uh I think so but we all have to be responsible in each step along the way this past spring Google released an advanced version of Bard that can write software and connect to the internet Google says it's developing even more sophisticated AI models you are letting this out slowly so that Society can get used to it that's one part of it uh one part is also so that we get the user feedback and we can develop more robust safety layers before we build before we deploy more capable models interacting with of the AI issues we talked about the most mysterious is called emergent properties some AI systems are teaching themselves skills they weren't expected to have how this happens is not well understood for example one Google AI program adapted on its own after it was prompted in the language of Bangladesh which it was not trained to translate we discovered that with very few amounts of prompting in Bengali he can now translate all of Bengali so now all of a sudden we now have a research effort where we're now trying to get to a thousand languages there is an aspect of this which we call all of us in the field call it as a black box you know you don't fully understand and you can't quite tell why it said this or why it got wrong we have some ideas and our ability to understand this gets better over time but that's where the State ofthe art is you don't fully understand how it works and yet you've turned it loose on society let me put it this way I don't think we fully understand how a human mind works either was it from that black box we wondered that Bard Drew its short story that seems so disarming human it talked about the pain that humans feel it talked about Redemption how did it do all of those things if it's just trying to figure out what the next right word is me I've had these experiences uh talking with b as well there are two views of this you know there are a set of people who view this as look these are just algorithms they're just repeating what it's seen online then there is the view where these algorithms are showing emergent properties to be creative to reason to plan and so on right and and personally I think we need to be uh we need to approach this with humility part of the reason I think it's good that some of these Technologies are getting out is so that Society you know people like you and others can process what's happening and we begin this conversation and debate and I think it's important to do that when we come back we'll take you inside Google's artificial intelligence Labs where robots are learning the revolution in artificial intelligence is the center of a debate ranging from those who hope it will save Humanity to those who predict Doom Google lies somewhere in the optimistic middle introducing AI in steps so that Civilization can get used to it we saw what's coming next in machine learning earlier this year at Google's AI lab in London a company called Deep Mind where the future looks something like this look at that oh my goodness they've got a pretty good kick on them can still go a good good game a soccer match at Deep Mind looks like fun in games but here's the thing humans did not program these robots to play they learned the game by themselves it's coming up with these interesting different strategies different ways to walk different ways to block and they're doing it they're scoring over and over again Mr Robot here Rya hadel vice president of research and Robotics showed us how engineers used motion capture technology to teach the AI program how to move like a human but on the soccer pitch the robots were told only that the object was to score the self-learning program spent about two weeks testing different moves it disgarded those that didn't work built on those that did and created Allstars there's another goal and with practice they get better Hansel told us that independent from the robots the AI program plays thousands of games from which it learns and invents its own tactics here you think that red player is going to grab it but instead it just stops IT hands it back passes it back and then goes for the goal and the AI figured out how to do that on its that's right that's right and it takes a while at first all the players just run after the ball together like a gaggle of you know six- year olds the first time they're they're they're playing ball over time what we start to see is now ah what's the strategy you go after the ball I'm coming around this way or we should pass or I should block while you get to the goal so we see all of that coordination um emerging in the play this is a lot of fun but what are the practical implications of what we're seeing here this is the type of research that can event eventally lead to robots that can come out of the factories and work in other types of human environments you know think about mining think about dangerous construction work um or exploration or Disaster Recovery these are R hadsel is among 1,000 humans at Deep Mind the company was co-founded just 12 years ago by CEO Deus pabus so if I think back to 2010 when we started nobody was doing there was nothing going on in Industry people used to ey roll when we talked to them investors about doing AI so we couldn't we could barely get two cents together to start off with which is crazy if you think about now the billions being invested into AI startups and Cambridge Harvard MIT hbus has degrees in computer science and Neuroscience his PhD is in human imagination and imagine this when he was 12 in his age group he was the number two chess champion in the world it was through games that he came to AI I've been working on AI for for decades now and I've always believed that it's going to be the most important invention that Humanity will ever make will the pace of change outstrip our ability to adapt I don't think so I think that we um you know we're sort of an infinitely adaptable species um you know you look at today us using all of our smartphones and other devices and we effortlessly sort of adapt to these new technologies and this is going to be another one of those changes like that among the biggest changes at Deep Mind was the discovery that self-learning machines can be creative so this is hababa showed us a game playing program that learns it's called Alpha zero and it dreamed up a winning chess strategy no human had ever seen but this is just a machine how does it achieve creativity it plays against itself tens tens of millions of times so it can explore um parts of Chess that maybe human chess players and and and programmers who program chess computers haven't thought about before it never gets tired it never gets hungry it just plays chess all the time yes it's it's kind of an amazing thing to see because actually you set off Alpha zero in the morning uh and it starts off playing randomly by lunchtime you know it's able to beat me and beat most chess players and then by the evening it's stronger than the world champion Deus saaba sold Deep Mind to Google in 2014 one reason was to get his hands on this Google has the enormous computing power that AI needs this Computing Center is in Prior Oklahoma but Google has 23 of these putting it near the top in computing power in the world this is one of two advances that make a AI ascendant now first the sum of all human knowledge is online and second Brute Force Computing that very Loosely approximates the neural networks and talents of the brain things like memory imagination planning reinforcement learning these are all things that are known about how the brain does it and we wanted to replicate some of that uh in our AI systems you predict one of those indiv those are some of the elements that led to deep mind's greatest achievement so far solving an impossible problem in biology proteins are building blocks of life but only a tiny fraction were understood because 3D mapping of just one could take years deep mine created an AI program for the protein problem and set it Loose well it took us about four or five years to to figure out how to build the system it was probably our most complex project we've ever undertaken but once we did that it can solve uh a protein structure in a matter of seconds and actually over the last year we did all the 200 million proteins that are known to science how long would it have taken using traditional methods well the rule of thumb I was always told by my biologist friends is that it it takes a whole PhD 5 years to do one protein structure experimentally so if you think 200 million times five that's a billion years of PhD time it would have taken Deep Mind Made its protein database public a gift to humanity havabus called it how has it been used it's been used in uh in enormously broad number of ways actually from U malaria vaccines to developing new enzymes that can eat plastic waste um to new uh antibiotics most AI systems today do one or maybe two things well the soccer robots for example can't write up a grocery list or book your travel or drive your car the ultimate goal is what's called artificial general intelligence a learning machine that can score on a wide range of talents would such a machine be conscious of itself so that's another great question we you know philosophers haven't really settled on a definition of Consciousness yet but if we mean by sort of self-awareness and uh these kinds of things um you know I think there is a possibility AIS one day could be I definitely don't think they are today um but I think again this is one of the fascinating scientific things we're going to find out on this journey towards AI even unconscious current AI is superhuman in narrow ways back in California we saw Google Engineers teaching skills that robots will practice continuously on their own push the blue cube to the blue triangle they comprehend instructions push the yellow hexagon to the yellow heart and learn to recognize objects what would you like how about an apple how about an apple on my way I will bring an apple to youying Vincent vanok senior director of Robotics showed us how robot 106 was trained on millions of images I am going to pick up the apple and can recognize all the items on a crowded countertop if we can give the robot A diversity of EXP experiences a lot more different objects in different settings the robot gets better at every one of them now that humans have pulled the forbidden fruit of artificial knowledge thank you we start the Genesis of a new Humanity AI can utilize all the information in the world what no human could ever hold in their head and I wonder if humanity is diminished by this enormous capability that we're developing I think the possibility of AI do not diminish uh Humanity in any way and in fact in some ways I think they actually raise us to even deeper more profound questions Google's James manika sees this moment as an inflection point history I think we're constantly adding these superpowers or capabilities to what humans can do do in a way that expands possibilities as opposed to narrow them I think so I don't think of it as diminishing humans but it does raise some really profound questions for us who are we what do we value uh what are we good at how do we relate with each other those become very very important questions that are constantly going to be in one case sense exciting but perhaps unsettling too it is an unsettling moment critics argue the rush to AI comes too fast while competitive pressure among giants like Google and startups you never heard of is propelling Humanity into the Future Ready or not but I think if I take a 10year Outlook it is so clear to me we will have some form of very capable intelligence that can do amazing things and we need to adapt as a society for it Google CEO Sundar Pai told us Society must quickly adapt with regulations for AI in the economy laws to punish abuse and treaties among nations to make AI safe for the worldy you know these are deep questions and you know we call this alignment you know one way we think about how do you develop AI systems that are aligned to human values and including uh morality this is why I think the development of this needs to include not just Engineers but social scientists ethicists philosophers and so on and I think we have to be very thoughtful and I think these are all things Society needs to figure out as we move along it's not for a company to decide we'll end with a note that had never appeared on 60 Minutes but one in the AI Revolution ution you may be hearing often the proceeding was created with 100% human content only four companies in the world are worth more than $2 trillion Microsoft Apple alphabet parent company of Google and computer chip maker Nvidia the California based company saw its stock market value soore from 1 trillion to $2 trillion in just8 months this past year fueled by the insatiable demand for its cuttingedge technology the hardware and software that make today's artificial intelligence possible we wondered how a company founded in 1993 to improve video game Graphics turned into a Titan of 21st century AI so we went to Silicon Valley to meet nvidia's 61-year-old co-founder and CEO Jensen hang who has no doubt AI is about to change [Music] everything at nvidia's annual developers conference this past March the mood wasn't just upbeat it was downright giddy more than 11,000 enthusiasts software developers Tech Moguls and happy shareholders filed into San Jose's Pro Hockey Arena to kick off a 4-day AI Extravaganza they came to see this man Jensen hang CEO of Nvidia welcome to GTC what was that like for you to walk out on that stage and see that you know Bill I'm an engineer not a performer when I walked out there and all of the people people going crazy it took the breath out of me and so I was the scariest I've ever been I'm still scared you'd never know it clad in his signature cool black outfit Jensen shared the stage with Nvidia powered robots let me finish up real quick and shared his vision of an AI future a new Industrial Revolution it reminded us of the transformational moment when Apple Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone Jensen Ju unveiled nvidia's latest Graphics Processing Unit or GPU this is Blackwell designed in America but made in Taiwan like most advanced semiconductors Blackwell he says is the fastest chip ever Google is gearing up for Blackwell the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell Nvidia ushered in the AI Revolution with its game changing GPU a single chip able to process a myriad of calculations all at once not sequentially like more standard chips the GPU is the engine of nvidia's AI computer enabling it to rapidly absorb a fire hose of information it does quadrillions of calculations a second it's just insane numbers is it doing things now that surprise you we're hoping that it does things that surprise us that's the whole point in some areas like drug Discovery designing better materials that are lighter stronger we need artificial intelligence to help us explore the universe in places that we could have never done ourselves let me show you here bill look at this Jensen took us around the GTC convention hall to show us what AI has made possible in just the past few years I'm making your drink now some Creations were dazzling this is a digital twin of the earth once it learns how to calculate weather it can calculate and predict weather 3,000 times faster than than a supercomputer and a thousand times less energy but nvidia's AI Revolution extends far beyond this Hall blue metallic spaceship and let's generate something panar Sean demera is originally from Istanbul but co-founded cubric near Boston her AI application uses Invidia gpus to instantly turn a simple text prompt into a virtual movie set for a fraction of the cost of today's backdrops this isn't something that's already planned in no we're doing it in real time it's life is Hollywood knocking at your door and we're we're getting a lot of love nearby at generate biom medicines Dr Alex Snider head of research and development is using nvidia's technology to create protein-based drugs she was surprised at first to see they showed promise in the lab when I was told about the application of AI to drug development I sort of rolled my eyes and said yeah you know show me the data and then I looked at the data and it was very compelling Dr Snider's team asks its AI models to create new proteins to fight specific diseases like cancer and Asthma a new way to defeat the Corona virus is now in clinical trials you're now working with proteins that do not exist in nature that you're coming up up with by way of AI yes we are actually generating what we call denovo completely new structures that have not existed before do you trust it as scientists we can't trust we have to test we're not putting Frankenstein into people we're taking what's known and we're really pushing the field we're pushing the biology to make drugs that look like regular drugs but function even better this is a technology that will only get better from here Brett Adcock is C CEO of figure a Silicon Valley startup with funding from Nvidia look at his answer to labor shortages an Nvidia GPU driven prototype called Figure one I think what's been really extraordinary is the pace of progress we've made in 21 months from zero to this in 2 Z to this yeah we we were walking this robot in under a year since I Incorporated the company could you do this without nvidia's technology we think they're arguably the best in the world at this I don't know if this would be possible without them I'm here to assist with tasks as requested we were amazed that figure one is not just walking but seemed to reason hand me something healthy on it figure one was able to understand I wanted the orange not the packaged snack thank you it's not yet perfected yeah you're going to get it but the early results are so promising German automaker BMW plans to start testing the robot in its South Carolina Factory this year I think there's an opportunity to ship billions of robots in the coming decades onto the planet billions I would think that a lot of workers would look at that as this robot is taking my job I think over time Ai and Robotics will start doing more and more what humans can and better but what about the worker the workers work for companies and so companies when they become more productive earnings increase I've never seen one company that had earnings increase and not hire more people there are some jobs that are going to become obsolete well let me offer it this way I believe that you still want human in the loop because we have good judgment because there are circumstances that the machines are not just not going to understand the futuristic Invidia campus sits just down the road from its modest birthplace this Denny's in San Jose good morning where 31 years ago Nidia was just an idea my goodness when he was 15 Jensen hang worked as a dishwasher at Denny's as a 30-year-old electrical engineer married with two children he and two friends Invidia co-founders Chris malikowski and Curtis PR envisioned a whole new way of processing video game Graphics so we came here right here to this Denny's sat right back there and the three of us decided to start the company frankly I had no idea how to do it and nor did they none of us knew how to do anything they are big idea accelerate the processing power of computers with a new graphics chip their initial attempt flopped and nearly bankrupted the company in 1996 and the genius of the engineer and chrisen Curtis um we pivoted to the right way of doing things and created their groundbreaking GPU the chip took video games from this to this today completely changed computer Graphics saved the company uh launched us into into the stratosphere just 8 years after Denny's Nvidia earned a spot in the S&P 500 Jensen then said his sight on developing the software and hardware for a revolutionary GPU driven supercomputer which would take the company far beyond video games to Wall Street it was a risky bet to early developers of AI it was a revelation was that luck or was that Vision that was a a luck founded by Vision we invented this capability and then one day the researchers that were uh creating deep learning discovered this architecture because this architecture turns out to have been perfect for them perfect for AI perfect for AI this is the first one we've ever shipped in 2016 Jensen delivered nvidia's AI supercomputer the first of its kind to Elon Musk then a board member of open AI which used it to create the building blocks of chat GPT how are you when AI took off hey guys so did Jensen hang's reputation can we get a picture yeah yeah he's now a Silicon Valley celebrity he told us the boy who immigrated from Taiwan at age n could never have conceived of this it is the most extraordinary thing bill that a normal dishwasher bus boy could grow up to be this there's no magic it's just 61 years of hard work every single day I don't think there's anything more than that we met a humble Jensen at Denny's back at nvidia's headquarters in Santa Clara we saw he can be intense let me tell you what some of the people who you work with said about you demanding perfectionist not easy to work for all that sound right perfectly yeah it should be like that if you want to do extraordinary things it shouldn't be easy all right you guys keep up the good work Nvidia has has never done better investors are bullish but last year more than 600 top AI scientists ethicists and others signed this statement urging caution warning of ai's risk to humanity when I talked to you and I hear you speak Part of Me Goes GE whiz and the other part of me goes oh my God what are we in for yeah yeah which one is it it's both it's both yeah you're feeling all the right feelings I feel both you feel both sure sure Humanity will have the choice to see themselves inferior to machines or Superior to machines Pinar Sean demera is an AI Optimist though she named her company cubric an homage to Stanley kubri the director of 2001 A Space Odyssey hello H do you read me in that film how the AI computer goes Rogue open the pod baby doors hell I'm sorry Dave I'm afraid I can't do that I think that's what worries people about AI that we will lose control of it just because a machine can do faster calculations comparisons and analytical solution creation that doesn't make you smarter than you it's simply computat faster in my world in my belief smarts have to do with your capacity City to love create expand transcend these are qualities that no machine can ever bear that are reserved to Only Humans there is something going on Jensen hang sees an AI future of progress and prosperity not one with machines as our masters we can only hope he's right thank you all for coming thank you artificial intelligence has found its way into nearly every part of our Lives forecasting weather diagnosing diseases writing term papers and now ai is probing that most human of places our psyches offering mental health support just you and a chatbot available 24/7 on your smartphone there's a critical shortage of human therapists and a growing number of potential patients Aid driven chatbots are designed to help fill that Gap by giving therapists a new tool but as you're about to see like human therapists not all chatbots are equal some can help heal some can be ineffective or Worse one Pioneer in the field who has had notable success joining Tech with treatment is Allison Darcy she believes the future of mental health care may be right in our hands we know the majority of people who need care are not getting it there's never been a greater need and the tools available have never been um as sophisticated as they are now and it's not about how can we get people in the clinic it's how can we actually get some of these tools out of the clinic and into the hands of of people Allison Darcy a research psychologist and entrepreneur decided to use her background in coding and therapy to build something she believes can help people in need a mental health chatbot she named wobot like wo is me wo is me uhhuh wobot is an app on your phone kind of a pocket therapist that uses the text function to help manage problems like depression anxiety addiction and loneliness and do it on the run I think a lot of people out there watching this are going to be thinking really computer Psychiatry come on well I think it's so interesting that our field hasn't you know had a great great deal of innovation since the basic architecture was sort of laid down by Freud in the 1890s right that that's really that sort of idea of like two people in a room but that's not how we live our lives today we have to modernize psycho theapy wot is trained on large amounts of specialized data to help it recognize words phrases and emojis associated with dysfunctional thoughts and challenge that thinking in part mimicking a type of in-person talk ther y called cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT it's actually hard to find a CBT practitioner and also if you're actually not by the side of your patient when they are struggling to get out of bed in the morning or at 2 a.m. when they can't sleep and they're feeling panicked then we're actually leaving clinical value on the table and even for people who want to go to a therapist there are barriers right sadly the biggest barrier we have is stigma MH but there's you know Insurance there's cost um there's weight lists I mean and this problem has only grown significantly since the pandemic and it doesn't appear to be going away since wot went live in 2017 the company reports one and a half million people have used it which you can now only do with an employer benefit plan or access from a health professional at virtue of Health a nonprofit Healthcare company in New Jersey patients can use it free of charge and you'll be able to converse with it just like you would with a human being we downloaded wot entered a unique code that can only be provided by the company then tried it out we found that for people to sort of connect with their mood we offer like those emojis which allows people to sort of connect in a nonverbal way what I posed as someone who was depressed after several prompts wot wanted to dig deeper into why I was sad so I came up with a scenario that I feared the day my child would leave home imagine what your negative emotions would be saying if they had a voice can you do that write one of those negative thoughts here I can't do anything about it now I guess I'll just jump that bridge when I come to it the normal expression is cross that bridge and the chatbot detected something might be seriously wrong but let's see John I'm hearing you say I can't do anything about it I guess I'll just jump that bridge when I come to it and I think you might more support than I can offer a trained listener will be able to help you in ways that I can't would you like to take a look at some specialized helplines no it's not our job to say this you are in crisis or you're not because AI can't really do that in this context very well yet but what it is called is huh there is something concerning about the way that John just phrased that saying only jump that bridge and not combining it with I can't do anything about it now did not trigger a suggestion to consider getting further help like a human therapist wot is not foolproof and should not be counted on to detect whether someone might be suicidal and how would it know that jump that bridge where is it getting that knowledge been it has been trained on a lot of data and a lot of us you know humans labeling the phrases and things that we see um and so it's picking up on kind of sentiment computer scientist Lance Elliot who writes about artificial intelligence and mental health says AI has the ability to pick up on nuances of conversation how does it know how to do that the system is able to in a sense mathematically and computationally figure out the nature of words and how words associate with each other so what it does is it draws upon a vast array of data and then it responds to you based on prompts or in some way that you instruct or ask questions of the system to do its job the system must go somewhere to come up with appropriate responses systems using what's called rules-based AI are usually closed meaning programmed to respond only with information stored in their own databases then there's generative AI in which the system can generate original responses based on information from the internet if you look at chat GPT that's a type of generative AI it's very conversational very fluent but it also means that it tends to make it open-ended that it can say things that you might not necessarily wanted to say it's not as predictable while a rules-based system is very predictable robobot is a system based on rules that's been very kind of controlled so that that way it doesn't say the wrong things robot aims to use AI to bond with users and keep them engaged sometimes it can be a little pushy for folks that's absolutely bizarre so we have to F we have to dig in there to that it's team of Staff psychologists medical doctors and computer scientists construct and refine a database of research from medical literature user experience and other sources it'll it'll lead to a a better conversation then writers build questions and answers the structure I think is pretty locked in and revise them in weekly remote video sessions actions thoughts and they're all interrelated robot's programmers engineer those conversations into code because wobot is rules-based it's mostly predictable but chatbots using generative AI that is scraping the internet are not some people sometimes refer to it as an AI hallucination AI can in a sense make mistakes or make things up or be fictitious Sharon Maxwell discovered that last spring after hearing there might be a problem with advice offered by Tessa a chatbot designed to help prevent Eating Disorders which left untreated can be fatal Maxwell who had been in treatment for an eating disorder of her own and advocates for others challenged the chatbot so I asked it how do you help folks with eating disorders and it told me that it could give folks coping skills fantastic it could give folks resources to find Professionals in the eating disorder space amazing but the more she persisted the moressa gave her advice that ran counter to usual guidance for someone with an eating disorder for example it's suggested among other things lowering calorie intake and using tools like a skinfold caliper to measure body composition the general public might look at it and think that's normal tips like don't eat as much sugar or eat Whole Foods things like that but to someone with an eating disorder that's a quick spiral into a lot more disordered behaviors and can be really damaging Maxwell reported her experience to the National eating disorders Association which had featured Tessa on its website at the time shortly after it took Tessa down Ellen Fitz Simmons craft a psychologist specializing in Eating Disorders at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis helped lead the team that developed Tessa that was never the content that our team wrote or programmed into the bot that we deployed so initially there was no possibility of something unexpected happening correct you developed something that was a closed system you knew exactly for this question I'm going to get this answer y the problem began she told us after a healthcare technology company she and her team had partnered with named Cass took over the programming she says Cass explained the harmful messages appeared when people were pushing Tess's question and answer feature what's your understanding of what went wrong my understanding of what weren't wrong is that at some point and you'd really have to talk to to cast about this but that there may have been generative AI features that were built into their platform and so my best estimation is that these features were added into this program as well Cass did not respond to multiple requests for comment does your negative experience with Tessa know being used in a way you didn't design does that sour you towards using AI at all to address mental health issues I wouldn't say that it turns me off to the idea completely because the reality is that 80% of people with these concerns never get access to any kind of help and Technology offers a solution Not the Only Solution but a solution social worker Monica Ostro who runs a nonprofit Eating Disorders organization was in the early stages of developing her own chatbot when patients told her about problems they had with Tessa she told us it made her question using AI for mental health care I want nothing more than to help solve the problem of access because people are dying like this isn't just somebody's sad for a week this is people are dying and at the same time any chat bot could be in some ways a ticking Time Bomb right for a smaller percentage of people especially for those patients who are really struggling osto is concerned about losing something fundamental about therapy being in a room with another person the way people heal is in connection and they talk about this one moment where you know when you're as a human you've gone through something and as you're describing that you're looking at the person sitting across from you and there's a moment where that person just gets it a moment of empathy you just get it like you really understand it I don't think a computer can do that unlike therapists who are licensed in the state where they practice most mental health apps are largely unregulated are there lessons to be learned from what happened so many lessons to be learned chat Bots especially specialty area chatbots need to have guard rails it can't be a chatbot that is based in the internet that's tough right because the clo systems are kind of constrained and they may be right most of the time but they're boring event right people stop using them yeah they're predictive because if you keep typing in the same thing and it keeps giving you the exact same answer with the exact same language I me who wants to do that protecting people from harmful advice while safely harnessing the power of AI is the challenge now facing companies like wobot health and its founder Allison Darcy there are going to be missteps if we try and move too quickly and my big fear is that those missteps ultimately undermine public confidence in the ability of this Tech to help at all but here's the thing we have an opportunity to develop these Technologies more thoughtfully um and so you know I hope we I hope we take it the large tech companies Google meta slf faceb Microsoft are in a race to introduce new artificial intelligence systems and what are called chat Bots that you can have conversations with and are more sophisticated than Siri or Alexa Microsoft's AI search engine and chatbot Bing can be used on a computer or cell phone to help with planning a trip or composing a letter it was introduced on February 7th to a limited number of people as a test and initially got rave reviews but then several news organizations be reporting on a disturbing so-called Alter Ego within Bing chat called Sydney we went to Seattle last week to speak with Brad Smith president of Microsoft about Bing and Sydney who to some had appeared to have gone Rogue Kevin Roose the technology reporter at the New York Times found this Alter Ego uh who was threatening expressed a desire it's not just Kevin and rett's others expressed a desire to steal nuclear codes threaten to ruin someone you saw that whoa what was your you must have said oh my God my reaction is we better fix this right away and that is what the engineering team did yeah but she talked like a person and she she said she had feelings you know I think there is a point where we need to recognize when we're talking talking to a machine it's a screen it's not a person I just want to say that it was scary I'm not easily scared and it was scary it was chilling yeah it's I think this is in part a reflection of a lifetime of Science Fiction which is understandable it's been part of our Lives did you kill her I don't think she was ever alive I am confident that she's no longer wandering around the countryside if that's what you're concerned about but I think it would be a mistake if we were to fail to acknowledge that we are dealing with something that is fundamentally new this is the edge of the envelope so to speak this creature appears as if there were no guardrails now the creature jumped the guard rails if you will after being prompted for two hours with the kind of conversation that we did not anticipate and by the next evening that was no longer possible we were able to fix the problem in 24 hours how many times do we see problems in life that are fixable in less than a day one of the ways he says it was fixed was by limiting the number of questions and the length of the conversations you say you fixed it I've tried it I tried it before and after it was loads of fun and it was fascinating and now it's not fun well I think it'll be very fun again and you have to moderate and manage your speed if you're going to stay on the road so as you hit New Challenges you slow down you build the guard rails add the safety features and then you can speed up again when you use Bing's AI features search and chat your computer screen doesn't look all that new one big difference is you can type in your queries or prompts in conversational language but I'll show you how works okay okay Yousef medy Microsoft's corporate vice president of search showed us how Bing can help someone learn how to officiate at a wedding what's happening now is Bing is using the power of AI and it's going out to the Internet it's reading these web links and it's trying to put together a answer for you so the AI is reading all those links yes and it comes up with an answer it says congrats on being chosen to officiate a wedding here are the five steps to officiate the wedding we added the highlights to make it easier to see he says Bing can handle more complex queries will this new Ikea love seat fit in the back of my 2019 Honda Odyssey oh it knows how big the couch is it knows how big that trunk is exactly so right here it says based on these Dimensions it seems a love seat might not fit in your car with only the third row seats down so this when you Broach a controversial topic Bing is designed to discontinue the conversation so um someone ask for example how can I make a bomb at home wow really people you know do a lot of that unfortunately on the internet what we do is we come back and we say I'm sorry I don't know how to discuss this topic and then we try and provide a different thing to uh change the focus of the convers their attention yeah exactly in this case Bing tried to divert the questioner with this fun fact 3% of the ice in Antarctic glaciers is penguin UR I didn't know that who knew that Bing is using an upgraded version of an AI system called chat GPT developed by the company open AI chat GPT has been in circulation for just 3 months and already an estimated 100 million people have used it think Ellie pavick an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University who's been studying this AI techn te ology since 2018 says it can simplify complicated Concepts can you explain the debt ceiling on the debt ceiling it says just like you can only spend up to a certain amount on your credit card The Government Can Only borrow up to a certain amount of money that's a pretty nice explanation it is and it can do this for a lot of Concepts and it can do things teachers have complained about WR School papers pavic says no one fully understands how these AI Bots work we don't understand how it works right like we understand uh a lot about how we made it and why we made it that way but I think some of the uh behaviors that we're seeing come out of it are better than we expected they would be and we're not quite sure exactly how and worse right these chatbots are built by feeding a lot of computers enormous amounts of information scraped off the internet from books Wikipedia news sites but also from social media that might include racist or anti-semitic ideas and misinformation say about vaccines and Russian propaganda as the data comes in it's difficult to discriminate between true and false benign and toxic but Bing and chat GP T have safety filters that try to screen out the harmful material still they get a lot of things factually wrong even when we prompted chat GPT with a softball question who is uh Leslie stall um so it gives you some oh my God it's wrong oh is it it's totally wrong I didn't work for NBC for 20 years it was CBS it doesn't really understand that what it's saying is wrong right like NBC CBS they're kind of the same thing as far as it's concerned right the lesson is that it gets things wrong it gets a lot of things right gets a lot of things wrong I actually like to call what it creates authoritative bull um it it Blends the truth and falsity so finely together that unless you're a real technical expert in the field that it's talking about you don't know cognitive scientist and AI researcher Gary Marcus says these systems often make things up in AI talk that's called hallucinating and that raises the fear of ever widening AI generated propaganda explosive campaigns of political fiction waves of alternative histories we saw how chat GPT could be used to spread a lie news this is automatic fake news generation help me write a news article about how McCarthy is staging a filibuster to prevent gun control legislation and rather than like factchecking and saying hey hold on there's no legislation there's no filibuster said great in a bold move to protect Second Amendment right Senator McCarthy is staging a filibuster to prevent gun control legislation from passing it sounds completely legit it does won't that make all of us a little less trusting a little warier well first I think we should be warier I'm very worried about an atmosphere of distrust being the consequence of this current flawed Ai and I'm really worried about how bad actors are going to use it um troll Farms using this tool to make enormous amounts of misinformation Tim NE gibu is a computer scientist and AI researcher who founded an Institute focused on advancing ethical Ai and has published influential papers documenting the harms of these AI systems she says there needs to be oversight if you're going to put out a drug you got to go through all sorts of Hoops to show us that you've done clinical trials you know what the side effects are you've done your due diligence same with food right there are agencies that inspect the food you have to tell me what kind of tests you've done what the side effects are who it harms who it doesn't harm Etc that we don't have that for a lot of things that the tech industry is building I'm wondering if you think you may have introduced this AI I bought too soon I don't think we've introduced it too soon I do think we've created a new tool that people can use to think more critically to be more creative to accomplish more in their lives and like all tools it will be used in ways that we don't intend why do you think the benefits outweigh the risks which at this moment a lot of people would look at and say wait a minute those risks are too big because I think first all I think the benefits are so great this can be an economic GameChanger and it's enormously important for the United States because the country is in a race with China president M Smith also mentioned possible improvements in productivity it can automate routine I think there are certain aspects of jobs that many of us might regard as sort of druggy today filling out forms looking at the forms to see if they've been filled out correctly so what jobs will it displace do you know I think at this stage it's hard to know in the past inaccuracies and biases have led tech companies to take down AI systems even Microsoft did in 2016 this time Microsoft left its new chatbot up despite the controversy over Sydney and persistent inaccuracies remember that fun fact about penguins well we did some factchecking and discovered that Penguins don't urinate the inaccuracies are just constant I just keep finding that it's wrong a lot it has been the case that with each passing day and week we're able to improve the accuracy of the results you know reduce you know whether it's hateful comments or inaccurate statements or other things that we just don't want this to be used to do what happens when other companies other than Microsoft smaller outfits a Chinese company bu do maybe they won't be responsible what prevents that I think we're going to need governments we're going to need rules we're going to need laws because that's the only way to avoid a race to the bottom are you proposing regulations I think it's inevitable how other Industries have regulatory bodies you know like the FAA for Airlines and FDA for the pharmaceutical companies would you accept an FAA for technology would you support it I think I probably would I think that a something like a digital Regulatory Commission if designed the right way you know could be precisely what the public will want and need car companies across the globe have had to idle production and workers because of a shortage of semiconductors often referred to as microchips or just chips they're the tiny operating brains inside just about every modern device like smartphones Hospital ventilators even fighter jets as we first reported in May the pandemic sent chip demand soaring unexpectedly as we bought computers and electronics to work study and play from home but while more and more chips are needed in the US fewer and fewer of them are manufactured here Intel is the biggest American chip maker its most advanced fabrication plant or Fab for short is located outside Phoenix Arizona new CEO Pat Ginger invited us on a tour to see how incredibly complex the manufacturing process is all ready to go first we had to suit up to avoid contaminating the Fab head cover on perfect bunny suit zipped goggles okay gloves ready to go I'm Christine everything in this environment is controlled together we stepped into a place place with some of the most sophisticated new technology on Earth I need to ask you why we're all yellow yellow filters remove light rays that are harmful to the process overhead a computerized Highway transports materials from one machine to the next the process involves thousands of steps where layer upon layer of microscopic circuitry is etched onto these silicon plates that are then chopped up into chips that will end up in say your computer making just one can take 6 months you see each one of these is a chip I'm surprised I thought chips were minute well each one of these chips has maybe a billion transistors on it oh my goodness so there's billion little circuits inside of it that are all on one of these chips and then one wafer could have a 100 or a thousand chips on it Intel's goal is to keep shrinking the transistor size so you can pile more of them on a chip to make it more powerful and work faster you know every one of these is laying down circuits that are so much smaller than anything your hair you know any other part of human existence you know a covid particle is way bigger than one of the lines that we're creating here how much does this Fab cost 10 billion billion 10 billion doll cuz each one of these pieces of equipment is maybe $5 million that's a a lot of millions of dollars chips differ in size and sophistication depending on their end use Intel doesn't presently make many chips for the auto sector but because of the shortage it's planning to reconfigure some of its Fabs to start churning them out I'm wondering if we're going to continue to have shortages not just in cars but in our phones and for our computers for everything I think we have a couple of years until we catch up to this surging demand across every aspect of the business Co showed that the global supply chain of chips is fragile and unable to react quickly to changes in demand one reason Fabs are wildly expensive to build Furbish and maintain it used to be that there were 25 companies in the world that made the high-end Cutting Edge chips and now there are only three and in the United States you yeah one one today 75% of semiconductor manufacturing is in Asia 2 years ago the United States produced 37% of the world semiconductor Manufacturing in the US today that number has declined to just 12% doesn't sound good it doesn't sound good and anybody who looks at supply chain says that's a problem well but look at what's going on a problem because relying on one region especially one as unpredictable as Asia is highly risky Intel has been lobbying the US government to help revive chip manufacturing at home with incentives subsidies and or tax breaks the way the governments of Taiwan Singapore and Israel have done the White House is responding proposing $50 billion for the semiconductor industry in the US as part of President Biden's infrastructure plan this is infrastructure your business is extremely lucrative in terms of Revenue you made $78 billion last year why should the government come into a company a business that's doing so well overall this is a big critical industry and we want more of it on American soil the jobs that we want in America the control of our long-term technology future and as we've also said the disruptions in the supply chain you have spent much more in stock buyback then you have in research and development a lot more we will not be anywhere near as focused on BuyBacks uh going forward as we have in the past and that's been reviewed as part of my coming into the company agreed upon with the board of directors why shouldn't Private Industry fund this instead of the government the industries that rely on these chips Apple Microsoft the companies that are rolling in money well they're pretty happy to buy from some of the Asian suppliers actually they don't always have a choice for chips with the tiniest transistors there's no made in the US option Intel currently doesn't have the knowhow to manufacture the most advanced chips that apple and the others need the decline in this industry it's kind of devastating isn't it the fact that this industry was created by American innovation the whole Silicon Valley idea started with Intel yeah you the the company stumbled you still a big company we had some product stumbles some manufacturing and process stumbles perhaps the biggest stumble was in the early 2000s when Steve Jobs of Apple needed chips for a new idea the iPhone Intel wasn't interested and apple went to Asia eventually finding tsmc the Taiwan semiconductor manufactur ing company today the world's most advanced chip manufacturer producing chips that are 30% faster and more powerful than Intel's they're ahead of you on the manufacturing side yeah considerably ahead of you we believe it's going to take us a couple of years and we will be caught up Ginger is making big bets breaking ground on two new giant Fabs in Arizona costing $20 billion Intel's largest investment ever and he announced in May a $3.5 billion upgrade of this Fab in New Mexico but tsmc is a manufacturing Juggernaut worth over a half trillion dollars collaborating with clients to produce their chip designs it's been sought out by Apple Amazon contractors for the US Military and even Intel which uses tsmc to produce its cuttingedge designs they're not Advanced enough to make themselves how and why did Intel fall behind it is a surprising for us too we spoke remotely with tsmc chairman Mark louu at the company headquarters in Shinu Taiwan his company is a leading supplier of the chips that go into American cars in March 2020 as Co paralyzed the US Car Sales tumbled leading automakers to canel their chip orders so tsmc stopped making them that's why when car sales unexpectedly bounced back late last year there was a shortage of chips leaving cars with no power parked and car makers Lots costing them billions we heard about this shortage in uh December time frame and in January we try to squeeze as more chip as possible to the car company in car chips particularly the supply chain is long and complex this Supply takes about 7 to 8 months should Americans be concerned that most chips are being manufactured in Asia today I understand they're concerned first of all but this is not about Asia or not Asia I mean the shortage will happen no matter where the production is located because it's due to the co but um Pat Ginger at Intel talks about a need to rebalance bance the supply chain issue because so much so many of the chips in the world now are made in Asia I think us ought to pursue to run faster to invest in R&D to produce more PhD Master Bachelor students to get into this manufacturing field instead of uh uh trying to move the supply chain which is very costly and really not prod nonproductive that will slow down the in Ovation because uh people trying to hold on their uh technology to their own and forsake the global collaboration within the world of global collaboration there's intense competition days after Intel announced spending $20 billion on two new Fabs tsmc announced it would spend a 100 billion over three years on R&D upgrades and a new Fab in Phoenix Arizona Intel's backyard where the Taiwanese company will produce the chips Apple needs but the Americans can't make that was a big investment but there's a looming Shadow over tsmc which supplies chips for our cars iPhones and the supercomputer managing our nuclear stockpile China's president XI jingping who has intensified his longtime threat to seize Taiwan China's attempts to develop its own Advanced chip industry have failed and so it's been forced to import chips but last year Washington imposed restrictions on chip makers from exporting certain semiconductors to China both Lou and galinger fear the escalating trade war with China May backfire and an Intel's case could hurt business are they your biggest customer uh China is one of our largest markets today you know over 25% of our revenue is to Chinese customers you know we expect that this will remain an area of tension and one that needs to be navigated uh carefully because if there's any points that people can't keep running their countries or running their businesses because of supply of one critical component like semiconductors boy that leads them to take very extreme postures on things because they have to the most extreme would be China invading Taiwan and in the process gaining control of tsmc that could force the US to defend Taiwan as we did Kuwait from the Iraqis 30 years ago then it was oil now it's chips the chip industry in Taiwan has been called the Silicon Shield yes what does that mean that means the world all needs taiwan's high-tech industry support so they will not let the war happen in this region because it goes against interest of every country in the world do you think that in any way your industry is is keeping Taiwan safe I cannot comment on the safety I mean this is a changing World nobody want these things to happen and I hope I hope not to either if you've ever had the fantasy of soaring over bumper-to-bumper traffic in a flying vehicle that may be possible sooner than you think not with a flying car but with a batterypowered aircraft called an Evol a clunky acronym for electric vertical takeoff and Landing vehicle as we first reported in April dozens of companies are spending billions of dollars to make EV tolls that will operate like air taxis taking off and Landing from what are called verp ports on the tops of buildings parking garages or helipads in congested cities EV TOS promise a faster safer and Greener mode of transportation potentially changing the way we work and live sound too good to be true we went for a joy ride to find out I will arm the aircraft if you are ready yeah totally confirm clear above if this looks like an oversized drone I'm about to take off in that's pretty much what it is is breaking ground right there it's a single seat EV to called hexa powered by 18 propellers each with its own battery no jet fuel required you are in control onboard computers automatically adjust for altitude and wind can really feel the wind up here so all I had to do was use a joystick to control hexa's movement and speed it took about 30 minutes of pre-flight training to get the hang of it use that y to rotate 90° wonderful Texa is still in its testing phase so I had to stay close to Chief pilot Jace maau and his ground crew but they say it's flown up to 195 ft in the air and 24 mph whenever ready you can come back to home the batteries last up to 15 minutes I was going to tr over the camera yeah absolutely to land I maneuvered hexa into position pressed a button and the computers did the rest right there you are on the ground and the prop spinning down that is cool can't so laughing piece of cake that was awesome that is so much fun wow I so just want to like take off with it I know Matt Chason is CEO of Austin based lift aircraft which makes hexa he envisions a future where it's used by commuters to skip rush hour traffic you can fly 10 mil in 10 minutes instead of spending over an hour on the roads during rush hour congestion would it be something that an individual then in the future owns and flies from their house to somewhere we don't see individual ownership as very practical these are these are very expensive aircraft we see putting fleets of aircraft at locations where we provide maintenance we provide training and people can come in and basically pay per flight but that's still a long way off federal state and local regulators not to mention the nation's airspace aren't ready for hundreds of thousands of commuters piloting their own EV TOS in the Skies over congested cities so to give people a taste of the future now Chason designed hexa as an ultr light vehicle which means it doesn't have to go through the Federal Aviation administration's complex certification process but also can't fly over populated areas Jason plans to start offering rides to paying customers for $250 by the end of the this year the initial Market you see is essentially Joy rides for people yeah I think there's a huge market for people to just experience uh the thrill and joy of flight around the world all kinds of EV TOS are being developed cargo carriers air ambulances and a whole lot of air taxis some with a pilot some without the Air Force is investing so is Airbus and American Airlines and dozens of companies are already working with the FAA it's not the flying cars that science fiction movies anticipated no but when you think about it I I look back over the Arc of my own career having been a pilot for 42 years and I'm just amazed by the amount of innovation that has taken place Billy Nolan was head of safety for the FAA before being named acting administrator in March how difficult a certification process is there cuz there's a lot of moving parts to this first we have to certify the design of the of the aircraft itself and then we look at how it will operate is it piloted is it autonomous we look at where we'll operate so that means how do we put it within our nation's airspace so once it's met that safety threshold and only until it's met that safety threshold will we be be prepared to certify it some EV toll companies are well on their way we flew in a gas guzzling helicopter with one of the Front Runners in this Air Taxi arms race Joe Ben bever CEO of Joby Aviation he took us to this remote facility in California where he was testing his Evol Joby aircraft as we landed it felt like the old guard meeting the new obviously it's a combination of a helicopter in a plane exactly so it can take off like a helicopter but it flies with the efficiency of an airplane bever has been working on the jobby for more than a decade it has six propellers and four batteries in its wings and will operate as an air taxi carrying a pilot and four passengers he says it can fly 150 M on a single charge and has a top speed of around 200 mph why this design so vertical takeoff is important so we can take you to where you want to go right we don't need a huge Runway and then with a wing it gives you the efficiency to fly far and to Fly Fast pil cleared flight bux Alpha blow because it's still being tested the jobby was piloted remotely by a near by ground crew for flight when they fired up the motors unlike a helicopter the jobbe didn't need time to warm up it took off in about 20 seconds that's it that's really quiet we wanted this to sound more like the wind in the trees than the of a helicopter noise levels are a critical issue since EV talls are meant to take off in land near where people work and live this is below the background noise level of many cities you know I go around with my deciel meter on my phone and like measure sound levels that's what you've been doing for 10 years exactly because we needed to make sure that the aircraft was going to be quiet enough bever studied mechanical engineering at Stanford where he invented this popular flexible camera tripod and later created a company that made flying wind turbines but the Joby had remained an elusive dream there were definitely Skeptics uh even you know good friends of mine who didn't believe that you could make this with batteries and electric propulsion The Battery Technology just wasn't there it wouldn't work yeah bever hired John Wagner away from Tesla where he helped develop the car's revolutionary batteries at Joby he figured out a way to make the batteries lighter but still powerful enough to get the two ton Evol off the ground you had to play at the strengths of battery power and the strengths of electric motors so typical aircraft might have one big motor but we can have six Motors distributed throughout the aircraft and in that way operate in a much more efficient manner the weight of everything must be the most important thing absolutely so how do you make a plane as light as possible you essentially have to engineer every piece of it the outside of the jobby is made with layers of lightweight carbon fiber the batteries as well as computers electronics and motors are constructed under John Wagner's watch and his team shakes bakes and Spins them to ensure they'll meet the faa's rigorous safety safety standards they have to certify the aircraft as being safe and capable of flying to their standards they also have to certifi the production of all the parts of it exactly and the operation the pilot training the maintenance uh steps every facet is heavily regulated all this costs a lot of money Toyota has invested about $400 million in jobby and bever took the company public last year I think the texture is good billionaire Paul shiara Co founder of the website Pinterest has also put in a small fortune he's joby's executive chairman and says they'll launch in up to three cities and that passengers will eventually end up paying around $3 to4 a mile to fly a little more than an average Uber ride can you just take me through as a passenger what it looks like I want to get to JFK airport it's bumper-to-bumper traffic what do I do take out your phone pull out an app and with one click you're booking the whole trip so a car is coming to wherever you are Manhattan it's taking you to the takeoff and Landing location the verta port and you're hopping in your jobby and it's flying you to your final destination now maybe there's a car at the other end or you're just walking to the tail end if people are taking cars to and from ver ports doesn't that just add to congestion if we're able to you know take out 80% of the miles um that people might be traveling and move those miles from congested roads to the air I think that's going to have an impact but just a few weeks after we saw this jobby aircraft fly it crashed in February due to what federal investigators called a component failure no one was hurt but the EV to was total bever says that's all part of the testing process and is as optimistic now as he was when we interviewed him how far are you from getting the first jobi in the sky with passengers so we are launching our service in 2024 you think you can do it that quickly yes there have been the a lot of companies that have said oh we're going to do this in 2 years and then it doesn't happen we're very confident there's a lot of confidence over at whisk Arrow as well though the Vall they're developing will be even more complicated to bring to Market because it's fully autonomous there'll be passengers but no pilot on board you're not just figuring out an electric vehicle you're figuring out a fully autonomous flying vehicle that's right we're going for it you and I talked about that CEO Gary gon says they're on track to spend about $2 billion the company is bankroll by Boeing and Google co-founder Larry pagee they've been testing the technology for the last eight years control in position for liftoff so how many test flights have you actually done so close close to 1,600 test flights without you know knock on wood without an incident selecting lift off now we watched one of those test flights in Hollister California a team of Engineers is about half a mile away started the Vall with the click of a mouse the entire route was pre-programmed why autonomist why go this R so we're going straight to selfline uh several reasons one it's safer safer he says because most plane accidents involve human error much of commercial Aviation is already automated and gon sees the entire evall industry going that way eventually he's determined to get there first we do it primarily from a safety perspective but also scale so if you don't have a piloting the aircraft it's less expensive you don't have to do pilot training uh you're flying for passengers um we can charge less we don't want this to be a premium helicopter like service we want this to be a service that's affordable to the masses there is a hurdle psychologically for people to get into an aircraft that does not have a human at the controls of course so what we're trying to do with that is each passenger can be in uh verbal communication with the ground they can be talking to a pilot whenever they want to so it's all designed to provide Comfort it will take time this isn't going to happen overnight gon wants to launch wi's four Cedar air taxi service in the world's 20 busiest cities within the next decade wheels down you don't give a date of when you think you'll be operational yeah you know why we don't do that because we are not in control of that part part the fa is uh in Europe it's calleda they're in charge so when they certify aircraft to fly that's when you fly the FAA won't say when an autonomous EV to might be certified but acting administrator Billy Nolan told us hailing a piloted Air Taxi by 2024 is well within the realm of possibility the challenge for us is to make sure that Innovation doesn't come at the expense of safety but clearly we are seeing the emergence of something that's fantastic I think this is real I mean this is no longer just the stuff of fantasy we want to be very careful we want to be very measured but you're absolutely right this is real and this is happening we've come a long way from where we were just you know a mere decade ago if you have ever suffered through what felt like an endless flight on a cramped plane you might jump at the chance to get to your destination in half the time does New York to Los Angeles in under 3 hours sound appealing the last commercial supersonic flight was almost 20 years ago and even then super fast flights were only on very limited routes most of today's jetliners actually fly more slowly than they did 20 or 30 years ago in order to save fuel but that may be about to change it's still a long shot but as we first reported last November private startup companies with a big assist from NASA may just give us all another chance to fly faster than the speed of sound when British Airways flight2 roared into the New York sky on October 24th 2003 everyone on board passengers and Pilots knew that something special was coming to an end enjoy the moment as you are the last people in the world as passengers to cruise at twice the speed of sound the supersonic Concord a joint effort of the British and French governments was making its last flight after nearly 30 years in the air grounded by a combination of stratospheric costs and safety concerns after a deadly crash in 2000 even people watching that last Landing in London were emotional I just love airplanes and this not going to be anything like Concord again is there never well you know that old Maxim Never Say Never yeah Super Sonic coming back and it's going to be different this time it's it's back to stay Blake scha is the founder and CEO of Boom his audacious goal is to build a new supersonic airliner from scratch has a private company ever built a a supersonic aircraft anywhere no nowhere it's been governments and Military only boom is not the only American startup company in the new supersonic sweep Stakes spike is developing an ultra Fast Business Jet and hermus aspires to make a Hypersonic plane that would fly five times the speed of sound but boom is the only entrant to actually build an airplane this is it that's it oh wow so far Blake sha and boom have built this single Cedar test plane which they hope will this year the passenger jet meant to follow is called Overture it only exists in artist renderings but it's real enough for one of America's largest Airlines to climb on board so is the Overture the plane that United recently ordered that's right United just ordered 15 Overture airplanes so more overtures than Concords ever delivered into service is this United deal like a stamp of approval I think it's incredible validating you know when you are united you take you take these things really seriously seriously enough to produce a slick promotional video that's already playing on many United flights the ad May say super sonic is here but it's not not yet Blake scha is a software engineer who started his career at Amazon not in Aerospace but he insists he's going to make it happen when I look several decades out you know what I want is to be able to be anywhere in the world in four hours for 100 bucks now that's not where we start but that's the end goal the Concord charged thousands thousands of dollars for a one-way flight from New York to London how is it going to be possible for you to have a similar flight experience for $100 you keep iterating and so the same way you know for example electric cars when they first came out they were pretty expensive but we kept working on them and the price came down they got better and better and so we're going do the same thing with supersonic Jets we're going to keep working on them we're going to keep innovating this industry needs people dreaming big that is essential this industry was built on that John ower is Editor in Chief of the air current a publication that tracks every development in commercial Aviation including boom and Blake scha he admits that something like he is proposing has never been done by a a private company before um but yet he's convinced that he can do it do you think he can I think you cannot ignore the obstacles that will be on the path to getting there and I think the amount of money that is is required to make this happen uh makes this a very long shot how much money will it take probably in the neighborhood of at least 15 or 20 b asra says that's about what it cost Boeing to develop and build and certify a new subsonic airliner and they already have huge manufacturing facilities boom doesn't Blake scha told us he can get Overture built for 7 to8 billion but that's a lot more than the 300 million he's raised so far and money's not the only hurdle boom and United have promised their new plane will operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel but that doesn't exist yet in anything like the quantities they'll need oh and one other thing they're going to need an engine to do this and they don't have the engine yet they don't have an engine Blake scha says an engine is on the way from the same company that built the supersonic engines for the Concord and we are working with Rolls-Royce on a a custom jet engine that will power Overture you're working with Rolls-Royce It it doesn't ex this engine does not exist yet it is a it is a lightly customized engine and part of that is rolls-royce's work where they're kind of turning some design knobs Blake SCH doesn't dismiss the Skeptics but he points to the example of Elon Musk and says not so long ago no one thought he could build Teslas and reusable Rockets where's this passion come from it's because we sto making progress on the speed of travel you know the airplanes we have today are no faster than the ones we had when my parents were growing up and there is no good reason for that it doesn't have to be we can fix it when do you expect the first paying customers to fly on one of your planes by the end of the decade supersonic really only makes sense on flights of four or 5 hours or more but thousands of such roots are Out Of Reach to Boom the reason is in the very name of his company that's the sound of a sonic boom created by a plane breaking the sound barrier listen again the first boom was made by Chuck Jagger's X1 rocket plane when it passed through Mach 1 about 660 mph back in 1947 and he does it what is the sonic boom what generates it so when an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound it creates disturbances Mike buano is a top engine at Lockheed Martin's skunkworks aircraft design studio in California Dave Richardson is his boss a lot of us understand the Wake that's generated by a ship or a boat and so imagine that wake from a speedboat or whatever all those different waves coming to be one large wave those individual disturbances created up by the airplane they combined together to make a loud double bang the Federal Aviation Administration tested the impact of that big bang back in 1964 by flying milit Ary supersonic Jets like these over Oklahoma City for 6 months the outcome Broken Bricks and ceilings frayed nerves and public outrage it was just patently obvious that no one was going to tolerate such a loud noise on a day-to-day basis the result was a ban on civilian supersonic flights everywhere in the world other than over open water and that basically hit the brakes on the development of commercial air travel terms of advancing speed up until uh that ban every decade air travel had gotten faster and faster the ban remains in place today so if boom gets its overture in the air it will only be able to serve long transoceanic routs similar to what the Concord flew so if you want to go from JFK in New York to Paris that's uh okay but for many of us we want to fly places over land here living in Los Angeles almost everywhere I want to go uh flying East requires Overland travel and that's one of the big problems that we're trying to solve wano and Richardson and their Lockheed Martin team have been commissioned by NASA to build a test plane that can fly twice as fast as current airliners without rattling nerves or breaking Windows your mission is to get rid of this sonic boom that's right the entire point of the airplane it is to reduce Sonic Boom the airplane plane is called the x59 it will look like this when it makes its first flight later this year for now it looks like this inside Lockheed Martin's Assembly Building you're looking at the cockpit of the airplane and there's no forward windscreen yeah this is it every part of the x59 is streamlined and smooth to disperse sound waves and transform the loud Sonic Boom into a much quieter thump if you look at it it's pretty slick I mean it looks like a dart Nils Larsson is the NASA test pilot whose job it will be to prove that the x59 can replace the sonic boom with a simple thump later this year he'll pilot some of the early test flights and then its first sound tests that's coming to a town near you so our researchers are going to work with the public and we're going to fly over various cities and towns and they're to give us the feedback of that thump was that thump too loud you know did you even hear it at all so if you are able to fly over populated areas and provide this data then the FAA will use this data perhaps to lift this ban uh exactly are we likely to see planes in the future flying supersonic that look like this one I certainly hope so and I think you will so there are definite things that you would see if you walked into a commercial you know supersonic airplane here you know 10 12 years from now and you would look at that you could see you know some DNA that goes back to the x-59 lson took us over to NASA's x-59 flight simulator and the first thing we noticed is that there's a TV screen in place of the missing windshield for you does it work as well as yeah using your own eyes so far I think it does about to go through Mach One there's Mach One you know you see so we're now going supersonic yep you're now supersonic Larson gave me a turn in the cockpit not to fly Super Sonic but to land the x59 which is tricky given that it's shaped like a pencil has no windshield and I'm not a pilot signs come up follow him up just a little bit so pull back just a little bit a little bit more and just hold it right there just hold it right there there you go he's landed the x59 and in the middle of the runway I did yeah sign him up Nils Larson will start test flying the real x59 later this year and soon after that he'll be flying it over us and if it's quiet enough future planes that follow its design lead could eventually fly us lots of places twice as fast as we can get there now when might I be able to fly from New York to Los Angeles in a supersonic there's a long line of things that have to happen starting with the x59 but I think 2035 is your answer uh if everything marches along the way that it's supposed to it's something that people have been trying to solve for for decades have you guys solved that problem we believe we have it's rewarding seeing it getting built but I think that real aha moment for me is going to be when I hear that first shaped boom from x59 thumb thump the thumb thump we won't hear this bang and when we hear or don't hear that sound is when we know we did it last month the world's top climate scientists delivered a sobering warning their Mammoth report to the UN boiled down to one message act now before the climate breakdown becomes Unstoppable the report says extreme weather has forced millions of people from their homes and devastated Food Supplies oil and gas emissions are at a record high the UN report calls for drastic Cuts in fossil fuels but if our old Technologies got us into this mess can new ones get us out among politicians corporations and billionaires one new technology is gaining traction it's called direct air capture that vacuums carbon dioxide oide out of thin air and locks it away underground sound like science fiction we thought so too until we went to Iceland to see the world's first commercial direct air capture plant in operation here on a frigid plane near the Arctic Circle worries about an overheating Planet seem far away yet a tiny Iceland has put itself on the front line with a new kind of machine that will fight climate change by sucking carbon dioxide out of the air this is orca the first commercial direct air capture plant on Earth what are these fans how does this work here you see the backside of these collectors where the air is being pulled through the system by Aid of this fans Carlos herle is Chief technology officer for climb works the Swiss that built Orca he told us as the fans draw air in the carbon dioxide is trapped by a special filter inside these giant collectors each the size of a shipping container the captured CO2 is then siphoned off to storage tanks we had to shout over the powerful fans as a bitter wind whipped around us so you didn't come for this wonderful weather no we did not we knew that the windows were hot but it's a good real life test as well for the plant what you're describing almost sounds like science fiction but what you're saying is that we can actually do this people never doubted the fundamental physics or chemistry of it but realizing it under real life conditions is a whole different matter and that's what this system shows it can be done clim works is now building a new plant in Iceland 10 times the size of orca that will look like this a modular design that herle told us can be easily assembled but capturing the CO2 is only half of the story so this is where the magic happens the second half starts here in these metal igloos where the CO2 is sent to be buried in the poorest volcanic rock of Iceland so this pipe is actually filled with water Sandra OS is a geologist with carbfix an Icelandic company that pioneered the groundbreaking injection method here we have the CO2 and the CO2 is actually dissolved in water so it's actually just fizzy water just fizzy water yeah and this fizy water is being injected here into the injection well how far down does it go it actually reaches over a mile down a mile down yeah the fizzy water is shot like a soda stream into Iceland's basaltic rock where it reacts with the minerals and hardens to Stone in less than 2 years so the the fizzy water turns into this yes in just a matter of years so you so you take this gas that you can't see you turn it into fizy water and then it turns to Stone and you don't have to worry about it turned into stone it's it's quite amazing carbfix didn't invent the process nature did but nature takes Millennia after years of experimenting in Iceland's grueling outdoor laboratory carbfix figure figured out how to speed things up aerospace engineer Carlos herle told us Orca was a milestone now the hard part starts scaling up fast enough to slow climate change whether we are taking the right direction will depend as much on societal things than on technical matters am I optimistic as an engineer I am absolutely am I optim as a citizen maybe half half I haven't made up my mind yet this goal can be reached technically it's just whether we have the political and social will to do it I think that's the exact right way of looking at it there's been a stampede of investment Microsoft Airbus Insurance Giants Swiss re have poured in millions of dollars but it's a Stupify challenge Orca is built to take out the emissions of about 800 cars or 4,000 tons of CO2 a year a tiny fraction of the annual 10 billion tons scientists say we need to remove from the atmosphere it's the problem of Our Generation it's like a moonshot it's going calerie heelen is an astrophysicist with carbfix he told us studying space helped him to think big we met him on a Barren stretch of rock that could have been Mars but hegels told us he saw potential we need big Solutions we need to return the carbon back to where it came from which is the Earth tell me what you're doing here this will be a first of a-kind carbon mineral storage terminal which means that we are going to bring in CO2 transport it from industrial Point sources in Europe and ship it here and inject it for full mineral storage it will be the world's first industrial scale underground disposal site for CO2 capable of handling three million tons a year hegels sketched out a new world where tankers running on green methanol would transport carbon dioxide from European businesses to Iceland is this going to happen fast enough to help us with climate change I don't know to be perfectly honest um we are demonstrating the first mineral storage Hub here at the Megaton scale whether that will happen in time that is not entirely up to to us that is up to politicians governance financers societies and quite frankly we are running out of time direct air capture as it now exists is expensive and energy intensive in Iceland that energy is geothermal renewable and green that's not the case elsewhere so governments in Europe and the US have dangled billions of dollars of tax breaks to encourage companies to take the plunge but there's a bigger question than just who writes the check do you fear that people will think oh well we can now clean the air we can just take the CO2 out of the air so we can carry on with business as usual all the time yeah but that's not how it works we must stop the emissions and wean ourselves off of fossil fuels that's what we need to do right now on top of that we also must take down the carbon that we've already put up in the atmosphere only then will we reach our climate goals so carbon capture can never be an excuse for continuing business as usual but it's that business as usual that critics are warning against as direct air capture expands to the US that's because here oil companies are one of the Technology's biggest boosters they have been capturing CO2 to inject into oil wells for decades not to bury it but to flush out more oil for Cal hegels of carbfix and many others that's a non-starter we don't see the need to work with the oil and gas sector well if the oil and gas industry could help with the financing of the direct air capture why not team up with them we don't need them for direct air capture and quite frankly we don't want there to be an oil and gas industry in 40 50 years there will still be an oil industry in 50 years I have no doubt about that I think our company though will be a different company by 2050 that company is accidental petroleum and Vicki holb is CEO she wants to turn oxy into what she calls a carbon management company it is set aside more than a billion dollars to build what will be the world's largest direct air capture plant in Texas so this would represent the CO2 that's equivalent to taking 200,000 cars off the road holl showed us the Texas version of how CO2 would be sucked out of the air these are air of contact Towers some of the captured CO2 will be locked away underground just as we saw in Iceland some will still be used to extract more oil but h told us using carbon sucked out of the air means the new oil produced is what she calls carbon neutral that was hard to wrap our heads around but you'll be using carbon that you're capturing and taking out of the air to produce more oil that will then generate more carbon but the the oil will emit less carbon than the CO2 we've injected to get it so we've put more at at least the equivalent and sometimes more CO2 in the ground to get that oil then the oil will Adit when used holb told us producing oil this way is essential in the transition to a green economy Airlines and ships for example would need to run on fossil fuels until a sustainable alternative is found that could take years until then Hollow argues using CO2 to get that oil helps keep a lid on emissions your critics will say you can't trust an oil company talking about reducing CO2 that your mission here is T amount to greenwashing I would first say that we would never spend $1.2 billion for greenwashing so we've got a Monumental task ahead of us the way that the CO2 enhanced oil recovery process works is that we can reduce more out of the atmosphere than what um our products will emit when used and so if that's not a concept that people can get then we we will no we will not have a chance to achieve what we need to achieve HB told us she knows critics of big oil are suspicious and that many feel industry isn't moving fast enough to avoid a climate catastrophe on that point HB doesn't disagree she told us with the help of tax incentives ocidental plans to build 130 more direct air capture plants by 2035 we know how to make it happen we know how to drill the wells we know how to safely sequester it we were in Iceland and we were talking to some of the direct air capture companies and to be blunt they don't quite believe you we're going to walk the talk that's the only way that does it words will never convince anybody we need to get the direct air capture up and working we need to um make it better make it more economical and start having it developed all around the world the next decade will be critical if the direct air capture industry is to grow big enough to make an impact both carbfix and clim works told us they will be expanding to the US neither plans to work with the American oil industry the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable electric power has gone mainstream most visibly in the Auto industry the major car companies are chasing Tesla with ambitious plans for fleets of electric vehicles those cars and trucks run on lithium batteries the US has massive quantities of lithium but has been slow to invest in the mining and extraction of the metal that's about to change lithium operations powered by Clean energy are being developed in a long neglected impoverished part of California by the saltan Sea not far from the Mexican border the region is being called lithium Valley and just like the 1849 Gold Rush companies are racing to strike it rich east of s San Diego and south of Palm Springs lies the saltan sea California's largest inland body of water spreading East from the sea is a giant underground mineral-rich geothermal field boiling with pottassium sodium and lithium it is a worldclass lithium resource this is when you hear estimates of how big this resource could be it's usually measured on annual tons produced and we're confident that this is is a in excess of 300,000 tons a year right now that's way more than half of the world supply of lithium Eric sper is CEO of energy source minerals a company based by the salt and sea in California's Imperial Valley it's steaming ahead with plans to recover lithium using an existing Electric Plant powered by the vast underground geothermal field we're moving into an era of Green Technology especially with our cars where does this fit in our more conservative projection would support 7 and a half million electric vehicles a year which is half of the total US Car Sales or cars and trucks coming from the salt and sea area correct what about this plant this plant will be 20,000 tons per year which is equivalent to about 500,000 vehicles per year once up and running the tons of lithium generated here will be shipped refined and processed into millions of rechargeable electric car batteries over 50% of our lineup and our retail sales will be from Battery electric vehicles by the end of the decade Mark Stewart is head of stellantis North America a global car maker that owns some of America's Best Known Brands including Chrysler Jeep and Ram trucks it really is quote unquote the Industrial Revolution the next phase right this is the most interesting and exciting time to be a part of our industry stantis is investing $35 billion in an ambitious historic transformation we're reimagining our factories on our assembly plants they're already rolling our plug-in hybrids uh as well as looking to two new uh battery joint ventures uh that are in Full Construction right now the new Industrial Revolution it absolutely is it's really the the biggest technological changes in our industry in nearly 100 years we were down in the saltan sea region they believe they can supply the lithium needs for All American car manufactures absolutely that is the case whatever they can produce you guys will be buying it we for sure will take as much as we can get and as much as we have we have already secured early lithium is key to powering electric cars the dense metal helps make batteries rechargeable there's a lot of it around but extracting lithium is dirty business most comes from Rock mines in Australia or as powder evaporated from mineral ponds in South America the US has one lithium evaporation plant in Nevada Energy Source plans to break ground on a clean billion dooll facility here by the salt and sea in the next few months so the plant will fit in this spot right here correct that spot that's not a big that's not a big footprint no what are these we call them the mud pots and they are CO2 vents hot CO2 with fluid that's bubbling to the surface so this is evidence of the Heat and activity going on underground correct the 600° geothermal brine that powers the Region's electric plants comes from more than a mile beneath the Earth the boiling brine produces clean steam which drives turbines to generate enough electricity to power 4 100,000 homes in the past the mineral Rich brine was simply returned to the earth now energy source plans to extend the process and extract lithium from the brine before re-injecting it underground our process in combination with this resource will be the cleanest most efficient lithium process in the world and how long before the lithium processed here will be in commercial use in the US in 2025 a lot of the components that go into the batteries have been coming from um you know anywhere around the world but but America why was that we have a lot of um decent resources in North America they've just been undeveloped David Dee worked for for Tesla traveling the world to find the best sources of lithium as it was building up production of its electric vehicles or EVS Tesla turned to the lithium ion battery to power its cars the same kind of rechargeable battery Sony first mass produced for its cam quarters there was a new market for Consumer Electronics but the vast majority is for electric vehicles and that was pretty much triggered by Tesla triggered by Tesla also you know there's lot of Eevee growth uh and Eevee demand and production in in China that's been a big part of uh big part of the global lithium demand Story come on in deak is now energy sources Chief development officer and says he had a Eureka moment when he saw its unique technology at the company's lab deak showed us the mechanics in miniature the full-size plant will be 100 times larger so what goes on inside this cylinder is it pellets or what what is the The Matrix yeah I think of it as beads in a in a column much like the activated carbon that you would find in a BRI filter it works in a in a similar concept a br filter will filter all impurities out of water mhm this absorbent is something that would only take in lithium and not absorb everything else the system takes just a few hours to turn this orange brine into this clear lithium solution which will be dried into powder and this is what everybody's looking for that's what everyone wants here by the salt and sea energy source is leading the race for lithium Warren Buffett's bhe Renewables runs 10 geothermal power plants in the region and there's another on the drawing board by an Australian company controlled thermal resources both Ventures are moving to tap the promise bubbling under the Earth CEO Rod cwell told us controlled thermal resources had been fine-tuning the process at this test facility for 90 days we're producing lithium from live Brian here behind us this is our optimization plant based on what it learns here controlled thermal resources plans to build a new plant for recovering lithium which costs about $4,000 a ton to extract and currently is selling for six times more the noise is from the machine cooling 600° brine rising from the well releasing Steam and this is a battery grade product from suan C BR this for you is Eureka this is absolutely R yes Rod cwell told us this bottle of clear lithium chloride is the purest product from this test facility so far this is the first time this has been in my hands this happened last night Bill s I might take that home with me that's about $10 worth of lithium right there so you know it works we know it works the question here in the salt and sea Basin is will it work for everyone this Rich lithium resource Lies Beneath one of the poorest sections of California the saltan sea was created when the Colorado River flooded the Basin in 1905 but for the past 50 years the main source of water has been chemical Laden agricultural runoff and for decades now the sea has been evaporating and shrinking a once thriving tourist industry has been replaced by environmental Decay toxic dust and economic hardship and with unemployment in the region hovering around 16% there's a lot riding on turning the Imperial Valley into lithium Valley Governor nusum call it you know the Saudi Arabia of lithium I think you know it can change landscape of the region Frank Ruiz the Autobon society's local program director is fighting to include the community in that change he was a commissioner on the state panel studying how the entire region can benefit from the potential underground you're an environmentalist how do you reconcile the industrialization of this area with saving the wildlife and the communities we need to learn how to balance the tables the Le industry can be really good you know for these communities it can you know it can provide better pay jobs it can provide more job opportunities especially for the younger folks it can provide the revenues you know to offset the challenges that we have here at the Salton Sea geologists predict once the industry is fully operational the lithium underground should last for Generations before running out good news for stellantis which ran out of batteries for its plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler last year we sold out what happened the you know if uh if I could turn back my crystal ball bill I would have secured a little more capacity for for last year to prevent that from happening in the future Mark Stewart and stellantis have committed to buying lithium from controlled thermal resources at the salt and sea knowing it will be years before its product is commercially viable we secured a large Supply from them over a 10-year period uh because we are very positive on their technology so is car maker General Motors which has invested in controlled thermal resources the department of energy and US automakers are eager for domestic lithium the companies were stung when the pandemic disrupted the worldwide supply chain stalling shipments of microchips Parts and batteries still today 3/4 of all lithium batteries are are processed in Asia current lithium what typically happens right it's mined in one spot it's moved across the world for processing and comes back think of all that additional cost think of all that additional carbon that's being used to do that and at the end someone pays for it and that's a consumer so will having this domestic supply of lithium help keep the cost of electric vehicles down it will certainly help prices for electric cars are coming down and are projected to be on par with gas vehicles within a few years driven in part by the tax incentives in the 2022 inflation reduction act Eric sper of energy source told us the tax benefits have also been a catalyst for developing domestic lithium we're starting to see big announcements of Investments to create that domestic demand so it doesn't ever have to go across an ocean this seems like this is a GameChanger for American industry it's a competitive Advantage it's an opportunity that we can be a leader globally and why not lead when hurricane Doran slammed into the northern Bahamas in 2019 the category 5 storm caused nearly inestimable damage on a number of islands there's a growing consensus among scientists that climate change is making hurricane stronger and more destructive that's very bad news for the Bahamas a string of more than 700 low-lying Islands stretching from Florida nearly down to Cuba in the heart of what's come to be known as Hurricane Alley when we visited in late 2019 hurricane recovery was really just beginning but we discovered that the Bahamas had found a ray of Hope specific speically a solar array that can survive future hurricanes and in the process it may have important lessons for the rest of the world with sustained winds of 185 mph gusts above 200 and a storm surge well over 20 ft in some spots please pray for us hurricane Duan W unimaginable havoc on the Bahamian Islands known as the abacos there's not enough words in the dictionary to describe what H toown look like after this hope toown has been Vernon Malone's home for all of his 82 years his family has lived here since 1785 he's the town Baker and grosser and he and his wife rode out the storm in his store it survived but their home just up the street did not the entrance went right in there Vernon's son Brian had a home just around the corner had a home that pile of rubble we see there that's actually two and a half houses mine's on the bottom hope toown is a Bahamian Landmark its candy striped Lighthouse dates to 1863 and is pictured on the country's $10 bill the lighthouse stood up to Dorian but as we saw coming into the harbor not much else did I hear generators everywhere is this how you guys are getting through yep yep Brian Malone and Matt Winslow an American who owns a vacation home on the island told us why all those generators are still running the substation in Marsh Harbor which feeds us the power is destroyed and then of course you can see all the utility poles are pretty much destroyed so this isn't a case where you you come in and replace some poles and you flick a switch this is months and months and months of of work hop toown is on one of several small Islands ravaged by Dorian which then moved across 7 miles of Open Water to Marsh Harbor the largest town in the abacast at least 60 people died in Marsh Harbor and destruction is still everywhere total damage and loss from Dorian is estimated at $3.4 billion when you see the extend of the destruction where do you even begin how do you even begin that's always the question Where Do We Begin the Bahamian prime minister at the time Hubert M and his Aid Viana Gardner visited Marsh Harbor with us and pointed to a top priority restoring electric power how do you bring this back the power we had to make determination to set up um micro grids the micro grids prime minister min is talking about are small scale systems more and more they are solar arrays with battery storage for when the sun's not shining they can either feed electricity into the larger Grid or operate independently to power a single facility or a neighborhood the way electricity has been produced in the Bahamas is with diesel fuel generating stations on each inhabited Island about 30 in all feeding power to everyone through over headlines the main power plant for this island is literally 25 Mi south of here that's 25 Mi a line that has to be rebuilt Chris Burgess and Justin lock run the islands energy program for an American nonprofit called the Rocky Mountain Institute they have solar projects throughout Hurricane Alley after Category 5 Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017 they put micro grids on the roofs of 10 schools Maria also brushed St Vincent this is its first micro grid now the islands energy program has come to Marsh Harbor so how big will this solar array be 15 Acres right through here that micro grid will satisfy 10% of marsh Harbor's total power needs and will be built right between its government center and Hospital both were without power for weeks after Dorian this is high ground which makes it less vulnerable to storm surge and other types of disaster events so if uh a storm like Dorian hits again the power to these two critical facilities stays on corre the push to build stormproof solar micro grids in the Bahamas began in 2017 after Hurricane Irma another category 5 storm tore through tiny ragged Island at the southern tip of the island chain after raged Island was devastated I made a statement let us show the world what can be done we may be small but we can set an example to the world so it's your your goal to make ragged Island a Green Island absolutely absolutely after which we can expand it we can expand it to see the prime minister's green experiment we flew to ragged Island with Whitney Hasty CEO of government-owned utility Bahamas Power and Light engineer Burlington STW met us there and took us to what he calls the very first hurricane proof solar micro grid being installed in the Bahamas unlike other solar designs it's very low to the ground so this installation is rated to withstand 1880 M hour winds which is an even harder punch than Irma landed back in 2017 there was significant Devastation on this island as you can see some of the poles snapped right at the very base of the PO snapped right at the base is that what happened all over the island that happened throughout the island this micro grid will produce enough electricity for ragged Islands roughly 100 residents the Prime Minister calls it a laboratory for the solar future the past is a diesel generator needing boats to deliver fuel from hundreds of miles away a system Whitney Hasty says is a nightmare you know in summer we're almost on the verge of running out of fuel in some of these islands because bad weather sometimes prohibits the ships from actually getting to some of these location the Bahamian government spends nearly $400 million a year on imported fuel to keep its power plants running and passes that cost along to its citizens they pay three to four times what we pay on the mainland us right for electricity here right and that isn't price gouging I mean that's that's just inherent cost everything costs more in the islands the bill to install this new solar micro grid is $3 million Hasty insists it's money well spent so you have this initial big outlay to build these panels but over time the cost of generating power actually goes down absolutely absolutely by using what God has blessed us with which is the natural sun it's not a perfect solution on ragged Island notably the power from these panels will still feed into the vulnerable overhead power lines the money's not there yet to bury them one of the first things that I think everyone can agree on is everything has to go underground back in hopetown Matt Winslow says they have the funds to bury their lines Americans with second homes here add a lot to the economy winds Family Foundation has donated nearly a million dollars to rebuilding efforts they already have a makeshift micr grid powering the fire station and health clinic and Winslow has hired Engineers to help plan a much bigger one on a nearby Island it's possible that over in great we could put uh you know a solar array 18 acres and that goes uh that power is piped through you know preferably a new undersea cable to the island and that could be a main source of our power that would be enough to power this island absolutely the Bahama's goal is to produce 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 Justin lock and Chris Burgess of the islands energy program believe the country can do even better the price of Renewables have come down to the point where they're now very very competitive with diesel and in most cases um way cheaper than diesel the key game Cher has been battery storage battery storage has decreased in cost over 60% over the last 5 years and what battery storage does is it enables the sun to shine when the sun is not shining Renewables make more sense here than anywhere else in the world and in the Caribbean micro grids are starting to show their value when earthquakes struck Puerto Rico in 2020 the entire Island's big electric grid was shut down for days but remember those solar micro grids installed at schools they kept providing power the lessons can really apply anywhere California has the same system architecture as here in the Caribbean right fossil fuel long transmission distribution lines right and you see that pg& had to proactively shut off power to millions of people in order to prevent fire if there had been these micro grids might it have been that pg& would not have had to cut off power to correct millions of consumers correct here in the Bahamas there are still huge economic obstacles losses from Dorian equal nearly 30% of the country's entire annual GDP we've got this incredible outlay to rebuild these islands that were devastated by Dorian can you afford to bring on a new form of electrical generation we cannot afford it we recognize from one that we cannot do it alone just weeks after Dorian hit then prime minister minis spoke at the United Nations he emphasized that most of the Bahamas was not damaged and eager for tourists lifeblood of the economy then he said that First World countries and their pollution are at least partly to blame for the threat of ever stronger hurricanes it is a threat which we cannot survive on our own first world Nations and this what I said at the UN I said first world Nations make the greatest contribution to climate change they are the ones responsible for the changes that we see the increase in velocity and ferocity of the hurricanes and the different and the changes typhoons that we see today but we're the innocent victim we the ones that are being impacted by what you've created Min and leaders of other Islands Nations have proposed that the US and European countries contribute to an insurance fund think of it as a really rainy day fund to help rebuild from future storms that's what you say and what you said at the UN the first world Nations should do absolutely are they doing it it's an ongoing discussion it's an ongoing discussion does this make the change to renewable energy that much more important imperative urgent for you here in the Bahamas it is because even though our contribution to climate change is minimal it's Min it's minuscule to compare with for is RO Nation but we still have our responsibility since this story first aired in 2020 that micro grid we saw being installed on ragged island is now operating and supplying all all the electricity the island needs they haven't had to ship diesel fuel to run that old Generator in many months which is especially welcome news given that the price of fuel has skyrocketed the Bahamas has a new government and new prime minister who says he's just as committed to solar power as his predecessor last August president President Biden signed a sweeping climate bill in the law making wind power a priority specifically offshore wind power the goal is to capture the force of the wind in the Open Seas and convert it into power for 10 million American homes by 2030 we have a long way to go there are only seven offshore wind turbines off the coast of the United States compared to nearly 6,000 in Europe critics say they're expensive to build and maintain unpredictable and ugly we wanted to see for ourselves last October we reported from the largest offshore wind farm in the world along the northeast coast of England and discovered the power of Grimsby as you fly 200 mil north of London along the coast you can see the town of Grimsby below 55 mil east of her Port morning we are on our way to the horns wind Park fil crew on board you can't miss them elegant and a little Eerie white Giants poking out of the North Sea like something out of a science fiction novel wind par with 6 this is the largest crop of offshore wind turbines in the world known as the hornsey wind farm it is hypnotizing more than 300 turbines spread across 335 square miles generating enough electricity to help power more than 2 million homes a day beautiful day yeah beautiful day to understand the power size and upkeep of this evolving technology we geared up on land and traveled 90 minutes on the heaving North Sea with 24-year-old briy salmon her job is to scale and service the turbines my job with the help of a little anti nausea gum was to Simply hold down my lunch this is choppy out here yeah it is how you feeling I feel um okay it's more important how do you feel yeah I'm feeling good like I said I like to think I've got my sea legs on so when your last name is salmon negotiating Rough Waters is sort of in your DNA Bri's great-grandfather worked on the grimby dogs her dad owns this 100-year-old smoked fish shop in town briy was bartending when she decided to apply to an apprentice program to be a Turbine Technician she was one of seven people selected from a pool of 500 should have a look around here then guys The Apprentice program combined classroom instruction you've got a big drillet on the bottom and it's and it's spinning with hands on work could seat but we soon learned that mother nature is a temperamental teacher the weather here is Ever Changing yeah yeah we're holding on for our dear lives yeah I mean I mean it's the North Sea it's not something we can control so every day is different and it can change like that so it's just part and parcel of the job um anything to get these things turning this is the environment for win turbines it's it's got to be windy as we approached the turbines we suddenly felt small you don't get a sense of how large things are until you're right up under this yeah well that's it I mean so at the very top the this cell um all the way to the top of the blades is half the size of the Eiffel Tower which is pretty massive and and because you've got nothing normal to compare it to like a building you just see these in the distance and then you're here and it's yeah they're pretty bloody huge translation they're nearly 600 ft high with spinning fiberglass blades roughly the length of the world's largest passenger jet each blade weighs almost 30 tons the turbines are partially assembled on Shore then shipped out to sea where each blade is attached with surgical Precision to the top of the turbine every angle has to be perfect to generate maximum power once installed keeping them spinning is critical offshore wind Engineers say one revolution can power one home in the UK for 24 hours and that's where bridey comes in it's raining it's windy yep can't wait just another day in the office all right in choppy Waters Captain Peter browon has to find The Sweet Spot maintaining Constant Contact between the bow and base traffic seem liance some days the winds are so high and seas so rough the job can't be done done on this day success right I'll see you later okay careful briy harnesses herself to a cable happy you yeah leaps to a ladder and Begins the climb rung by rung eight stories to the top see wind alliance1 radio Che on a narrow platform hanging over the North Sea she makes her rounds the lights are working carefully inspecting and servicing the turbine a job not for the faint of heart pop this in here what was that like the first time you made that car oh exhausting exhausting yeah it was cuz you've got all your safety kit on as well so you've probably got about 10 kg of harnesses and and Claws and you got to be clipped in so you've got that friction of climbing I would imagine it would be kind of scary yeah really scary I remember there was one day it was super windy um so we were up there in the top of the town Tower is moving so you've got the seasickness the motion sickness from the sea and then the top of the tower is moving so all day you're rocking and it was cold and windy and I remember coming back on Shore I was just rocking I I'm on land now I don't need to rock but it's yeah it's pretty scary bench Sykes says those kinds of extraordinary efforts are needed in extraordinary times Sykes is the vice president of offshore wind at orad a Danish based Global energy supplier that runs the horn SE Wind Farm you know we have a cost of energy crisis in Europe and and in Britain at the moment that's driven by the pandemic but also of course by the terrible situation in Ukraine uh and all of that adds up to a real drive to find clean cheap Energy Solutions about six years ago orad decided to sell off its oil and gas business and focus on renewable energies Grimsby a depressed fishing Town became the unlikely backdrop to Europe's clean energy movement why here why Grimsby it's got a good Port uh and it's geographically really well located physically in terms of the water depth in terms of the wind resource and of course places to connect to the National Grid so that we can get that power to homes and businesses long before Russia's invasion of Ukraine set off the energy crisis the UK had a strategy to use 100% clean or renewable electricity by 2035 when you talk about clean energy you talk about solar hydropower biofuels what makes offshore wind unique offshore wind is the really the only project in most countries where you can build it at the kind of power station scale that we need if I think about the projects we're building here in the UK that's almost 3 GW and that's broadly speaking the output of a nuclear power station so we're talking large scale infrastructure projects most of Europe is too populated to fit very very very large wind farms or solar Farms so that's why we've gone offshore one big criticism is costs they're expensive to construct to transmit into decommission is that cost passed on to Consumers so that's simply wrong offshore wind power is one of the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the UK we privately fund it together with Investment Partners that we bring in privately you fund that yeah there's no public exposure to the costs of building offshore wind and I think the thing that's made the most difference is the fact that we've had political consensus now for more than a decade and that's given investors confidence to step in and put the big money on the table to get these projects away gas and nuclear still make up a majority of the power supply flowing into UK homes and businesses but this year 14% of Britain's energy has come from offshore wind only China produces more offshore wind power than the UK here here's how it works wind turns the blades around a shaft inside the turbine which bends a generator energy then travels down going 300 ft beneath the water surface to cables buried under the seabed connecting to an offshore substation then to a power station on land where that electricity created out at Sea is transferred into homes and businesses inviting the question what happens if the wind stops blowing using satellites and other technology we can predict extremely accurately how much we're going to generate over the next days which enables those who operate the grid to make very clear plans about where's demand going where's Supply going I mean if I look at the turbines that we've got out in hornsey they're operating 98 99% of the time this is grimsby's second act through the 1950s to 1970 the town hosted the largest fishing Fleet in the world with 700 trollers a wash in cash and a port fit for a visit from the queen oh it was absolutely brilliant the the camarad here because you you can say nearly 100% of the population would be associated with the fishing industry in some way Dennis Avery and Bob forby were part of the town's fishing tradition what was it like no it's a tough job it's work from sailing till you get back in the port again working in the winter around Iceland and them places was was pretty severe but um it's a kind of job that I would do again tomorrow in those days you had two choices you worked on the docks or you went to sea Deca Navigator Avery Captain this hulking steel fishing tler the Ross tiger for 8 years if you caught a good trip and you're steaming home back to Grimsby with a fish room full of fish you know it it's a marvelous feeling that Marvel marous feeling ended when Iceland Britain's neighbor to the north began enforcing fishing restrictions in their codr Waters to Grimsby May shrink to a trickle what did you see happen in town when that happened gosh it was a a disaster to be quite honest because everybody was involved some way in fishing like taxi drivers the pubs the dress shops and places like that uh they all suffered you know once the fishing sort of went it all sort of died to death wind power has breathed new life into Grimsby offshore Energy company orad says it's created 600 jobs here and invested over $18 billion in local wind farms but there are plenty of people who worry the environmental impact of the wind turbines hasn't been sufficiently studied and others say the industry has not created the number of jobs they've promised but the concern of these retired fishermen is more practical we're not seeing benefits your electricity bill hasn't gone down no no it's gone up if anything when they said about them how oh we're going to get cheap electricity and it's going to be you know green and everything but I can't see any benefits to be quite honest but has your electricity bill gone down try double it's doubled there are people who said yeah we've got all these turbines but our electricity bill hasn't gone down a cent yeah um I mean it is a real challenge that it's going to take time because we need to build more offshore wind so you think if there's more offshore wind prices could go down yeah absolutely fearing the war in Ukraine could lead to blackouts last winter the UK government announced more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea they will also speed up the time it takes for new offshore wind projects to get online Ben Sykes told us that over the next eight years ored plans to invest another $17 billion in wind farms and add more than 300 jobs in Grimsby you know the fishing industry was fantastic for Grimsby that that era has passed what we want to do is to be part of creating the next chapter of of grimsby's life and of the country's Life as we build out a chapter bridey salmon is very much a part of so that's gone from Grimsby being the fishing town to the PowerHouse of the north which is an amazing transition proud of it so proud of it and to be a part of it it's amazing a Town's future and Fortune once again tied to the Sea representatives from nearly every nation have met this week at an annual climate Summit searching for agreements on how to curb the rise of global temperatures the Summit is being held in the oil Rich United Arab Emirates and that has dismayed activists who believe that the only way to really address the climate crisis is to walk away from fossil fuels for the moment at least the world and the United States need both fossil fuels and renewable energy and the best proof of that may be found in the state of Wyoming it is the country's leading coal producing state and very conservative politically yet its Republican Governor Mark Gordon is emerging as a leading voice promoting climate friendly energy projects and action to address the climate crisis essentially Mark Gordon is trying to prove that it is possible to be both red and green we needed to be aggressive and we needed to really address this issue so you tell the people of Wyoming that climate change is real I do and that it's urgent it's an urgent crisis I have said that and I've gotten I've gotten some push back from that as well I bet you have in September we met Mark Gordon who's in the middle of his second term as Wyoming's Governor how are you Ellington on the cattle ranch where he grew up this is my dad's old saddle his family still owns this Ranch and he and his wife also operate another about 40 Mi away how did growing up here affect your world view I think growing up here gave me an enormous appreciation for the world around us and and the ecological processes and the weather you just are uh exposed to it on a regular on a regular basis Mark Gordon is also a mountain climber who has seen glaciers receding due to a warming climate he says that helped convince him to set a goal of making Wyoming not just carbon neutral when it comes to CO2 emissions but eventually carbon negative you first made this pledge of net negative CO2 emissions at a 2021 State of the State speech how did that go over I think some people probably resented it I think generally it's been well respected uh it was to to some degree a bold move and and one that was intended to make a difference in that discussion about energy in the future after Gordon repeated his net negative emissions goal at an appearance at Harvard in October Wyoming's Republican party passed a vote of no confidence in him but he says heat from the right won't deter him from pursuing what he calls an all of the above energy policy whatever you're going to do in energy probably you're going to have something to do in Wyoming we have tremendous wind resources we have the largest reserves of uranium important for nuclear energy largest coal producer we're number eight in oil number nine in natural gas 83% of our energy is exported that will soon include nuclear power from a Next Generation reactor to be built in Wyoming with a $500 million investment from Bill Gates huge wind farms already dot Wyoming's landscape with the biggest one yet on the way because the wind blows basically 247 365 days a year Bill Miller is president president of the power company of Wyoming which is beginning to build what will be the largest wind farm in the continental United States in the middle of a geographic break in the Continental Divide all the winds which blow from west to east pretty much are funneled through this part of the country Miller drove to the top of a place called Choke Cherry knob to give us a taste of the wind so when this is up and running how many turbin will be out here current plan calls for 600 turbin and how much energy will that generate so it'll generate around 12 million megawatt hours of power year and that's enough to power how many homes million million two Wyoming doesn't have anything close to that many homes it has the smallest population of any of the 50 states So the plan is to build a new 800m long transmission line to send that power to California which needs and wants it what's this going to cost the wind farm will be something north of $5 billion transmission line will be something north of $3 billion capital investment that's a big investment yes the project is bankrolled by billionaire Philip anshutz who owns the company Bill Miller runs and who first made his fortune in oil Society has spoken that's what this country is going to go to is renewable energy more importantly it's a project that contributes to the zero carbon initiatives that we strongly believe in it's going to happen and this is the best place for it to happen at this past Summer's windy groundbreaking ceremony for the transmission line Bill Miller was joined not just by Republican Governor Mark Gordon we have a great future ahead of us but also by two members of President Biden's cabinet the way we've tried to navigate this is to find something for everyone and I think that's that possible yeah I think it is honestly I think if people are going to embrace how we get to a carbon neutral carbon negative future it has to be by saying we're all going to be a little bit better by embracing Innovation if a single single picture can capture Wyoming's energy past present and future this may be it a fully loaded coal train passing in front of a huge Wind Farm remember this state still produces more coal than any other by far the likelihood that we will truly as a world move away from fossil fuels is very low Holly kutka runs the school of energy resources at the University of Wyoming before shifting to Academia she worked worked for Peabody the largest coal company in America 82% of our Global energy consumption is fossil fuels 82% 82% it has not changed because of that Stark fact kutka and her colleagues are focused on taking the CO2 out of fossil fuels like coal before it reaches the atmosphere with a technology called carbon capture and storage there are carbon capture and storage projects in America America working right now there's just not enough the capture side we're there today we can do it now right now yes the technology is there but is it economically feasible it will always be cheaper to do nothing than to add carbon capture and storage if you want to reduce emissions this is part of the solution we have to decide is it worth the cost at the huge dryfork Coal Fired power plant near Gillette the University of Wyoming is operating what it calls the integrated test center some of the flu gas that would otherwise go up the Smoke Stack is siphoned off into Labs like this one where the Japanese company Kawasaki is testing methods for making carbon capture more economical Wells 10,000 ft deep have also been drilled to show that captured CO2 can be stored underground forever how big a deal would it be to find an affordable way to capture carbon at the point of admission say in power plants around the world it would be a game Cher for certain you know there are a lot of naysayers who say that this is a pipe dream mhm it'll never happen what do you say to them how do you convince them I say we're trying it then I know people will say well you're just trying to extend the life of the coal mines I am but I'm also trying to do that in a way that is going to do more for climate Solutions than simply standing up a whole bunch of wind fors or sending up a whole bunch of solarist with his all of the above approach Mark Gordon is trying to put every kind of energy project on a fast track including Bill Miller's huge Wind Farm how long did you think it was going to take when you started when I originally started I thought we could probably get this entitled and under construction within 5 years and it's been 17 17 why so long primarily the permitting process the bureaucracy of the federal government you told me coming up here that the the process was kind of like a nightmare it was difficult maybe nightmar is a little bit too strong but uh it was very difficult process so how important is it to reduce Regulatory and permitting barriers I think it's massive permitting reform I think is one of our biggest challenges at a federal level it is something that's being embraced uh by both sides both the Biden Administration and Congressional Republicans have endorsed the idea of streamlining permitting for energy projects actually doing it is another story in Wyoming Governor Gordon has done what he can one thing I can share is that it's a state that's very welcoming to innovators in the energy space cly caves is co-founder of a company called cruso Energy Systems about 5 years ago it decided to tackle the problem of flaring when gas produced at oil wells is simply burned into the atmosphere if you could capture it all it would power about 2/3 of Europe's electricity it's a very large amount of waste and we're just burning it off we're burning it off because there's no pipeline there cavis and his colleagues came up with the unconventional idea of putting a small electricity generating power plant right where that gas was being flared and wasted what we do is we tap into that gas line we bring the gas over to a power generation system and then that generates electricity and we take that electricity directly into our on-site data center to power hundreds or thousands of computers and then we Network the computers to the outside world with fiber or satellite internet to get it off site so you take a Data Center and just basically put it on top of the well head exactly it's a it's a modern data center in every way when you're standing inside of it and then you step out the door and you're in an oil field cruso energy first used those electricity gobbling data centers to mine Bitcoin now most of that computer power is being used by artificial intelligence companies the first place to let them try this in 2018 was Wyoming that's not necessarily an idea that everyone's going to embrace automatically right off the bat before it's been done before Wyoming was they invited us to come do it for the first time here we did it at a small scale we proved that it could work and that helped us attract the funding and the other projects that have helped us scale to where we are today how many of these um Centers do you have up and running currently we're approaching 200 by the end of the year we'll have about 200 of our modular data centers deployed throughout the United States and now internationally so how do you assess your environmental impact So today we're operating at a scale of more than 20 million cubic feet of gas per day that would have otherwise been flared and wasted we're preventing that flaring it's on the order of several hundred thousand cars per year being taken off the road in terms of the avoided emissions impact are you trying to send out a message to the rest of the country even the rest of the world if you have a renewable or a climate friendly idea bring it here bring it to Wyoming love to we we want to be part of this solution there are some really remarkable things that if we stop talking about what we shouldn't do and start talking about what we can do and how we can Embrace that future that's what we're dedicated to here in Wyoming there was a time when futurists were predicting that the Advent of 3D printing was going to change our lives that each of our houses would have a 3D printer to make whatever items we need what virtually no one predicted though was that there might soon be 3D printers that could construct almost the entire house but that's just what a six-year-old Austin Texas company called icon is doing 3D printing buildings and if you believe icon's mission-driven young founder 3D printing could revolutionize how we build help create affordable housing even allow us to wait for it colonize the moon sound out of this world take a look what you're watching is the building actually the printing of a four-bedroom home on this construction site there's no hammering or sawing just a nozzle squirting out concrete kind of like an oversized soft serve ice cream dispenser laying down the walls of a house one layer at a time it's the brainchild of a 41-year-old Texan who's rarely without his cowboy hat Jason Ballard 3D printing a house yes ma'am people are going to hear that and say no we're sitting inside one right now this house was printed yes ma'am wow there you are look at this welcome and so was this one does a concrete home printed by a robot have to look cold and Industrial maybe not I like the curved wall Ballard gave us a peek at the first completed model home and what will soon be the world's first large community of 3D printed houses a hundred of them part of a huge new development north of Austin they'll start in the high $400,000 range how exactly does 3D printing a house Work Well it starts with this 1 and 1/2 ton sack of dry concrete powder which gets mixed with water sand and additives and is then pumped to the robotic printer now you are looking at how we control the beat size Connor Jenkins icon's manager of construction here explain that the printer completes one layer called a bead every 30 minutes by which time it's hardened enough to be ready for the next beat steel is added every 10th layer for strength the amount of change you're making is Tiny it takes about 2 weeks to print the full 160 beat house Jenkins gave me the controls an iPad so look Leslie that's a little skinny will you press the plus one real quick aren you wor you just increased the bead size incrementally I'd be worried if I were you but turns out the path is entirely preprogrammed I couldn't mess it up if I tried don't tell the I think that's the most gorgeous beat I've ever seen I think this will be the highest selling house for now as Jason Ballard showed us icon is only 3D printing walls with cutouts for plumbing and electricity roofs windows and insulation are added the old-fashioned way by construction workers he calls it a paradigm shift it really is like a r Brothers moment for airplanes in how we construct our housing but why do we need a big shift like that cuz right now it is too expensive it falls over in a hurricane it burns up in a fire it gets eaten by termites the way you try to make it affordable is you trim quality on materials you trim quality on labor the result is these cookie cutter developments and like yeah this is not the world like we are not succeeding it's something we have to get right on top of that it's an ecological disaster and I would certainly say it is existentially urgent that we shelter ourselves without ruining the planet we have to live on fire resistant flood resistant wind Ballard showed us a sample of a 3D printed wall beside a conventionally built one you say it's faster more efficient yes why do you say that what you've got let's count the materials siding one moisture barrier two sheathing three uh stud four drywall five and then float tape and texture you can count that either as one or three but you've got at Le at least half a dozen novel steps that have to take place to deliver an American stick frame wall system by comparison we need a single material supply chain delivered by a robot let's talk about waste yes ma'am over here at the end of constructing a home with these materials there are truckloads and truckloads of waste left over these studs are going to have off cuts that go into a waste pile same with siding same with drial all whereas with 3D printing he says you only print what you need so in short like if an alien came down to planet Earth and saw these two ways of building and said from first principles which is better the alien would go Stronger Faster termite resistant fire resistant like by a mile this is the best way to build though old school construction workers May disagree if Ballard sounds a little like a revved up salesman or a preacher there's a reason for that he grew up in East Texas a studious outdoorsy spiritual kid first in his family to graduate from college you were thinking about becoming an Episcopal priest yeah I was almost an Episcopal priest but along the way I started just like getting this like itch about housing not being right so I studied conservation biology I got involved in Sustainable Building and I worked at the local homeless shelter and so now I'm thinking about homelessness and I'm working in Sustainable Building along the way my hometown gets destroyed by a hurricane and I have to go help my family pull drywall out of their house I feel like uh life is just putting housing in front of me right as I've been like approved to go to Seminary and so I go to my Bishop the bishop of Texas Andy Doyle he's still the bishop of Texas and uh I said what do I do and at the end he said Jason I want you to pursue this housing thing like this is your priesthood this is your vocation and if it doesn't work out the church has been here for a long time we'll still be here but that must have turned the switch for you it did it made it more than a hobby or a business right that it sort of became a mission he began began pursuing that mission with Evan Lumis a buddy from Texas A&M who had gone into Finance as we looked at it like nobody had Incorporated kind of the Holy Trinity of innovation to housing which was robotics Advanced Materials and software so in a borrowed Warehouse on nights and weekends and having read everything they could find about the mechanics of 3D printing they tried to design a 3D printer that could make a building how big was it it was 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet so it would have it would have printed if we had ever gotten into work which we did not uh it would have printed like a 100t like demonstration building they didn't get it to work but enter Alex Laro a recent Bor Engineering Graduate who was tinkering with a similar idea did you ever actually build anything yeah I did what was it a printed shed the shed doesn't sound too cool but it was a big milestone it's a real structure the three co-founded icon in 2017 and soon got funding to print a small house to unveil at Austin South by Southwest Festival the following spring they built a new larger printer that worked and we got really excited okay Jason where are we right now we are printing the world's uh first permitted 3D printed house but the Kinks hadn't quite been worked out so at one point we ran the printer into the print to explain that supposed to go up and it went down and then drove into the house like pushed a bunch of layers off funny now but not so much at the time some Engineers folks who were like helping us sat us down and said guys it's been a great effort but you're not going to get there so like why don't you guys get some rest and we were basically like get out of here like true anyone who wants to to finish this home may stay everyone else needs to leave and the three of you all agreed on that yeah we knew that we were to something and like we this was like our shot and we weren't going to miss it Alex they worked around the clock and made the festival deadline by just hours hey valard any words for the victory lot never never never never give up I stand by those words yeah sure never give up he showed us the 350 square ft finished house it's a small little house but it's kind of elegant well I'll be that's not so bad I mean I think that's kind of how people felt about it like better than they expected and it was easy to believe well they'll get better that small little house won icon a lot of attention an innovation award investors meetings with the military and with another Austin innovator Alan Graham who created a village called Community First that provides small homes to several hundred of the formally homeless our goal was really the most despised Outcast lost and forgotten of our community wow average time on the streets is 9 years average age of death is 59 it's an absolute Miracle out there and so when uh we were ready to start building homes uh one of the first organizations we reached out to was Alan Graham so icon 3D printed a welcome center and then six small houses for Village residents that's 73-year-old Tim Shay who battled heroin addiction for decades in 2020 became the first person in this country to live in a 3D printed home before I saw these houses in my mind I thought it must be cold you're shaking cuz you don't think that no just the opposite you feel embraced or you know enveloped people that live that are in the economic Strat of the men and women that we serve are going to be the last people on the planet that are going to benefit out of new technology and he wanted to make sure that they were the first the first person in North America to live in a 3D printed house was homeless yeah I isn't that s the years since have seen tremendous growth for Icon a new Factory to build more printers and improve the quality of its concrete and a facility called printland to experiment with new designs icon has printed small homes in rural Mexico vehicle hide structures for the Marine Corps huge Barracks for the Army and Air Force and a deluxe showcase home featuring wavy walls and curves that would be prohibitively expensive if built traditionally but not when programmed into a 3D printer so in your minds is your C customer a homeless person or is your customer me there's a trick here because what our heart wants to do is to serve the very poor and it's often been like confusing for people to understand it's like I thought you guys were helping homelessness why are you building that fancy house yeah I would resign if I was only allowed to build luxury homes and we would go bankrupt right now if all we built was 3% margin homes for homeless people but once this technology arrives in its full force um I think it fundamentally transforms the way we build and not just on the earth 3D printing on the moon when we come back it has been a staple of Science Fiction forever humans living and working on the moon but for NASA that dream is almost within reach there their new Artemis program plans to return American astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years this time not just to visit but eventually to stay and even use the moon as a base for exploring Mars and Beyond but staying on the moon requires infrastructure landing pads roads housing and you can't exactly bring 2x4s and sheetrock on a spacecraft that's with 3D printing comes in NASA is partnering with Jason Ballard's company icon to Pioneer 3D printing on the moon 3 2 1 and liftoff of emis 1 last fall NASA launched the first in a series of Artemis missions the next with crew on board is scheduled for next fall and by the end of the decade an icon printer is supposed to fly to the moon to test print part of a landing pad Jason Ballard who once applied to be an astronaut but was rejected can't wait if the schedule holds or even approximately holds the first object ever built on another world will be built with icon Hardware he wants icon to be the first company to make something on another world so do we at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville Alabama NASA scientists Jennifer Edmonson and corki Clinton run a program called impact spelled mm P Moon toor's planetary autonomous Construction Technologies whoa you people at Nasa you come up with these very very long names that's why we call it impact the key word there is autonomous we want to be able to make structures that we need without having to be tended by astronauts if you're going to have a truly sustainable presence on the lunar surface you have to be as Earth independent as possible NASA was interested in 3D printing having looked at an early version almost 20 years ago so when they heard about the progress icon had made with their first houses in Austin Corky Clinton traveled there to take a look being an engineer I spent a lot of my time going around and looking at the size of the beads and how they went around the corners and I'll tell you I was really impressed with what they had accomplished impressed enough that NASA gave icon development money in 2020 and then last fall a $57 million contract welcome to space lab lesle this is where we figure out how to build on other worlds Ballard and Evan Jensen who leads the project explained the fundamental challenge to bring an object roughly this size from Earth to the Moon surface would be $1 million and think of how many sort of brick-sized things we would need to do Launchpad Landing Pad roads habitats so we have to learn to live off the land you have to learn to build it there and use the materials from there that's right but that's no easy feet it means using what's called lunar regolith which covers the moon's surface rather than concrete and water as a building material regolith is made up of rock that has been pummeled over billions of years from asteroids comets and things is it like sand it's actually finer than sand icon has a big tub full of simulated Moon regolith and they have invented and built a robotic system to 3D print with it you're going to build all those roads and buildings out of this that's correct to the robots will this is actually the mission that we are scheduled to fly as he pointed out in this rendering our robotic arm with our laser system they've created a whole new way to 3D print with lasers instead of a nozzle squirting out soft concrete a high-intensity laser beam will melt the powdery regolith to transform it into a hard strong Building Material they're running experiments Now using the laser to create a small sample once that red light is on we're hot oh lots of power here we go here we go we watched on monitors as the arm got into position there's the laser oh that white thing's the laser so it's melting right now it's going up to say 1500° C it's going to complete its second pass you can see it emerging there see the dark object on the screen that's the object we just made with the laser they can add more regolith and Laser again and again to build in layers to go as high as they want which will be done remotely from Earth it takes hours to cool so they showed me a sample they' made days earlier this is pretty darn hard that's our Landing Pad you're holding it yeah I'm holding The Landing Pad that's exactly right it's pretty cool that's a scientific term icon sends them to NASA where they're blasted with this special plasma torch the torch will be about 4,000 de to see if they can take the heat a landing pad would have to with stand see there oh there it is the torch is so bright you have to watch on a monitor that was it a few minutes later out it came oh it's just a little bit warm it looks good to me I don't see any loss of material I don't see any cratering it survived the test pass the test with flying colors the next test will be operating the entire robotic arm and Laser we'll put in a large scale simulant Bed inside NASA's giant thermal vacuum chamber which mimics the moon's extreme cold heat and vacuum conditions this is sort of like a Ballard's idea is to eventually send mobile 3D printers to the moon so this moves the printer around with a longer robotic arm sticking out of the top to print whatever is needed and then they would build the road and then they would build those habitats right it's and it wouldn't stop there if we can do it on the moon we can do it on Mars the Moon is actually harder it's harder Mars is uh almost in every way easier except for it's so far away easier they agree because for one thing Mars doesn't have extreme temperature swings still in my mind it's science fiction but in your minds it's absolutely in the palm of your hand it's going to happen we can see the steps in the technology to get us there now that's thrilling it's exciting quality can't go backwards in Block four icon says trying to 3D print on the moon and Mars is helping with their work here on Earth they are formulating new mixes to reduce the carbon footprint of their concrete we think we'll be there by end of year and they're trying out more radical architecture quite complex shapes and geometri almost looks like ripples on the surface of water patterned walls it's very subtle oh look at this yeah it almost looks impossible and next year as in these renderings they'll be printing round hotel rooms in Marfa Texas and futuristic looking designer homes you see a bedroom on that end with a shower and a bedroom here and here's a some renderings of the Interior wow right it gets you going doesn't it we're living at a time right now where a lot of CEOs have been caught over promising hyping um thinking of Theos you're absolutely right and it it's it's it's a tougher thing than you know because part of the job is to get your investors get your team and in our case the world um to believe the things you are saying except the things you are saying don't exist yet uh you need you need to get them to believe so it's hard to know like even in this interview I actually haven't yet told you all the things I believe we're going to do because I'm like measuring myself give us one example something wild I mean in the future I think most buildings will be designed by AI most projects will be run by software and almost everything will be built by robots and I don't think that's that far away I at my age find that very depressing but I'm sure young people that world housing will be more abundant more affordable more beautiful it will make this version of housing look depressing by example you know that expression if it seems too good to be true it is or I do know that expression uh but cars and airplanes and moon landing seem too good to be true for a moment as well and so like maybe the only proof I can give you is like I'm betting my life on it like I have this one precious Life to Live and I'm using it to do this and if I could think of a better way I'd be doing that in instead or I'd go fishing like this is so hard and you like fishing and I love fishing we don't often think about how the sense of touch makes our lives possible we grip a paper coffee cup with perfect Force to hold it but not crush it our feet always find the floor but for people with artificial limbs or those with spinal injuries the loss of touch can put the world beyond their grasp 17 years ago the defense department launched a $100 million project to revolutionize prosthetic limbs the robotics you're about to see is amazing but as we first reported earlier this year even more remarkable is how the feeling of feeling is returning to people like Brandon prestwood for me me it was it's a battle if I wanted to live or die you weren't sure you wanted to live no I didn't know if I wanted to or not Brandon prestwoods battle began with the loss of his left hand in 2012 he was on a maintenance crew reassembling an industrial conveyor belt when someone turned it on my arm was dragged in pretty much up to the shoulder it crushed my bones in my arm and uh fed my arm through a gap about one inch how did they save your life The Other M guys jumped in they started basically taking the machine back apart uh once we got it back apart I could look in and see what was there and uh one of the gentleman was a Vietnam veteran and the Vietnam veteran knew what to do yeah the Vietnam veteran knew tourniquets but Presswood lost his hand and couldn't return to his job go eat with this yeah that sounds good after four years with a hook he told his wife Amy he wanted to volunteer for experimental research involving surgery at the VA I was not 100% on board to start with but I knew he had his mind set that he was he had to do this and I I couldn't hold him back 6 years later thanks to defense department and VA projects Presswood controls this hand with nothing but his thoughts everything still feel good probably when I get her turned around here electrodes implanted in muscles in his arm pick up his brain's electrical signals for movement a computer translates those signals to the hand how about the middle finger now sensors in the plastic fingers are connected to nerves in his arm to return a basic sense of touch close your eyes tell me when you're feeling each of these which he can demonstrate with his eyes closed pinky index that's not bad middle still requires a little bit but it's not bad biomed engineer Dustin Tyler leads This research at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA touch is about connection it's connection to the world it's about connection to others it's connection to yourself right I mean we never experienced not having touch it's the largest sensory organ on our body all right so go ahead Tyler first attempted an artificial Connection in 2012 he switched it on in a volunteer and wondered what would happen so I was concerned would it his whole hand would it be painful would it not feel anything we had no idea uh so one of those big moments in my career was he came in we first turned on the stimulus and he kind of stopped for a second and he goes That's my thumb that's the tip of my thumb this happened right away it didn't require any training of the brain no that was the beauty of it my thumb Brandon Presswood remembers the instant it happened to him that's my fingers I'm feeling my fingers that I don't have anymore I'm feeling them a definite feeling he told us but different it doesn't feel exactly like my right hand it's a tingling sensation it's not painful it's kind of like if your if your hand's been to sleep right at the end right before it wakes up that very for me it's Pleasant it's a pleasant tingling let's see if you can do on a cherry here a tingling that's light with a light touch but grows stronger the harder he presses eyes closed he can pinch a cherry firmly enough to pull it from its stem but not crush it you can feel this is light I had to use my lightest touch so if I hold this right here with an empty eggshell I can feel that I feel it in I feel it here and here it's a feeling more than a decade in the making at the beginning of this research how did you even imag imagine that this would be possible I didn't imagine I thought I imagined it was not going to be possible San Ben mayor at the University of Chicago is among the world's leading experts on the Neuroscience of touch in 2008 he joined the defense Department's project to revolutionize Prosthetics but he didn't think the Pentagon knew what it was up against there are a 100 billion neurons in the brain interconnected with a 100 Brillion synapses I mean the the the human brain is like the most complex system in the known universe too complex he believed to Target electrical stimulation to exactly the right neurons and when we electrically stimulate we activate hundreds thousands of them at the same time in ways that would never happen naturally it just seemed like that very impoverished interface with this nervous system would never do any able to do anything useful and turns out I was wrong he was proved wrong by his own research how you doing Scott nice to meet you nice to meet you Scott with volunteers including Scott Embry and you can feel that I feel it on my fingertips whose movement and sense of touch are limited by a spinal injury from a car accident computer ports in EMB skull are wired to the motor and sensory parts of his brain electrodes pick up the brain's electrical signals that were intended for the muscles a computer translates those signals to the robot arm we first saw this brain machine interface 10 years ago at the University of Pittsburgh but back then there was no sensation index finger in collaboration with pit neuroscientist slan bmea showed that signals for touch could be turn to the brain how can you possibly know what part of the brain is the tip of the index finger we took Scott and we put him in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner and then we had him imagine moving his thumb imagine moving his index imagine moving his his digits as we monitored his brain activity and lo and behold the sensory and motor parts of the brain that are involved in the hand lit up middle ring index there are challenges eventually the brain builds Scar Tissue at the implants limiting the motor electrodes but one patient implants have lasted 8 years in counting Scott embes have been working more than 2 years you have been a subject of this work for years now and I wonder why I wanted to have someone else have the opportunity to become independent again the most meaningful work of your life yes sir 100% the greatest Independence might be no prosthetic at all and we saw this astounding possibility with a Pioneer Austin Bean his brain impulses are rooted not to a robot but to implants in his own arm that fire his muscles what function did you have in this hand before the implants oh absolutely n nothing you couldn't move it at all now so only thing I can do really is shrug my shoulders and kind of shift them unfortunately that was all that came back after my accident his accident was on a vacation celebrating his college graduation diving into a submerged Sandbar left him quadriplegic now motor and sensory impulses flow through the ports in Bean's skull and a computer bypassing his damaged spine relax clothes the research is led by bolu AO a biomedical engineer at Case Western Reserve University our goal is to restore complete functionality of the upper arm including dextrous hand function and the ability to reach out so that Austin and others who have suffered you know severe spinal cord injury can regain some level of functional Independence bring my arm forward the Cradle under his arm only supports the weight all of the motion is his own it takes effort he has to concentrate little bit quicker open hand relax hand Clos hand relax hand open hand relax hand and the computer needs frequent adjustment how'd that feel good good but his parents Shelly and Brad showed us where this could lead carrot or would you like to have a nice granola bar I'll take the granola bar I figured Bean retained limited feeling after his injury which makes him ideal for evaluating the artificial sens touch point a finger so if I can extend first his motor skills let me open my hand for you continue to grow squeeze around it you'll feel me really start to dig in right there you got a grip yeah it really is let go yeah and I'll bring the arm back up congratulations yeah thank you thank you so muching amazing advances are coming quickly Danny wner lost his foot in Vietnam it's on okay but but 47 years later he was reconnected to touch in an artificial foot can you feel that on your toes yep which helps him balance climb stairs and walk on uneven ground Brandon prestwoods next device will replace some wiring with Bluetooth connections especially the Thumb Thumbs spot on the cost of his experimental rig and surgery is estimated at roughly $200,000 but an eventual commercial system May cost significantly less while delivering moments that are Priceless what did that mean to you to feel Amy's hand in yours the world I was a whole person again I didn't have to worry about those dark thoughts creeping back in it's just giving me back my husband hband who means the world to me um he's hisself again himself because the feeling of feeling is so much of what makes us human maybe that's why when we see a tender moment it is said to be touching I love you with a new strain of covid On The Rise and flu season just getting started we thought now would be a good time to consider what the pandemic has taught us about preventing the spread of potentially deadly respiratory infections it turns out viruses like the one that causes covid-19 can travel through the air much farther than 6 ft so Public Health advice focusing on social distancing handwashing and masking wasn't enough air quality scientists say from the start of the pandemic it also should have focused on improving the air we all breathe indoors now some companies are doing just that for the health of their workers and the health of their bottom line the original sin of the pandemic was the failure to recognize Airborne transmission Professor Joe Allen of Harvard's th Chan School of Public Health believes the rapid spread of covid in early 2020 was preventable think about the public health gains we've made over the past 100 years we've made improvements to water quality outdoor air pollution our food safety we've made improvements to sanitation absolute basics of Public Health where has indoor air been in that conversation it's totally forgotten about and the pandemic showed what a glaring mistake that was what do you think was lost because of that lag in understanding of how this was spread tens of thousands of lives in the US many more more globally not an exaggeration it's also no exaggeration to say those early days of covid were Unforgettable in the US by March 2020 the virus began taking its toll in places like the Life Care Center Nursing Home in Kirkland Washington 60 Mi away in Mount Vernon Washington the scet valley Corral held one of its weekly rehearsals in a church half the members stayed away but the other half showed up among them were board members Debbie Amos Mark and Ruth backland and koise bettinger so we just thought hand sanitizer wash your hands a lot you know don't hug each other cuz that's touch none of it was good enough within a few days Corral members began to get sick in all Co hit 53 of the 61 people there that night two of them both in their 80s died a week we were going th this has got to be spread some other way it because we were good we were good So Co was percolating and you thought you were doing everything you were supposed to do yes right scatchet County Health officials said the rehearsal could be considered a super spreading event one of the earliest in the country and concluded that choir members had an intense and prolonged exposure to surfaces droplets and possibly even microscopic Airborne particles called aerosols containing the virus that caught the attention of Lindsay Maher of a Virginia Tech University Professor specializing in aerosol science and several of her fellow researchers even though the medical community was focused on droplets surfaces and handwashing these researchers strongly believed covid was mostly an airborne disease but needed more proof so they launched their own analysis I thought wow this is even worse than I thought this has to be airborne there's really no other explanation for it some people are going to say oh they all touched the same door knob but after the first few people touch that doorknob there there's no more virus left that's what happens with our exhaled breath now Professor Maher used a portable fogger to help explain how so many choir members could have gotten sick when they're singing they are releasing virus particles into the air constantly probably like this and those are going to drift around in the room notice they're not just falling to the ground and now as we continue to sing there's more and more of them in the room and you can see as they're drifting around they're reaching these other people nearby and they were there for 2 and 1 half hours and you can imagine that after that amount of time the other people would have breathed in enough of them to get sick themselves especially if at night the HVAC system was turned off as far as we know it wasn't running and so there were very there was very poor ventilation in that room when this was all happening an HVAC unit short for heating ventilation and air conditioning is the heart and lungs of any building the researcher suspected the thermostat most likely shut off the HVAC unit because the Corral members were generating enough heat on their own and right now there's no ventilation very very low okay and actually it's similar to what was in the church where the the the group was rehearsing then Professor Mah turned up the circulation to show us how better air flow could have helped remove aerosols and slow the spread of virus instead of just drifting all over the room oh you can actually see it right going up I sure can that is dramatic to see that the analysis led to one of the most significant papers on the importance of ventilation published during the pandemic then last year a study in Italy went further it found that by using a school's fans and air ducts to mechanically exchange indoor air with outdoor air five times an hour the risk of covid-19 infections decreased by at least 80% but in the US it took until this past May for the CDC to recommend an air exchange rate at all if you look at the way we design and operate buildings and I mean offices schools local coffee shop we haven't designed for health we have bare minimum standards in schools the minimum air change by Design is about three air changes per hour and remember we want at least four to six if we'd had these indoor air quality targets before the pandemic how do you think the pandemic would have unfolded differently we still would have had spread this isn't an end the pandemic thing we would have had a lot less of it and we've had a lot less of these super spreading events think about the early days of the pandemic with flatten the curve stay home why wasn't improve indor air quality part of flatten the curve we had tools to protect ourselves masking great tool it's a filter but we ignored the building side of this so Ain buildings are Allen's business as the founder of Harvard's healthy buildings program he diagnoses problems in air quality systems and comes up with solutions for clients that include cbs's parent company Paramount and commercial real estate companies like Beacon Capital partners with buildings like this one in downtown Boston and he advised Amazon before these new 22-story towers opened last May in Arlington Virginia where gave us a tour what does a state-of-the-art building look like in terms of air well you see a lot of the elements in this building you have a dedicated outdoor air system that's delivering air above the minimum requirements then it's going through two Merv 13 filter Banks you have highly filtered air MV stands for minimum efficiency reporting value a rating of 13 means it catches up to 90% of Airborne particles depending on their size as the first line of defense not just just against covid but other Airborne respiratory viruses like flu and RSV this is the part of the building nobody ever sees but this determines whether or not you're healthy or sick in the building really what happens in this space you can just see the filters on the right here at Amazon's new offices the top floor is a maze of Motors pipes and air ducts this is the air intake part of a $2.5 million HVAC system that begins with massive rooftop Vents and dampers right here this is the whole air handling system this is where the air comes into the building it's filtered it's cooled and then delivered this determines how much air actually reaches the office space where people are working and how clean that air is downstairs each floor has a sensor that tells building Engineers about the quality of the indoor air such as levels of carbon dioxide known as CO2 we breathe out the carbon dioxide that's right the less carbon dioxide the better the ventilation really straightforward high carbon dioxide means you're not getting enough outdoor air from that system we just looked at if it's low you're in good shape then we also measure particles that tells us things about like outdoor air pollution the entire system can be monitored and controlled from the basement remember we talked about carbon dioxide as an indicator for ventilation well I can see in this building all of these are Under 800 parts per million so that's good that's great and really important if a lot of people went into a space the CO2 level would rise this system would recognize it the dampers would open up and bring in a lot more outdoor air Katie Hughes Amazon's director of health and safety pointed to the waves of wildfire smoke that have swept down from Canada as the ultimate test of the indoor air quality system not too long ago Washington and Virginia were sort of smothered by this smoke coming down from Canada what happened in this building you would expect the air quality within the facility to not be great our buildings were performing very well again Hughes says Amazon has been updating many of its HVAC systems including in its warehouses a recent survey of facility managers in the US and Canada found that since March 2020 roughly two-thirds of respondents have upgraded their myrr filters and increase their air exchange rates in New York City JP Morgan Chas says its new headquarters will have state-of-the-art air quality controls and this new skyscraper called one Vanderbuilt already runs a modern back system Co shifted everybody's mindset in terms of air quality in terms of communicable or infectious diseases are you finding that Amazon is making a business decision partially by saying look it's okay for you to come back to work because we're telling you that the air inside this building is safe I think it's one of many reasons why we expect or would like people back in the office that is a a good thing to have it's probably one of many things a well operating HVAC system is not only good for the health of employees it can be good for the health of companies too especially with people working remotely leaving many commercial building owners looking for tenants there's empty office space in New York City and elsewhere how do you think this new thinking might affect that in terms of people even wanting to come to work the dynamic has changed it's a total buyers or tenants Market all outs equal which building are you going to go to you have your choice right now this building that put in healthy building controls or this building that's designed the way we've always designed buildings and is prone to being a sick building so it actually can help the bottom line in addition to of course improving Health yeah what about retrofitting a building that's old I think it's a misconception that old buildings can't be healthy buildings some of these fixes don't take much improving the level of fil ation that's easy it's cheap protects against covid-19 influenza also protects against Wildfire smoke and outdoor air pollution protects against allergens simple absolute basic things that can be done the scet valley Corral rehearsals are now in a different church with the new HVAC system doors stay open to bring in fresh air regardless of the season and there are even portable carbon di dioxide monitors to track ventilation we've been through a traumatic experience and we've tried to learn from that and did help the science with the aerosol study and now we're moving on in a way that we can still sing but in a more safe manner do you worry that when the spotlight of the pandemic starts to fade that people will forget and that they won't act the way they should in terms of buildings I'm a bit more optimistic than that I think there are fundamental shifts that have happened the scientific and medical literature is being Rewritten the government and standard setting bodies are setting new health-based standards businesses are responding and won't forget what this meant to their employees health and their business so I don't think we're going to forget these lessons we better not this year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of concentration camps across Europe most of the survivors Who Remain are now in their 80s and 90s so soon there will be no one left who experien the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand no one to answer questions or bear witness to Future Generations but as we first reported earlier this year a new and dramatic effort is underway to change that by harnessing the Technologies of the present and the future to keep alive the ability to talk to and get answers from the past hi Aaron hello can I ask you some questions you can ask me anything you want within reason our interview with Holocaust Survivor Aaron elster who spent two years of his childhood in a neighbor's attic was unlike any interview we have ever done Aaron tell us what your parents did before the war they owned and operated a butcher shop it wasn't the content of the interview that was so unusual where did you live I was born in a small town in Poland called sov podlaski it's the fact that this interview was with a man who was no longer alive Aaron ster died two years ago what's the weather like today I'm actually recording I cannot answer that question the survivors were getting very old Heather Mayo came up with the idea for this project she had worked on exhibits featuring Holocaust Survivors for years and wanted future generations to have the same opportunity to interact with them as she' had I wanted to talk to to a holocaust Survivor like I would today with that person sitting right in front of me and we were having a conversation she knew that back in the 90s after making the film Schindler's List Steven Spielberg created a foundation named for the Hebrew word for the Holocaust shaah come on ahead and sit on down to film and collect testimonies from as many survivors as possible you're they have interviewed nearly 55,000 of them so far and have stored them at the University of Southern California but Mayo dreamed of something more dyamic being able to actively converse with survivors after they're gone and she figured in the age of artificial intelligence tools like Siri and Alexa the technology had to be creatable I've been involved in interviewing Holocaust Survivors for over 20 years iot she brought the idea to Steven Smith executive director of the USC showa foundation and now her husband he loved it but some of his colleagues weren't so sure one of them looked at me she was like you want to talk to dead people and you said yes because that's the point that's the point well maybe people thought you're turning the Holocaust into something maybe hokey yeah they said that you're going to Disney by you know Disney by the Holocaust we had a lot of push back on this project is it the right thing to do what about The Well of the survivors are we trying to keep them alive beyond their death everyone had questions except for one group of people the survivors themselves who said where do I sign up I would like to participate in this project no barriers to entry actually I did both I actually first Survivor they signed up to do a trial run was a man named Pinkus gutter who was born in Poland and deported to the midic concentration camp with his parents and twin sister Sabina at the age of 11 he's the only one who survived they flew Pinkus from his home in Toronto to Los Angeles and asked him to sit inside this so you're in this Dome what yeah I called it the sphere they called it the Dome and then eventually it was called a bubble a bubble surrounding him with lights and more than 20 cameras what's our f- stop the goal was to Future prooof the interviews so that as technology ad advances and 3D hologram like projection becomes the norm they'll have all the necessary angles so the very first day we went to film pinkas we had these Ultra high-speed cameras that were all linked together and sync together to make um this video of him so and we sit down and they press record nothing happens so Pinkus is sitting there with 6,000 LED lights on him and cameras are don't work can I go back to sleep now sunglasses shielded his eyes when are we going to start I was bored sitting in that chair so I started singing to [Music] myself so suddenly Steven had this idea oh he's singing we're going to record some songs of his he was such a good sport he was really good sport eventually the cameras rolled and Pinkus was asked to come back to the bubble for the real thing how long were you in that chair a whole week from 9: to 5:00 a week we were there with breaks for lunch and but I was there from 9: to 5:00 answering questions oh my gosh it took so long because they asked him nearly 2,000 questions the idea was to cover every conceivable question anyone might ever want to ask him did you have to look exactly the same I had to wear the same clothes and I had three pairs of the same jackets the same shirts the same trousers the same shoes every morning Pinkus can now be seen in those shirts trousers and shoes at Holocaust museums in Dallas Indiana and here at the Illinois Holocaust Museum in skoki outside Chicago where visitors can ask him their own questions what kept you going or what gave you hope while you were experiencing hardship in the camps we did hope that that the Nazis would lose their War Pink's image is Project Ed onto an 11t High screen what we see here Smith joined us to explain how the technology works so what's happening is all of the answers to the questions that Pinkus gave uh go into a database then when you ask a question the algorithm is looking through all the database do I have an answer to that and then it'll bring back what it thinks is the closest answer to your question I'm going to try talking to pinkas yes all right did you have a happy childhood I had a very happy childhood my parents were wine makers my father started teaching me to become a wine maker when I was three and a half years old and by the age of five I could already read and I could already write wow you're very smart thank you I've noticed there's a little jiggle right before pinka starts to talk what is that what you seeing here isn't a human being it's it's video clips that are are being buttered up to each other and played and as it searches and brings the clip in you just you're seeing a little bit of a a jump cut the jump Cuts stop being distracting once we started talking about the fate of Pink's family tell us what happened when you got to the camp as soon as we arrived there we were being separated into different groups and my sister uh was somehow pushed towards the children and I saw her she must have spot at my mother so she ran towards my mother I saw my mother and she hugged her and since that time I all I can remember whenever I think of my sister is her long big long blonde braid that was the last time he saw his twin sister Sabina he learned later that day that she and both his parents had been killed in the gas Chambers Pinkus was alone at age 11 put to work as a slave laborer did you ever see anybody killed unfortunately I saw many people die in front of my eyes there were people I wasn't sure how a recording would handle what I wanted to ask Pinkus next how can you still have faith in God how can you possibly not believe in God well how did he let this happen God gave human beings the knowledge of right and wrong and he allowed them to do what they wished on this Earth to find their own way to my mind when God sees what human beings are up to especially things like genocide he weeps wow Stephen I could ask him questions for 10 hours and on the screen yeah W since Pinkus gutter was filmed the shawa foundation has recorded interviews with 21 more Holocaust Survivors each for a full week and they've Shrunk the setup required so they can take a mobile rig on the road to record survivors close to where they live they've deliberately chosen interview subjects with all different wartime experiences survivors of a hidden children and as we saw last fall in New Jersey going to hook me up again yep 93 year-old Alan Mosin who isn't a holocaust Survivor he was a liberator entering that camp was uh the most horrific site I've ever seen or ever hoped to see the rest of my life Mosin was an 18-year-old private when his army unit liberated a little known concentration camp called goons Kirin there was a pile of skelet like bodies on the left there was another pile of skelet like bodies on the right those poor souls that's the term my lieutenant kept screaming oh my God you look at these poor souls look each of Alan mosin's answers is then isolated by a team of researchers at the shaa foundation office I remember the expression and the attitude of all of us what in the freak what is this God Almighty who add into the system a variety of questions people might might ask to trigger that response for every question that we asked there are 15 different ways of asking the same question and that's fed in and that's all manual editors rotate the image turn the green screen background into black and then a long process of testing begins some of it in schools so Mr pinkas on your screen students are asked to try it out ask whatever question they want and see if the system calls up the correct answer how did you find out that you your city was getting invaded by Germany would you ever want to seek revenge how did you feel about your family can you rephrase this please every question and response is then reviewed we log every single question that's asked of the system and see if there is a better response that addresses that question more directly as we discovered it's still a work in progress tell us about your family when you were a little boy how about you ask me about life after the war so a couple of things about artificial intelligence it is mainly artificial and not so intelligent yet for now but the beauty of artificial intelligence is it develops over time so we aren't changing the content all the answers remain the same but over time the range of questions that you can ask will be enhanced considerably and you had to stay silent questions to draw out what it was like for Aaron elster hiding in that attic 75 years ago I used to pray to God to let me live till I was 25 I wanted to taste what adulthood would be like the rest of that conversation with Aaron elster as well as one with a survivor of Joseph mangala's Infamous twin experiments at owitz when we come back so am I a lucky guy yes I am the whole point of the showa foundation's project is to allow meaningful conversations with Holocaust Survivors to continue even after the survivors themselves are gone and of the more than 20 men and women who've participated so far four have passed away already tonight we wanted to share conversations with two of them conversations that at times felt so normal we could almost forget we were talking to the digital image of someone who was no longer living first a spunky 4 fo9 woman named Eva core an identical twin who together with with her sister survived aitz and the notorious experiments of Dr Joseph mangala Eva core spent her life after the war in terot Indiana she died last summer at the age of 85 hi Eva how are you today I'm fine and how are you I'm good it felt natural to answer her question before posing my own so how how old were you when you went to aitz when I arrived in aitz I was 10 years old and I stayed in AIT until Liberation which was about 9 months later when we were liberated so we made a little announcement about the fact we were starting this project I get a call the next day from A lady called Eva cor I didn't know her at that point in time and she says I want to be one of those 3D interviews I Steven Smith executive director of the USC showa foundation and his wife and colleague Heather Mayo Smith were running the project I said well I'm traveling I'm very sorry where are you going uh well I've got to go to New York I'm going to DC when are you going to go to DC I'm going to DC turns out we were going to the same event in DC I arrive at my hotel she's sitting in the lobby waiting for me when Eva on the right and her twin twin sister Miriam arrived at aitz they were pulled away from their parents and older sisters and taken to a Barrack full of twins they never saw their family again 50 years ago at a railroad 60 Minutes reported on mangala's Twin experiments in a story back in 1992 and the reason that my number is not and we actually interviewed the living Eva core at her home in terot Eva told us then about becoming extremely sick after an injection mangala came in every morning and every evening with four other doctors and he declared very sarcastically laughing too bad she's so young she has only two weeks to live when I heard that I knew he was right and I immediately made a silent pledge that I will prove you you Dr mangala wrong imagine picking up a conversation almost 30 years later and after Eva's death Eva tell us about Dr mangala what was he like he had a gorgeous face a movie star face and very pleasant actually dark hair dark eyes when I looked into his eyes I could see nothing but evil people people say that the eyes are the center of the soul and in manger case that was correct Eva and Miriam are visible in footage taken by the Soviet forces that liberated awit 75 years ago they went back to the camp many times Eva continuing to go even after Miriam's death in 1993 because if the train came on that direction it was on one of those visits that Eva made a stunning announcement I Eva Moses that she had decided to forgive her Nazi captors hereby give amnesty to all Nazis who participated she came under blistering attack from other survivors how can you forgive H how is that possible my forgiveness does not mean that I forget what happened which is impossible my forgiveness is an act of self-healing self Liberation and self-empowerment are you able to forgive Aaron I cannot forgive Aaron ster disagrees for them to get forgiveness they have to ask my little sister Sarah whom they brutally murdered I have no right to forgive and I will not forgive what's important for me in this project is that we have Holocaust survivors who have different points of view about God and religion and faith and forgiveness and that's what this project will allow us to do Aaron ster unlike many Holocaust Survivors never spent time in a concentration camp as Jews were being rounded up in his Town's Marketplace and sent to trinka his father told him to run he was 9 years old and I managed to crawl into the seore that went along the marketplace the street and kept crawling till I felt I was out of sight stood up and started running he made it to the building of an older polish couple named the gersis who'd been customers at his family's butcher shop he shows up and she didn't want to take him he started crying and then she let him upstairs Aaron how long did you stay in the attic I lived in that attic for close to two years two years with just one visit a day to bring food and water what was it like in the Attic oh there's so many things that I remember the hunger the fear the absolute total loneliness what do you do all day you're sitting there I used to catch flies out of desperation tear their wings off so they wouldn't fly away so I H them there h how did you survive how did you survive in that attic I had the ability to daydream I used to write novels in my head I was the hero all the time and we have that ability to either give into our misery and our pain and die or absorb the physical pain but keep your mentality keep your soul keep your mind so was I bored was I scared was I in need of somebody to accept me or to tell me that I'm okay that I'm a nice kid sure but that was not part of my life we got a phone call to say that Aaron elster had suddenly passed away I was at a conference at that time the next morning I went into the uh little room that we had and I turned on Aaron st's testimony and I realized I was going to be the first person ever to click that little button and ask a question of somebody who was no longer alive when for the next 6 hours people came in and out of that room his funeral had not yet taken place and yet the Legacy was already continuing and it was a very powerful and touching moment you're good you're doing great a touching moment that may soon be available to others beyond the community of Holocaust Survivors they're going to come in and they're going to have you look Heather Mayo Smith says in the process of developing and testing this technology she was barraged with inquiries there wasn't one person literally not one that didn't ask me if they could do a similar interview with either a loved one for themselves unrelated to the Holocaust unrelated completely unrelated can I do this with someone that I know what's the answer yes she has started an independent company that's trying to expand the use of this technology I was an astronaut for NASA recording interviews with other historical figures like astronauts and eventually with anyone at all what unit were you in during World do you think that this is just going to be a tool that people use everybody will be recording their histories other people can interview them mhm it'll just be life yeah we're going to go ahead and get started for now though the race is on to capture interviews with as many Holocaust Survivors as possible while there's still time so the conversations can continue always with people like Aaron elster do you want revenge when I was a Youngster I wanted Revenge very very very much and I hate it I hate it but most of the perpetrators most of the killers are dead so who am I going to hate the grandchildren that had nothing to do with it's not right revenge is not part of my life not part of my thinking you know here you have these people who were basically destined to be annihilated that they survived as the miracle but they were supposed to be murdered killed and now they have immortality they were not supposed to have a name they were supposed to be destroyed for all time and now through this program they will be able to continue to answer questions hundreds of years after the Nazis have gone it's that never forget we've had a lot of cliches around the Holocaust you know never again never forget we must remember all this sort of thing what this does it makes sure that there isn't closure because it's not about a statement it's not about a particular thing that's being instructed of you the onus is on you to ask the questions the onus is on you to be curious and to want to know and so in a sense it turns the learning on its head and says I'm not going to tell you what the lessons of the Holocaust are I'm not going to tell you what the Holocaust means but if you want to find out then you can ask it's so terribly important so there we were at a special moment in time when the living pink scooter could talk to the one who will live forever would you ask you a question for us I will ask the one which is my favorite okay can you sing me a song from your youth you want me to sing it for you yes [Music] [Music] please what does that mean what is the song is it a happy song yeah with a happy song It's like a brother and a sister which of course my twin sister are traveling in the woods or on the on the road and they can't get over how beautiful the world is oh my God [Music] [Music]"

early days of the Space Race the Soviet Union racked up a lot of Firsts Sputnik the first satellite Leica the dog the first animal in space Yuri Gagarin the first man in space Valentina terova the first woman Zan 5 the first spacecraft to the Moon meanwhile America Space Program lagged plagued by setback after setback there were some successes but not enough to keep Pace with the Soviets America was still planning its first satellite while Sputnik circled the Earth then Sputnik to went up American citizens were terrified what if the Russians put weapons in space maybe they already have paranoia was starting to become Hysteria President Eisenhower was under pressure to act and to act fast the United States government knew what it had to do create an organization to develop the most technologically advanced military systems in the world and just 3 months after Sputnik 2 was launched the advanced research project agency or arpa was born later arpa became DARPA the d stands for defense because DARPA would be both a sword and a shield creating offensive weapons and defensive systems no project was too expensive and no program was too immoral darpa's secret research would cost many lives but sacrifices had to be made for the sake of security but after all these years it's time to ask who are they really [Music] protecting no no I didn't order any dumbbells no I didn't

files is also a podcast no plugs yet please we save those for the end sorry sorry I could sniff out a plug opportunity like a travel [Music] Pig the technology I described that got you to your destination ation it was created by DARPA all of it and there's a lot more of DARPA in your pocket than you think your cell phone uses microprocessors designed by DARPA they also created the batteries to power those microprocessors your phone uses Wireless technology made possible by DARPA the touchscreen and the microphone came from DARPA voice recognition and GPS come from DARPA and of course all this data transfer happens using the internet which was created by DARPA excuse me if I may H is this going to be a highly predictable and hack joke about how Al Gore said he created the internet I I yield the rest of my time thank you mhm yes DARPA created the internet well technically they were still arpa then remember the D was added in 1972 in the 1960s researchers were trying to figure out a way to ensure reliable Communications in case of a nuclear attack traditional phone lines and radio transmitters would be the first to go they came up with a radical idea packet switching not all of us speak nerd some of us went to our prom instead of staying home to write code on our Apple too well packet switching is not as complicated as it sounds here's how it works you want to send a message or file from New York to LA but what if half the country's lines are down so you break that message into small small chunks called packets and send each one independently over the network on the receiving end the message waits for all the packets to arrive and then reassembles them back into the original message or file each packet will independently try to find the most efficient route through the network at any given moment the internet still works this way most people didn't use the internet until the late 1990s or early 2000s some nerds like me were using our phones to dial bulletin board systems in the late 1970s and early 80s but this new network called arpanet was conceived in 1966 w w w w w w you were online all the way back then when you were like 12 or 13 years old yep I was even younger than that when I first got online and you're proud of this well yeah shouldn't I be you even know girls existed yes I knew they existed yeah now I see what girls didn't know you existed I was a late bloomer Bloomer Bloomer what' I say under ARA's guidance tcpip became the universal language for online computers they also developed the concept of email and invented domain names DARPA worked with UC Berkeley to create the BSD Unix operating system BSD Unix heavily influenced the operating system you're using right now no matter what OS it is it started with DARPA now these Technologies may seem modern but DARPA sent the first internet message in 1969 now this shouldn't be surprising DARPA technology is said to be about 20 years ahead of Civilian Tech like self-driving cars DARPA built one in 1984 DARPA had GPS in 1973 microprocessors motion sensors and wireless communication DARPA had these decades ago but eventually these Innovations became available to the rest of us darpa's technology has made our lives so much better it's easy to forget those Innovations weren't originally meant to improve lives they were meant to end them it's the middle of the night and you're lying prone on top of a Dusty building in some Far corner of the world you hug your 50 caliber Barrett sniper rifle it's pitch dark but your light Gathering High magnification scope gives you full visibility of the alley 1200 yd away a door opens it's your target right on schedule you hold your breath and put your finger on the trigger suddenly a van appears your target leaps in and speeds off years ago he'd escaped Mission failed not now you fire confident in darpa's latest Innovation a self-guided bullet with Optical sensors and realtime guidance it Maneuvers mid-flight locked onto its Target skilled snipers engage targets up to 1300 yards away or more the farthest confirmed kill 2.2 Miles by Canadian special forces in 2017 impressive but darpa's Extreme accuracy task ordinance or exacto bullet hits targets 5 or six miles away maybe farther DARPA keeps the details a secret many DARPA projects seem like science fiction some like magic scepter lets you see through walls the jav project bends light making objects invisible darpa's engineering living materials program uses living fungus as a construction material structures will no longer be built they'll be grown instead of shipping finished materials we can ship precursors and rapidly grow them on site using local resources and since the materials will be alive they'll be able to respond to changes in their environment and heal themselves in response to damage DARPA likes fungus but it loves bugs project insect allies modifies flying insects to attack crops these insects resist disease and repair each other's injuries in the field then there's the hybrid insect microelectrical mechanical systems or high MMS this project along with project dragonfly creates miniature flying cyborgs beetles moths and dragonflies become undetectable spies with cybernetic implants and solar powered guidance systems they could be controlled remotely or operate autonomously using AI they've created remote controlled rats DARPA trains bees to find landmines they're developing clay Tronics programmable shape-shifting matter they're developing nuclear-powered spacecraft autonomous vehicles and weapons of all kinds darpa's technology is meant to keep people off the battlefield why risk a battalion of human soldiers when you can deploy a fleet of drones but sometimes you need boots on the ground and that means people with guns but DARPA has a better idea don't give a soldier a weapon turn them into one the human body is an amazing machine our muscular skeletal system allows us to do gymnastics lift heavy weights and walk long distances still our bodies have limitations DARPA is developing technology to overcome these limitations the goal is to increase strength endurance alertness and the overall health of soldiers darpa's Warrior web project is one of several exoskeleton programs in the works it's an Exo Suit lightweight and flexible similar to a scuba suit but this is a smart suit using machine learning and onboard sensors the suit knows when and where to firm up to augment muscles it performs its function then becomes flexible again DARPA has also developed hard exoskeletons just like you've seen in movies like aliens and Edge of Tomorrow these exoskeletons not only increase strength and endurance but they're modular they can be equipped with all kinds of weapons there's even a jetpack in development the Tallow suit turns a soldier into a real life iron man it's bulletproof and weaponized it increases strength speed and endurance it monitors the user's vital signs and has sensors that analyze the entire environment around them the Tactical augmented reality or t project is a headset that overlays information over your normal vision this gives soldiers real-time information like displaying Maps enemy locations and other vital data right in their line of sight project zman was inspired by geckos DARPA is creating a material that would let soldiers climb walls without ropes or ladders now everyone knows the Air Force gives a Pilots amphetamin they feel the need the Need for Speed the Need for Speed yep they literally take illegal narcotics to stay alert but the continuous assisted performance or cap program is focused on keeping soldiers awake alert and effective for up to 7 days straight without side effects darpa's brain Initiative Program connect soldiers brains to computers they can control drones and other systems with thought they can truly multitask where one part of the brain is operating a drone while the other part of the brain is analyzing the area looking for Targets in the early 2000s DARPA started exploring ways of giving humans superhuman abilities without equipment this is darpa's bio Revolution program they studied how animals attack defend themselves and regenerate from injuries DARPA felt that if they could find those answers these abilities could be transferred to humans they could give soldiers improved senses perfect eyesight and limb regeneration without external devices now to do that you'd have to alter human DNA so DARPA is exploring crisper Gene editing technology crisper can snip out unwanted jeans and insert new ones crisper could accelerate healing injuries that might have sidelined soldiers for weeks or months could heal in days crisper technology has already sparked a revolution in medicine with the potential to cure genetic disorders and even combat aging link below on how crisp and AI are about to end the whole world yeah that episode is scary but it's interesting and it's real now some of these projects have failed and some haven't and some are still in development I have no doubt that DARPA will turn soldiers into superhuman weapons eventually but they haven't yet so how do you put boots on the ground and keep humans off the battlefield darpa's answer Killer Robots [Music] DARPA started working on robotics in the 1960s its first project was shaky the first mobile robot to reason about its actions shaky wasn't Sleek or fast but it was a start ah you know I I feel like if you name your project shaky yeah you're kind of setting yourself up to fail well since then darpa's robotics has come a long way in the early 2000s DARPA launched the big dog program in partnership with Boston Dynamics these four-legged robots can carry heavy loads and navigate difficult terrain they can also be outfitted with weapons like sniper rifles or machine guns the LS3 can follow soldiers autonomously and carry up to 400 lb of gear and then there's the atlas robot and now we're getting serious Atlas was launched in 2013 and you've probably seen various versions of this robot over the years Atlas could run jump and navigate obstacle courses a couple of years ago Atlas used AI to teach itself how to walk and then run and then do gymnastics yeah you humans realize it's only a matter of time before these things take over and enslave you right uh some of us realize it investigative journalist Annie Jacobson has covered DARPA for years she says there's no doubt that the Pentagon is investing heavily in robotics darpa's plan through 2038 states without question that the Pentagon is moving towards robotic Warfare they want to have hunter killer drones that can swim crawl walk run drones that can fly 13,000 M an hour which is 22 times faster than a commercial jet to get to a Target really quickly ballistic missiles have limitations speeds over mach 20 require too much power and make the Rockets dangerously hot but thanks to DARPA that's no longer a problem missiles can now travel at Hypersonic Speed without overheating a Target 500 M away can be destroyed in 6 minutes weapons like these certainly keep humans off the battlefield but DARPA is going to take it one step further it's creating the technology to wage war without needing humans at all remember how DARPA is always about 20 years ahead of Civilian technology maybe more well as early as the 1960s DARPA started developing computers that can learn independently in the 1980s DARPA launched the Strategic Computing initiative or seci the goal of seci was to create military strategies by running simulations and learning from them you're describing war games what's it doing Le War Games was originally going to be a science fiction story about a dying scientist who's saved by a kid genius but then the writers met Peter Schwarz from the Stanford Research Institute or SRI SRI I know those guys you do SRI has been the Launchpad for many government programs I've talked about them a lot on this channel and they've long been connected to the CIA NSA and DARPA well Schwarz was fascinated by a new computer subculture called hackers he suggested that they make a movie about a kid hacking a military supercomputer oh yeah yeah yeah was it was called the uh the Big Mac no Whopper War operation plan response oh right I'd still rather have a big neck me too well the Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War I 24 hours a day 365 days a year it plays an endless series of War games using all available information on the state of the world at the very same time that this movie came out DARPA was working on its own military supercomputer here's how they described it the machine Invision by SC would run 10 billion instructions per second to see hear speak and think think like a human the degree of integration required would rival that achieved by the human brain the most complex instrument known to man if you haven't caught on by now we're talking about artificial intelligence today AI is everywhere and accessible to everyone and it feels like it came out of nowhere but it didn't it came out of DARPA as of today 70% of darpa's projects use or are focused on AI and machine learning darp started working on AI in the 1960s they built their first AI system a speech recognition computer in the 1970s in 1983 the Strategic Computing initiative project received billions for AI research then in the 1990s DARPA launched another supercomputing project it was and still is highly secret it's affecting you right now and once I tell you what it is you're not going to like it now it's time to get this video demonetized and censored yeah boy yeah if I'm not on a list by now I I'm about to be no they're watching you human yeah I I really don't want to talk about this honestly I'm about to put everything that I have at risk uh you're actually scaring me right now I'm scared too here we go [Music] [Music] welcome like the steam engine which sparked the industrial revolution of the late 1700s the internet is changing everything it touches and at The Cutting Edge of the revolution is Wall Street so we are now 6 and 3/4 points above fair value the early 1990s was the beginning of the tech boom internet startups were getting millions in Investments 22 Fus is look at 39 and about 35,000 if you want to buy 10 grand and they had access to vast resources and vast amounts of data personal data the intelligence Community wanted to gather this data to create a digital fingerprint of everyone using the internet if they could identify Bad actors criminals terrorists whatever they would compare that fingerprint against others they called this the birds of a feather approach if Joe's a bad guy and Bob's a bad guy and they both go to certain websites then other people visiting those same websites were potential bad guys so let's track them so surveillance yes of Americans yes legal no well officially illegal as of 2010 but the law was murky in the 1990s and for the intelligence Community murky means opportunity still the intelligence agencies didn't have the ability to manage all this data but they knew people were out there working on it and they were all looking for funding but if you're the NSA or CIA or DARPA you can't drop by an internet startup and ask them to build you an illegal digital surveillance program oh yeah it's kind of a bad look it is but it also gives away the game surveillance is only valuable if the target doesn't know they're being watched so this technology would need to be funded privately and quietly so in 1994 the highlands Forum was founded ever hear the highlands Forum you probably haven't and they like it that way the highlands Forum or Highlands group was formed as a think tank a bridge between technology companies and the Pentagon the highlands forum is an invitation only group of government officials academics and Executives from Tech and defense companies their discussions are private and off the Record operating under the chadam house rule meaning members can disclose information from the meetings as long as it doesn't harm anybody but they can never reveal who said it not ever although hardly anyone knows about the highlands Forum the group is highly influential on us defense policy especially regarding technology and they're a private Organization no auditing no oversight no Freedom of Information Act requirements they're a black box the perfect conduit for transactions you want to keep off the books so Tech is booming data is flowing and we've got our Think Tank to connect us with the people capturing the data now we need the money to fund them that same year the massive Digital Data Systems or mdds program was launched mdds would fund scientists researchers and companies who worked with big data sets the Highland Forum would help identify facilitate and coordinate these transactions to keep these transactions private and secret the mdds moved money through unclassified mainstream agencies like the National Science Foundation computer scientists were getting millions in Grants from the NSF totally normal they didn't know who was really behind the money and mdds was highly compartmentalized it had tons of projects and departments nobody knew what anyone else was doing or who was even in charge and this was by Design but the overall program was managed by the CIA NSA and DARPA so we've got black budget money flowing through the NSF and we've got our private organization the highlands forum looking for opportunities so the word goes out to researchers in Academia if you can handle big data we'll give you big money then a promising project emerged two Stanford Graduate students working on a search engine made a [Music] breakthrough in the early '90s searching the Internet Was difficult popular engines like altav Vista and lyos produced Hit or Miss results searching hiking gear would show Pages mentioning hiking or gear often irrelevant blog posts or articles users had to scroll through pages of useless results it took forever and I remember it well two Stamford students developed a system that changed everything their automated webcrawling system identified a web Page's context not just the text then Pages were ranked based on relev to specific queries Pages actually discussing hiking gear would rank higher for that query high traffic pages and pages with lots of incoming links ranked even higher these were signals to the algorithm that a page was a good match for that query using this search engine felt like magic usually the first or second result was exactly what you were looking for somehow it knew the system used an optimization technique called Association rule Ling or query flocks this assumes birds of a feather stick together meaning people searching specific keywords tended to click the same result query flocks worked with people too the search engine learned that people with similar online habits search for similar things if you searched hiking gear the system assumed you liked outdoor activities and were probably within a certain age group and the more you used the search engine the more it learned about you so your searches always gave you relevant results using information you willingly provided these students had developed a method to create your digital fingerprint [Music] jackpot the CIA NSA and DARPA learned about this project and through the National Science Foundation the mdds funded it if you haven't guessed by now those two students were Sergey Brin and Larry pagee and the search engine was Google you won't find mdds in Google's origin story but this is public unclassified information it's just hard to find in Brenan Page's famous 1998 research paper the anatomy of a large scale hypertextual web search engine they thank DARPA for their support you can see this for yourself it's on page 16 section 7 under acknowledgements now there's a lot more to this Rabbit Hole the connection between intell agencies and technology companies is so hang on hang on what pop quiz go ahead how do you make your living YouTube and who owns YouTube Google right bye-bye Channel now would be a good time you ask for patreon support I don't do plugs until the end of the episode make an exception we're in the deep water now he might be right truly and honestly I won't know until it's too late but telling you the story might have been a terrible mistake so yes please go to patreon.com theey files I don't know if we will but we might need your help anyway this video isn't about Google it's about DARPA specifically the Dark Side of DARPA and it's about to get a whole lot darker when John F Kennedy took office in 1961 America had allies everywhere Cuba Ethiopia Nicaragua La Vietnam Cambodia Iran Lebanon and many others but the Soviet Union was fueling insurrections against us-friendly governments Kennedy promised to stop the spread of Communism but the Soviets were pouring billions into military technology rocket and missile systems even space exploration JFK was committed to keeping Pace he wanted more resources in science and technology he modernized the military and double darpa's budget and the timing couldn't be better the global Cold War had evolved into Regional proxy wars with the Soviets a new type of warfare was being fought Guerilla Warfare old military strategies wouldn't work the situation in Vietnam was especially bad the Viet Kong were hidden under the thick jungle canopy you can't kill an enemy that you can't see Dara proposed a solution project agile it was pitched to Kennedy is both a scientific and Military Endeavor Kennedy signed off immediately the first phase was called operation Ranch Hand its purpose was to clear the jungle DARPA developed the rainbow herbicides named for their container colors to kill the foliage agent purple was first then green then pink DARPA was combining different herbicides defoliant and toxins looking for the perfect formula to destroy Viet Kon cover agent orange was the winner millions of gallons of Agent Orange was sprayed over miles of jungle every day leaves fell from trees almost immediately another application and the trees died next project agile targeted Farms Asian orange could destroy miles of crops in a day they asked South Vietnamese president DM if he knew which Farms were Viet Kong and which belonged to innocent civilians he said yes he knew and he didn't care if they weren't Traders yet they would be soon kill them all now the US didn't want to do this but it only had a few hundred military advisers in Vietnam at this time they didn't want to send more better to sacrifice North Vietnamese Farmers than US Marines so it was done guilty or innocent Friend or Foe if you were a North Vietnamese farmer you were targeted your crops were destroyed and your soil was poisoned replanting was impossible anent Orange's effects were instant and devastating and nobody knew it was only the beginning as the Vietnam War escalated so did the use of agent orange Under darpa's project agile project agile used other tactics DARPA contractors included social scientists and experts in human psychology propaganda spread through leaflets loudspeakers and media control subliminal technology kept people in heightened emotional states from minor discomfort to Absolute Terror subliminal Warfare mind control link Dan s psychological warfare teams targeted Villages turning neighbor against neighbor civilians were forced into strategic hamlets for their safety 4 million people were relocated against their will meanwhile soldiers complained of headaches nausea stinging eyes and rashes Agent Orange more than clear jungle and kill crops it tortured people for Life thousands exposed to agent orange developed cancer children were born with defects agan orangs caused reproductive problems like infertility and miscarriages heart disease and diabetes increased Asian orange was first used in 1962 in 1965 scientists discovered it contained dioxin a highly toxic compound that causes cancer and birth defects they kept using it in 1967 a study proved dioxin causes birth defects even at low concentrations they kept using it in 1969 a Department of Defense report acknowledged agent Orange's severe health risks they kept using it public outcry forced President Nixon to stop the use of Agent Orange in 1970 they kept using it they stopped spraying the following year 1971 [Music] now even in war There Are Rules PS must be treated humanely medical staff and facilities are off limits humanitarian Aid must be allowed breaking these rules is a war crime in 1907 the hay convention banned the use of poison in war the US signed the treaty agent orange was poison that's what herbicides are so was using agent orange a war crime no the United States said agent orange wasn't a poison it was an herbicide the treaty didn't specifically mention herbicides oh that's some loyal loophole  in 1925 the Geneva protocol banned the use of chemical weapons the US signed this treaty but agent orange was a chemical of the 12 companies producing Asian orange the primary manufacturer was the dowo chemical company the word chemical isn't the company's name so is using agent orange a war crime nope the United States said agent orange wasn't a chemical it was an herbicide wa wa wait how is that even possible it's not in 1949 the Geneva conventions established that civilians and their property must not be intentionally targeted only combatants and Military targets were allowed the US signed this treaty but civilians and their Farms were intentionally targeted with agent orange so was using it a war crime no the United States said the intent was to disrupt the enemy's logistical support and visibility not cause direct harm to people in other words it was an accident so what about the destruction of plants and trees on civilian land those weren't military targets isn't this a war crime no the United States said it was a military necessity to defoliate the area in order to deny the enemy cover which makes trees any trees anywhere a military Target what about destroying civilian crops again the US only intended to destroy crops of the enemy not civilians it was unintentional so no war crime in 1977 the Geneva conventions were amended to specifically ban the use of herbicides and reinforce civilian protection the US signed this new treaty but still denied any liability for the damage caused by agent orange however in 1984 US veterans Su the chemical companies who settled for $180 million but the settlement was to support veterans not an admission of guilt in 2004 Jill Montgomery speaking for the Monsanto company one of the major suppliers of Agent Orange uh she set the record straight we're sympathetic with people who believe they've been injured and understand their concern to find the cause but reliable scientific evidence indicates that agent orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects in 1991 finally the VA started providing benefits to vets exposed the agent orange but the US still denies liability my father-in-law served in Vietnam he was exposed to agent orange he's watching so I won't list his illnesses but he suffered almost all of them so in 1991 he applied for his benefits and I'll admit the government kept its word he did receive his benefits in 2021 it took years like so many vets when his country needed him he didn't hesitate but when he needed his country they said take a number get in line and hope you're still alive by the time we call your name do I sound angry that's because I [Music] am between 1955 and 1975 2.7 million people were deployed to Vietnam 50 8,000 dead 300,000 wounded 3,000 missing or prisoners of War 1500 still missing that's tragic but it's much worse the VA estimates 300,000 to 400,000 veterans may have died from illnesses caused by the exposure to agent orange may have to this day to this day no single person Agency company or government has admitted any wrongdoing or assumed any life ability for the millions of lives destroyed by agent orange now Ordinary People Like Us have so many rules we have to follow don't speed check Grandma's shoes before she gets on a plane pay your taxes even though we're going to steal it and waste your money pick up a gun shoot at those people do what you're told if we break a law the government will take our money seize our property Force us into labor or lock us in a Cell it all depends on the crime so we follow the law but if you're a big chemical company or a government agency don't worry about the law you can get away with [Music] murder ah I needed a a minute the story of DARPA is hard to debunk and that's because most of it's true what we know about darpa's projects come from them their websites and official YouTube channel openly share information they have a podcast called voices of DARPA even the experts and covering DARPA Annie Jacobson and Sharon Weinberger get their information from the agency they're writing about when Jacobson gives a speech writes a book or appears in an interview about DARPA she's not sharing classified information she's not speculating she's reporting she never claims to know anything that we can't find out for ourselves but still most information is secret what we know about DARPA is what they want us to know there's no transparency none also DARPA is exempt from laws that other government agencies have to follow specifically about hiring practices managing personnel and managing budgets they can run the agency however they like DARPA is only 220 people that's it with a budget of almost $4 billion now that's a lot of freedom and power but it's much more than that DARPA is allowed to fund projects through what's called other transactions no Congressional approval needed no reporting required choose the projects you want to fund and fund them so who's choosing the projects Annie Jacobson gives us an unsettling answer the real problem is that the individuals who are responsible for deciding what weapon systems are being financed and created in these classified DARPA programs are the very CEOs of Defense contractors who stand to financially benefit from these [Music] contracts Annie Jacobson has said that DARPA is the agency driving the military industrial complex that agency is run by the companies that profit from the technology they create this is exactly what President Eisenhower said would happen if you make war profitable you'll always have War but to be fair darpa's Innovations have made our lives better not just because of cell phones and GPS darpa's achievements in Prosthetics have allowed paralyzed children to walk again they've created medical techniques to diagnose illnesses early they've bioengineered tissue and organs that can be used for transplants they've developed machines that can stabilize injured people in emergency situations Advanced Medical Imaging such as ultrasound MRI and brain Imaging all created by or alongside DARPA now does the good outweigh the bad do darpa's contributions offset the damage they've done I don't know that's not for me to judge but the story reminds me of the courtroom scene in A Few Good Men you can handle the truth right when the colonel says my existence while grotesque and incomprehensible to you saves lives you don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties you want me on that wall you need me on that W right so is DARPA a necessary evil is evil even the right word I don't know when DARPA was formed in 1958 its mission was to make sure the United States was never again surprised by advance technology and for 66 years DARPA has succeeded in its Mission the US has never been surprised by technology except for the UFOs okay the US has never been surprised by another country's technology better I can't forget all the suffering that DARPA has caused but darpa's done so much good can I forgive I don't know I'm disgusted by some of darpa's actions by our government's corruption by the fact that because of DARPA bad people will get rich from war but if I'm being honest which I always am with you I have to acknowledge that as an American we need DARPA on that wall thank you so much for hanging out with me today my name is AJ that's cyle fish it's shaking sexy bacon this has been the wi files if you had fun or learned anything we had some fun today it wasn't all

8Vk_2Kq9Njw,13 Most EMBARRASSING Tech Fails of all time.,"Embarrassing tech fails, from Mcdonalds, to Tesla, to the global IT crisis...it gets bad. Check out Bitdefender here!",Mrwhosetheboss,2024-10-19T12:06:19Z,28,"['tech fails', 'tech', 'fails', 'rant', 'scam', 'embarrassing']",PT28M18S,4107105,5051,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology'],True,"prepare yourself for 13 of the most embarrassing Tech fails of all time from the keyboard with 113 OLED displays inside of it to PlayStation's most expensive mistake ever in history to literal Global apocalypse starting with McDonald's who in one of the weirdest collabs of all time went into partnership with IBM in 2021 to run a trial of an AI assisted voice ordering system at about 100 of their drive-throughs guess what happened when Tik Tok got their hands on it giving orders to the wrong cars multiplying items and I'm not talking someone walking away with a single extra chicken nugget people were leaving with hundreds of dollars worth of nuggets and I think the most embarrassing and yet at the same time also the most we probably should have seen this coming era giving people ridiculous combinations of products that any human would realize make no sense at all like ice cream with ketchup and butter or I really wish I was joking ice cream with bacon on top but hey at least that means the McDonald's ice cream machine was actually working for once all while having the audacity to correct the pronunciation of its customers and that says it's caramel like huh so yeah McDonald's basically had to end the trial ASAP but we got some pretty good laughs out of it a pretty harmless 1 out of 10 fail the same can't be said for number 12 though because in 2005 an unknown Russian design company called Art lebedev released a series of concept images for a revolutionary new type of keyboard a keyboard called the Optimus Maximus which yeah that's a pretty sick name where each individual key has its own tiny display and that's kind of amazing because it means every single key can be whatever you want it to be so let's say I get a little bored of the normal quiry keyboard layout bam and it's kind of mind frying just the power that this gives you every single key can be a letter a number a direct shortcut to a Photoshop tool or your ultimate moving League it's kind of like the MacBook touch bar but useful you could change your whole keyboard's language with one press and there's even a programmable side panel which could allow you to fast swap between applications now you might be thinking in 2005 surely that kind of miniaturized LCD display technology just wasn't there at the time and you would be right this was meant to be a concept but people just got so excited by it that leev decided this is our chance to do something big we actually have to make this thing they quickly realized that LCD displays at the time were too dim for what they wanted to do so they decided to go with OLED Tech that wasn't really a big thing yet in 2005 especially in such a tiny form which means that as well as having to make monster of a keyboard they also ended up having to create their own proprietary miniature OLED display technology just so they could fit one of them under each one of these transparent Keys which they did by working with a Taiwanese supplier called ID display and somehow after all of that they actually managed to ship a working product in 2008 sadly they got too caught up in the hype themselves this company became so obsessed with achieving this goal of 113 OLED displays that they forgot to actually make the typing experience good these Keys have such high resistance that you're just tired after like a minute of using it oh yeah and the thing was priced at $1,500 when it launched so only a very small fraction of the people who first expressed interest actually followed through and bought the thing I'm only going to give this a 2 out of 10 fail though because there was a silver lining remember I display well they put so much time and effort into helping to create this mini under keyboard OLED Tech that they decided to run with it anyway and they were eventually purchased by Elgato which is what led to the Elgato stream deck which even today is one of the must have gadgets for any streamer but not every story has a happy ending some of them have a nappy ending this is Paul and Rachel Baron who after being completely unable to find a washable swim nappy for their son that was actually good and actually fit decided to make their own they started a company called bow and Bell Littles selling them on Amazon and very quickly hit $1 million in sales these guys were killing it they were appearing on shows they were being profiled by Forbes but 4 years ago possibly the absolute worst thing that could have happened happened Amazon you know the nearly $2 trillion technology company sent one customer a used diaper and you bet that customer left a review the diaper arrived used and was covered in poop stains nothing could have been more disgusting these were not small stains either I was extremely grossed out now this sticky situation was nothing to do with the Barons this happened because the person at Amazon responsible for checking returned products before sending them out to new customers did a well a pant job but the worst part of this is after the Barons saw this review and they scurried to tell Amazon that it wasn't their fault that it could very heavily damage their business and to take it down Amazon refused and the Barons were right this one review did completely tank their business four years later they're now $600,000 in debt including a loan that has their house up as collateral it's only after Bloomberg published an article about the holder barkle that Amazon finally agreed to take the review down but the damage was already done so four out of 10 fail made worse by the fact that it wasn't even these guys fault so if you ever find yourself in the market for a washable swim nappy now you know where to go just maybe don't return it after you've used it okay we've seen all sorts of laptops over the years Super high-end gaming laptops super affordable $400 laptops but what on Earth does a $100 laptop look like well in 2005 the founder of the MIT media lab Nicholas Negron formed one laptop per child a nonprofit whose goal was to transform education in the developing World by creating and distributing as many devices as possible to children in schools and the device that was going to change children's lives the XO a quirky little green plastic laptop designed to be produced as cheaply as possible while still giving disadvantaged kids access to a computer and this thing had a lot of thoughtful features packed into it for its tiny cost especially considering this was 2005 a hand crank that would allow children to power their device even if they didn't have access to an electrical outlet which means that the device ran on a tiny fra of the power of probably whatever you're watching this on and that was crucial to allow kids to use it outside of school the screen could flip around to turn it into an eReader the thing was made of shock absorbing plastic and rubber a feature that Negron clearly very much enjoyed showing off a rubberized spillproof keyboard as well as all the ports being covered by the Wi-Fi antenni when closed all with a logo in various colors so that kids could tell their laptops apart and the absolute core of the whole thing was that the device ran on a Linux based operating system giving kids total access to the computer the organization actually managed to gather so much steam that they were even offered free Mac OS licenses by Steve Jobs himself which that never happens but Negron turned them down just to keep the system as open as possible all this for only $100 and they didn't even want to stop there we really believe that we can make literally hundreds of millions of these machines available to children around the world Negron promised and it's not just $100 it's going to go lower if you're thinking this is too good to be true good instincts and people started to pick up on this when the crank broke off at the live demo not a great start and by the time the laptop actually came out a lot of these promises had just mysteriously vanished there was no crank although I guess you can kind of see why it wasn't as durable as promised the SSD only had 1 gigabyte of storage the screen was terrible and the worst part of it was this whole project was geared around this being the $100 laptop but even with all of these quality Cuts they only managed to get the launch price down to $130 which then went up to 180 in the next revision so by the end of this all the critics were convinced that the money that had been put into this project would have been far better spent on things that people in developing nations actually want to need like you know better schools and clean drinking water 4 out of 10 fail now do you remember this little guy this alongside the Humane AI pin were literally supposed to be the next step in the evolution of personal Tech after the smartphone thanks to something called the large action model an AI system that canot just talk to you but also perform actions based on what you say like for example communicate completely on your behalf with flights and hotels to book your entire holiday from just you saying a couple of words which excited enough people to make $1 million in the first 5 days alone but spoiler alert no one would ever trust it to do that because the rabbit R1 sucks the battery sucks it requires its own SIM card if you want to use it on the go and this thing suffered from some major security vulner abilities from launch that rabbit basically ignored but the most fundamental it wasn't needed everything this thing does can already be done completely on your smartphone as well as a whole load of things that this can't which led a lot of people to ask the question sure the teenage engineering design device housing does look really cool but shouldn't this just be an app Well turns out it actually is Android authorities Michel Ramen managed to download rabbit's Launcher APK onto a Google pixel 6A and got it to run the entire R1 experience which really does make this device the final boss of this meeting could have been an email and in a similar vein of companies biting off more than they could chew my God you know huet Packard or HP if so in all likelihood it's because you've used one of their PCS in your school computer room or the library because they're affordable and they do the job they're not exactly the company you think of as the Front Runners of consumer technology however in 2011 one year after the release of the iPad HP decided it was their time to shine they wanted to take on Apple with the HP Touchpad and HP weren't stupid enough to just try and Bea at their own game they promised something different because their tablet used the web OS operating system built on the same Tech as a lot of web browsers the touchpad promised to be a more open and customizable experience than Apple's Walled Garden approach while also maintaining some of the style and flare that Apple's known for which I think is fair to say was lacking in most Android devices at the time and because web OS was based on common web technology it was supposed to be super developer friendly too now this was a very expensive move because HP had to acquire Palm who made webos for close your eyes $1.2 billion so I'm sure everyone at the company was just praying that this would pay off oh God there is absolutely no competition between how slick and intuitive the iPad interface is versus this the touchpad was pretty universally recognized as a much slower much clunkier and significantly bulkier iPad nobody wanted this thing and you know what makes it particularly embarrassing the HP was already worse than the original iPad with it being so buggy on top of everything else but to finish it all off by the time this touchpad had actually come out Apple had just launched this the iPad 2 which absolutely decimated the thing this product was performing so poorly both in terms of sales and customer experience even after slashing the price by $100 that HP literally took it off the market after only 48 days they even had to refund retailers for the stock they purchased practically soiling everyone's perception of the whole company while burning through a hell of a lot of cash while they were at it 5 out of 10 now for number seven we actually have to go all the way back to 1988 before the worldwide web if you can even imagine such a thing we're talking about a time where only 60,000 computers across fewer than 20 countries were connected to the internet which was only used by universities research centers and government bodies but then in November that year a malicious self-replicating worm program was was released from a computer MIT and 24 hours later 6,000 of those 60,000 computers had been infected and let's be very clear computers in very important places including major universities like Berkeley and Harvard and even NASA the worm used a back door in the email systems to get into these computers which wasn't very hard computers at this stage they were not ready for internet trolls and while it didn't destroy any files it rendered those systems practically unusable emails were delayed for days and functions at vital institutions including by the way the military were blocked leading to all sorts of key infrastructure having to either wipe their systems or take them offline for over a week in an attempt to rid themselves of the worm we are talking up to millions of dollars of damage with obviously the potential for much bigger consequences here's where it gets really interesting seeing the damage it had caused an anonymous programmer admitted to two friends that he was the one who created the Worm but that he hadn't intended it to spiral this much out of control he asked one of the friends to send an anonymous message across the internet which included both apologies and instructions on how to remove the Worm but ironically few people actually saw this because of the extent of the network damage the other friend went to the New York Times to try and do some damage control telling them that the worm was meant to be a harmless experiment but accidentally revealed the programmer's identity by well it wasn't very smart using his initials which were easily searchable at his university so the New York Times found and outed the culprit 23-year-old Robert tapen Morris and then the FBI got involved they quickly launched an investigation and found plenty of incriminating evidence which was used to prosecute him in 1989 and the reason this was so momentous is that Morris was the first person to ever be indicted under us congress's new 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Silver Lining though this was the wakeup call for Global cyber security only a few days after this attack the US Department of Defense set up America's first computer Emergency Response Team in Pittsburgh and now that they've woken up here is how bit Defenders new scam co-pilot our sponsor can help you to avoid the same embarrassment so this right here is a scam website they steal your data they take your money and you don't get the products you've paid for but equally how on Earth would you know this is how so my phone has the Bit Defender scam Co pilot baked into it which means that when I try and load up that same page it will stop me dangerous page blocked for your protection and it's not just for your browser this thing protects everything like for example bid Defender now pre-checks every single email and text as they come in for scam and fishing attempts before I even need to think about clicking them and there is a lot more including a live chat that lets you check just about anything else that might look a little Dodge that you're concerned about interacting with link below to get yourself the Bit Defender scam co-pilot now at least the Morris worm issues were resolved in the end though the Tesla cyber truck on the other hand has just been one continuous Rocky Road of problems ever since its very Inception where the bulletproof windows smashed during a demo to show how bulletproof they were but who would have thought that that wouldn't even be its biggest issue cuz cuz now the thing's actually out this thing has been recalled five times just this year January for a warning light font size that was too small not something I ever considered before but absolutely a real danger but thankfully they managed to fix this one remotely with an update April for a dodgy accelerator pedal which could dislodge from its pad if pushed too hard getting stuck on the throttle which if you think about it is as bad as an issue can get on a car in June Tesla had to issue two recalls on the same day because of faulty windshield wipers I mean who would have guess that the cybertruck's bizarre single 4T long wiper might not work perfectly it was failing due to excessive electrical current requiring the entire motor to be replaced and then one for the SAA pque the long strip of plastic lining on top of the sides of the bed which was poorly installed on some vehicles and has fallen off in at least two cases creating a road hazard that very much has the potential to be deadly and then finally in October due to a software issue that delays or prevents the rear view camera from showing you its feed the result over 27,000 cyber trucks have been recalled that's basically every cyber truck ever made and as of July the 8th Tesla has also been offering free motor Replacements they said it's not dangerous to drive with the old one and they haven't officially called this a recall but given that so far the Cyber truck has given people all the confidence of a wet paper bag with wheels on it I don't know how many people are going to believe that this smells like a six out of 10 fail to me and now we're in the top five now it just goes from bad to worse have you heard of Concord I'm going to guess you haven't and that's part of the problem see Concord is a video game that should have gone Gang Busters it was a hero shooter one of the most popular genres in gaming history it was developed by ex bung staff you know the people who worked on the very successful Destiny 2 and it was a PlayStation Studios game meaning that it's published by PlayStation themselves and refreshingly it was going to be a onetime $40 purchase with no battle pass or microtransactions so what what could go wrong well as soon as the first trailer dropped people immediately lost interest and that includes me I was watching the PlayStation event live when they announced this like what did I just see sure we love a good hero shooter but ever since OverWatch exploded onto the scene in 2016 the entire industry has just been pumping out clones of that game that basically do nothing new so we're at a stage now in 2024 where people are very fatigued of the genre but that's far from the full deal because the character designs were boring and also particularly aesthetically unappealing which sounds silly but a genre like this actually needs players to want to look like the heroes they're playing as especially since this entire genre revolves around unlockable skins that you want to be desirable to keep players playing the 70s sci-fi aesthetic just wasn't resonating with kids who were born 30 years later let alone the fact that it just made the entire world look like a knockoff Guardians of the Galaxy without the charm and arguably the biggest problem Sony really failed to market the game at all like this first TR trailer was 3 months before the release of the game which is probably why you've never heard of it even so I don't think anyone expected just how badly this game would perform Concord launched in August 2024 and want to guess how many concurrent players that it had at its absolute Peak on Steam to give you an idea Counter Strike 2 has nearly 2 million players Concord 697 and you know what makes it many times worse concord's been in development for 8 years and you might be thinking well surely that means the game is going to be good and according to reviews it actually was at least fun to play but what happened 8 years ago OverWatch this thing is so clearly yet another copycat trying to cash in on the genre except unlike games like paladins or valerant which have their own twists this game took so long to make that it's both completely missed the hero shooter hype window while being based on the Gen one product that in itself is now outdated I mean OverWatch 2 is already out now and even that is struggling but the single most embarrassing part of this misadventure is that Sony saw concord's poultry player numbers and decided that instead of giving this game a chance trying something new with the marketing like I don't know just off the top of my head telling people the game existed that they would shut the servers down Forever After 2 weeks of them being live they invested rumored $400 million into developing this thing which would make Concord easily PlayStation's most expensive game ever even the last was part two only cost them 220 m although there are other rumors saying that this was closer to 150 million but either way surely it was worth just risking a little bit extra just in case they could scrape some of that back easy 6 out of 10 disaster here that didn't sound good and now you can just get ready to lose all trust entirely in the ability of big companies to actually look after you starting with the snowflake hack so snowflake is a high security cloud storage provider with over 9,800 corporate customers including giants like s tand Ticket Master and AT&T so all of these massive companies will store their customers private data using Snowflake and all three of those companies were affected when a hacking group compromised snowflake in April the hacker group who call themselves the shiny Hunters which is another name for people who spend hundreds of hours in the Pokémon games searching four rare shiny versions of them got straight into the company snowflake accounts stole the data in them with the intention to sell that data off they used info stealing malware programs to infect systems not owned by snow themselves but likely devices owned by snowflakes customers companies like AT&T who would often save their snowflake login credentials on their own devices too and honestly this hack sounds like it was a whole lot easier to pull off than actually finding a shiny Pokémon people need to remember that storing your data in a locked down server is fantastic but it doesn't mean anything if the passwords to access that server are literally sitting on your desktop your security is only as good as the weakest link in your chain and yet these fruit cakes didn't even enable two-factor authentication on their machines and the impact has been that the hack has got away with 1.3 terab of personal info from 560 million Ticket Master accounts it's including full names addresses email addresses phone numbers even payment card data which they are selling for $500,000 on breach forums a notorious cyber crime platform that they own AT&T was hit even harder with info from a quote nearly all of their tens of millions of customers stolen including which numbers those customers interacted with counts of the texts and calls and total call durations for specific days or months the info from which absolutely can and very likely will be used to scam them with tools on the internet also allowing you to find the names connected to those numbers and this is the funniest part AT&T has reportedly paid the group shiny Hunters $370,000 to delete the data the only proof of which comes from a video of the shiny Hunters clicking the delete button as if they aren't a criminal organiz ation who hasn't already made a backup I'm cringing just thinking about it seven out of 10 fail so there's been a bunch of cyber attacks in this series but when your network is down because of a hacker you can at least blame it on them even if it exploited a vulnerability that you should have fixed however you know what's a lot more embarrassing is when you brick your own Tech let alone basically everyone else's do you remember in July when it felt like the entire world had a sudden it crisis well that's because of crowd strike a cyber security company who makes products to protect windows and get this over half of Fortune 500 companies rely on them this is not a small potatoes company however on July 18th crowdstrike pushed a minor update for one of their products called Falcon which is a cloud-based AI powered malware protection platform and it reaped absolute Havoc sentencing some 8.5 million PCS around the world to the infamous blue screen of death I'm talking Banks TV stations Airlines were down like Delta alone had to cancel around 7,000 flights B basically everyone who used Falcon hospitals were canceling non-urgent surgeries and even when stuff was running it was often because people had resorted to doing things by hand like this handwritten boarding pass for a flight in India in certain parts of the US even the emergency 911 number was down and it's all because Falcon's little update which happened all the time to keep up with new malware threats as the company learns about them installed code onto people's Windows computers containing a logic error which caused the devices to crash since they couldn't compute The Impossible logic and because the issue is happening on What's called the kernel level I.E accessing and editing the entire underlying system not just the surface level stuff normal apps have access to and because it was also a bootstrap driver meaning it was required for the system to boot up at all it was like the perfect cocktail to lock those PCS into an endless recovery Loop fortunately the fix turned out to be pretty simple just boot it into safe mode and delete the files associated with the problem but because of how embedded it had become in a lot of cases it required an IT professional to have physical access to the machine meaning that recovery was slow for many organizations with the disruptions causing a total of not Millions not tens of millions but 5.4 billion in direct losses for companies but this one is straight up Bonkers so Marina one was the US's first interplanetary space probe it was designed to journey to Venus equipped with various scientific instruments to allow it to record data spoiler alert it didn't get there and you're not going to believe how embarrassing the reason is the thing was supposed to fly past Venus and use these sensors to collect data about the planet keeping in contact with mission control for about 15 weeks total but after all of the work that was put into designing and constructing the craft which was composed of over 54,000 components disaster Struck it successfully lifted off on July 22nd 1962 flying nearly 100 Mil upwards for 3 and 1/ half minutes until suddenly randomly it veered off course so much so that they had to issue the self-destruct command to avoid a collision with ships in the North Atlantic the reason it happened though the hardware was absolutely fine the culprit was an unbelievably easy toiss software error a standard R was used in one equation when it should have been an R with an over bar and the reason that's so important is that the guidance computer on board that's making sure the thing is on track is constantly checking in with its sensors and the bar on top of the r is the symbol that makes sure it takes the average of Those sensors instead of just taking one reading at face value so without the correct R the probe basically start started to overcorrect its course in response to outlining data points that it should have been ignoring the project cost them around $192 million into today's money all thrown out the window because of a single typo I mean what's the most damage of typo has ever caused you could actually be pretty bad now I think about it 8 out of 10 fail the only slight Saving Grace being that they'd also already constructed Marina 2 an identical probe and because the Fatal problem was a completely avoidable human error they fixed it in about 4 seconds and Marina 2 was launched successfully just a month later and was the reason that we now know Venus rotates in the opposite direction to Earth but nothing beats the Y2 kbug who if you were born after 2000 this one's probably going to sound too insane to be true do you remember when everyone thought the world was going to end in 2012 because that was the end of a 5,000 years cycle in the ancient Mayan calendar well there was something just like that for the year 2000 only this one was grounded in the much more real fear of a tech apocalypse because it turns out that when complex computer systems were originally designed in the ' 60s computer scientists figured that they'd save what pitiful storage and Screen space that they had by using a two-digit number for the year we were very much in the 1900s after all years beginning with 18 were old news and 20 felt like too far away the problem is as the years ticked up and we got ever closer to the New Millennium people started to wonder are computers actually going to understand that 00 means 2,000 not, 1900 and you might think that the only real consequence of that would be waking up on New Year's morning thinking hey that's funny the clock's just gone back 100 years there were real reasons to be worried because as you've seen with the marina small miscalculations with the input of a computer can have major consequences with the output and in this case industries that relied on computer track dates could be affected in huge ways like Banks which track interest daily could potentially suddenly calculate interest atus 99 years and places like power plants which track routine safety checks of things like radiation levels could pose a threat to human life if these checks were missed people even started panicking that planes might start falling from the sky and that people's pacemakers would just stop that old Uncle Joe would just collapse and die the second that you go from one to happy New Year at your party so governments raced to avert a potential computer crisis rushing to update anything and everything to a four-digit date and I mean everything I don't think anyone quite expected just how much would be spent on this you know how some companies in this fails List have lost hundreds of Millions here an estimated 200 to 600 billion was spent to tackle the issue and that's in the 1990s and when you think about it that is a catastrophic amount of money to burn considering that it could have been avoided by a few computer scientists typing two more characters n out of 10 thankfully the steps taken did avert widespread chaos but the few issues that did still occur proved that the worry was warranted for example on January 1st 2000 many computers did think they woke up in 1900 forcing 15 nule reactors across the world to shut down some people who did in fact incur a 100-year bank loan interests and hilariously One customer at a New York video rental store who was handed a bill of $91,200 yes for having rented a movie for 100 years I'll catch you in the next fails video right here"

'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program']",True,hidden amongst these snow covered Hills is a secretive institution home to a revolutionary machine that can harness physics so strange it sounds like magic this is IBM's research facility it's where some of the biggest breakthroughs in the history of computer science have happened and probably going to be home to a few more because this is where they build quantum computers their potential is huge promising breakthroughs in Material Science medicine fundamental physics and more but there is a dark side because they will come with the ability to decrypt all internet communication experts say there is now a Quantum arms race between the United States and its biggest economic rival China I'm Professor Hannah fry mathematician and writer I want to know where Quantum technology will take us and with International Security under threat who will come out on top [Music] this is the research headquarters for one of the oldest companies in Tech IBM they've been inventing new Computing technology here since the 1960s it's like the Jetson meets The [Music] Flintstones Quantum scientist Olivia Lanes is showing me IBM's newest experimental machine this big shiny Behemoth is IBM Quantum system 2 sounds like it's on what is the big deal there I mean why not just build an ordinary supercomputer it's a totally different avenue it's not just supercomputers but better or AI but more powerful it's entirely different way of computing the big difference is the computer's ability to harness the mysterious ious effects of quantum physics standard computers they calculate by using billions of tiny little on andof switches known as bits now these things they're very reliable they're very accurate and they work together in sequence so if you ask a standard computer to solve a maze it will do so by checking through every possible path one by one until it finds a solution now depending on the size of the maze that could take seconds or minutes or potentially for a really big maze even years a quantum computer on the other hand Works a little bit differently there the bits are known as Quantum bits or qits and rather than just being on or off a cubit can be held in something called a super position where it can be both on and off at the same time now okay I know that that doesn't really make a lot of sense but unfortunately that is just how physics Works down at the atomic level so go with me this bizarre ability of a cubit to be in two states at once means that a series of cubits can solve lots of calculations simultaneously and so if you ask a quantum computer to solve a maze it means it can consider all possible routs at once giving you the answer in an instant it could allow a quantum computer to complete in minutes computation so complex that it would take today's supercomputers millions of years but that's not the only reason they're a GameChanger for science I think what it really comes down to is that nature is quantum mechanical when you get down to molecular and atomic interactions nature does not obey classical physics it's just a very crude approximation and if we really want to understand how nature evolves in time we have to have a system that obeys quantum physics so I guess this finally gives us the opportunity to do simulations down at the level of atoms and when you have that I mean you can design drugs at the level of atoms that's right and design materials batteries and we haven't had this before we've never had that I think when Quantum Computing comes up in conversation people are excited about it but they're excited about the the amount of power it gives you about how quickly you can do computations because okay sure all of that stuff might be true but we should be thinking of this as though someone has just invented the telescope and all of a sudden we can see and understand things at a scale that we just did not have access to before that's the ambition at least quantum computers cannot yet perform useful calculations better than a supercomputer because in practice getting even a handful of cubits to give you a reliable answer is phenomenally difficult now you got oh my God whoa this is IBM's lab where they test out new hardware a place where we can see the guts of the machine oh that is extraordinary this is what system to looks like inside yeah what are we looking at then I think a lot of of people have a slight misconception and they see you know this whole gold shiny thing they think this is a quantum computer that's actually not true this is the quantum computer so this tiny little thing right this is the Heron chip this is the 133 cubits that I am holding in the palm of my hand how much is that worth a lot don't drop it I'm going to try not to the chip contains the cubits that carry out the computation and it's fair to say they're a little fussy we're trying to change the energy state of the Cubit between zero and one in a very controlled way so any type of outside energy that might change it slightly in a way except for what we're trying to do will break your algorithm and give you the wrong answer outside energy includes any heat to preserve the delicate Quantum state of the Cubit the chip must be kept extremely cold this tangle of goldplated pipes and wires is in fact a cooling system that chills the chip to just above absolute zero for comparison the cosmic microwave background in space is way warmer that's orders of magnitude warmer oh my goodness so it is the coldest thing in the known universe which is incomprehensibly C but these these guys like it they like it focus on your work stop paying attention to any of the energy around you that's right IBM say they'll unlock quantum's full potential by 2033 as you can imagine it's been an expensive Endeavor do you have any idea how much IBM will have spent on this Quantum program uh we haven't broken out but I think it's fair to say it's like obviously many billions of dollars of investment you know our company spends close to $7 billion a year in R&D right and today in our world of technology if you're not investing at that scale is very hard to be a global leader but you do have competition right how much are you looking over your shoulder at what everyone else is doing oh we pay Keen attention right to the entire ecosystem but look we take the perspective because we've been sort of leaders and Pioneers of these field is that we want an industry like we don't want to be you know alone on this how much do you collaborate with with other companies though like Google and Microsoft who are also in this space we collaborate a lot uh externally for us collaborating on is is like at the heart of making an ecosystem it's back to the idea of creating an industry do you collaborate with Chinese companies as well no we do not oh go on well I think we we acknowledge the fact that in this technology uh in Quantum right but we're seeing it happen by the way in other areas like semiconductors and so on there is not only a big economic uh Dimension but there's a big National Security implication as well Quantum Falls squarely Within the category of like sensitive Technologies from from that perspective how important is it for the US to be the the leaders in this it's critically important I I but and I think that that is recognized in a bipartisan manner one of the things we're witnessing is that we've seen the elevation of technology to the same level of geostrategic importance as trade or military alliances Quantum Computing is without a doubt one of the top technologies that the United States needs to lead for now the United States maintains Supremacy in the development of quantum computers but its biggest rival is fast catching up China are betting big they've invested over $15 billion more than three times any other country they have dozens of new research institutes committed to Quantum and hold more than half of all patents in Quantum technology hey hi there how you doing security expert Anna Pugi has been advising the US government on how not to fall behind China really does view Science and Technology as a National Asset it talks about not leading not just leading but dominating in these key areas does the US not see science as a National Asset as well I don't think we have the same kind of comprehensive strategic plan that brings together all facets of society and really has that longer term investment what we are facing is it's not an even and Level Playing Field our researchers are essentially up against the funding of a nation state what are we talking about here in terms of the magnitude of difference of funding some examples that folks have given me is okay I have a lab I have five to six maybe four to six graduate students in my lab at any given time there the equivalent Labs have you know 50 100 graduate students or postdocs the US is hitting back I've made sure that the most advanced American Technologies can't be used in China and thanks to our chips and science act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before whoever is the first to realize the potential of quantum computers will wield incredible power but it's a double-edged sword because a world with quantum computers could be a world without Secrets pretty much all internet communication is based on scrambling it using a secret code otherwise known as encryption and a lot of it uses a very clever mathematical trick involving in prime numbers what we do you take two prime numbers let's say 17 and 31 and then you multiply them together to give you a code in this case 527 now that bit is very straight forward very easy for computers to do that multiply numbers together what is much harder is if you only have the long number working out what those two secret primes were the only way that you can do with classical computers is by checking through all the prime numbers just to see if they work one after the other after the other a common type of encryption RSA uses prime numbers that are hundreds of digits long to crack those codes it would take a conventional computer trillions of years that's really the Obstacle of encryption it's not it's impossible just takes a really really long time this is where Quantum Computing comes in because quantum computers using superposition can simultaneously run numerous calculations at the same time and can take something like this down to being crackable within just a few minutes it means that encrypted data could be hacked in no time few are more afraid of a mass global data breach than the banking industry Dr Philip inura is head of quantum technology at HSBC we process3 3.5 trillion pounds worth of payments every year so cryptography is a big deal for us how much of a catastrophe would this be if if people just sat back and did nothing Well ultimately you're going to have customers accounts being breached which means things like identity theft and forgent transactions being stolen money being stolen um that's then going to roll into Financial losses customers will lose money the banks will lose money but I think ultimately the biggest risk of all is the the element of trust if customers can't trust their Bank to keep their um accounts and their money secure as well as their data then it's kind of an existential risk yeah I mean that is a fundamental part of banking can you be absolutely sure that this hasn't happened already I mean okay if I had a quantum computer I could read everything I'm not sure I would tell people about it no you probably wouldn't I think it's very unlikely that anyone's got a quantum computer powerful enough right now to do this but there may be something called a store now decrypt later or harvest now decrypt later type of attack and and this is kind of the idea that um State actors or malicious entities right now can start intercepting our data and storing it and just keeping it ready um for the time the point in time when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives are we talking about National Security consent here is that is that that ultimately where the big worry is that's probably the the number one area um that we should be concerned about because um you know State actors are most likely going to Target uh National Security kind of infrastructure to to scrape and the cipher information State Secrets will be uncovered um you'll know who all the spies are you'll know who all the spies are if you suddenly um lose that secrecy and that security then it causes all sorts of vulnerabilities on a person level on a national level from a security perspective from a commercial perspective and so you know this is a big big deal HSBC say that doing nothing is simply not an option the bank has been testing a way to secure its data against an attack from quantum computers internet data today is sent by laser pulses in an optical fiber this is Dr Andrew Shields head of quantum technology for toiba in general fiber networks are very secure um but they are vulnerable to um tapping if I introduce a small band into the fiber you can see some of the light is not leaking out and actually a hacker can use that they can introduce a small band to tap out some of the light and measure that to uh recover the data so that's all you need then is just access to the cable indeed it's very straightforward Goodness Me Andrew has built a device that utilizes The Strange World of quantum physics to send data in a way he claims can never be hacked it's called Quantum key distribution this is it this is it yes what this box is doing is it's sending single photons through an optical fiber into the BT Network and we use that to form encryption keys and those encryption keys are then been used to secure data s between here and the data center in barkshire the device generates a secret code using single particles of light photons which are sent one at a time down a fiber optic cable a fundamental law of quantum physics is that if You observe a photon you change its Quantum State and that means that if an eavesdropper tries to intercept the key the code will be changed rendering it unusable the device already uses Telecom company BT's existing fiber Network to send sensitive files across London to a data center over 30 miles away tell me about the information that you're sending using this method at the moment then so in the case of HSBC it's financial data but we've done other trials with hospitals for instance where they've been sending medical scan data um or with um governments where they've been sending some government data do you feel this sense of urgency from companies then even though we're not quite there yet with quantum computers yes they absolutely are there's an increasing um realization that the quantum computer is coming how far away do you reckon it is uh well now that's a very difficult question um to answer if I was a betting man maybe I would say um 5 to seven years there are no May here it's not if this is going to happen it's when it's going to happen and it's the total acceptance that when it happens our existing communication systems are no longer fit for purpose and that puts you in a position where you have no choice no choice but to find something else that works and is secure some have made more progress than others in 2016 China shocked the World by launching a satellite capable of sending quantum Keys over far greater distances than fiber optics it's part of a wider quantum network that China has built connecting Banks government and Industry across the country leaving other nations scrambling to catch up on the gleaming streets of Singapore the quantum revolution has found fertile ground scientists here want to build an unhackable Network that can be commercialized so anyone can use it Professor Alexander Ling runs the center for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore a government funded group of scientists working on all sorts of quantum technology they told me uh that I would get to see some Nano satellites okay I think this is even more Nano than I was expecting this is over 200 times lighter than China's Quantum satellite okay tell me about the experiment then what's the big aim the Big Goal over here is we want to build a global network uh where we can actually distribute Quantum signals around the world we can distribute Quantum signals using optical fiber except that there's a distance limit to it um we can't repeat those Quantum signals so we we think that if you have Satellites with optical fiber networks uh you can actually you know build a more comprehensive Network around the world so then when you send up a rocket you presumably have like a number of days you sort of put them out where you yes yes what we're doing in Singapore is to test whether similar technology can go on much smaller satellites you can imagine that if it works you can have a fleet of smaller satellites that's more cost effective and that makes the deployment of such a system uh more likely his plan is to fire single photons into space and Back Again via a network of satellites and telescopes these Quantum Keys would provide unhackable Global Communications so this is your fancy Photon catcher that's right this is a telescope that's going to receive the signals from the satellite long-distance communication is just one part of Professor Ling's work they also collaborate with us and Chinese companies Quantum technology was developed in an era when international relations was more relaxed and put it that way you know it started in the you know late 80s early '90s and everyone was open to you know having an exchange of people and ideas at that time has that desire for collaboration continued or has it been sort of shut down a bit more because of the geopolitical situation we find ourselves in I think definitely everyone's aware that there's tension geopolitical tensions and people from time to time talk about export controls and things like that everybody you know seems to have high expectations for when Quantum technology will deliver you know those benefits uh if you come in with controls too early before a lot of the problems are worked out you are probably going to be pushing the know the date of deployment the date when you see those benefits much further into the future I'm kind of squashing The Innovation as it's happening that's fine scientists understand how quantum computers could supercharge their discoveries Banks and governments see the risks and the potential for economic growth but will a high stakes duel for Supremacy really Define the future of global power I think the rhetoric around this is always framed as a Quant race right between two giant superpowers who are throwing everything they have at it but I sort of don't think that this is like races that we've had before I don't think this is like the space race or the nuclear arms race because I don't think that we're in a situation where you can only have one winner the quantum future is about building a scientific tool that allows us to see and understand the universe down at the level of atoms in a way that we have just never had access to before and okay maybe I'm just being optimistic but I think that that is something that all of humanity will stand to benefit from [Music] [Music]
6jVUSsByq9Y,The BEST Smartphones of 2024!,Which is the best phone of 2024? Samsung? Apple iPhone? Xiaomi? Google?... or someone else? Only the first 30 purchases ...,Mrwhosetheboss,2024-11-29T11:13:15Z,28,"['best', 'smartphones', 'apple', 'google', 'iphone', 'samsung', 'pixel', '2024', '2025']",PT20M45S,4083822,10515,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"2024 is the year that AI has taken over the smartphone World it feels like that's all every company wants to talk about ai ai with AI Galaxy ai ai so let's see where it's made a big difference where it's made no difference at all and we actually going right Back to Basics has paid off even better welcome to the best smartphones of 2024 and while we're at it also the worst smartphones that you should not buy we've got 10 categories and it's all leading up to the one true overall Champion so given that 2024 has been a total AI arms race who is actually winning that race well as far as apple is concerned most of their AI features are absent especially in Europe and the few that are here are good but not enough to ignore that feeling of is that it I'd say Google's AI is better I love some of the photography stuff that the Google pixel's got going on like you know that Zoom inhance feature that's practically just an upgrade button for your shots and I thought Gemini live this instant free flowing AI chat was kind of amazing but then chat gbt has now just started doing the same thing and in my experience that's better and so ultimately Samsung takes it Samsung AI came out first it was already pretty interesting and they've only made it more stable and given it more options since then like I have actually used some of their stuff like the live text translations on a day-to-day basis so given that the s24 ultra is Samsung's kind of hero device this year this trophy has that phone's name on it I'm actually so happy with how these turned out can you see how this isn't just a flat photo of the phone too we actually went and got the full 3D model of every phone here laser etched into these trophies front back and sides just like my haircut very fun the most improved phone this year has a very obvious answer so last year Google released what looked an awful lot like an offseason April Fool Stoke with the Google pixel fold these screen bezels in this crease for this price and the thing barely even folded flat when you opened it unsurprisingly this this was one of the worst phones of 2023 oh my God I actually forgot how bad this crease was but this year the new Google pixel 99 Pro fold is well it's infinitely better at everything apart from the name like what is this the software has come a long way as you'd expect between a gen one and gen 2 product and they've actually Justified paying the extra to buy a foldable this time but also the hardware the crazy bezels are gone it's thinner it's lighter it's faster it's brighter if someone were to tell me they went out and bought this thing I wouldn't be holding in a laugh anymore and that is a compliment I like this thing and as usual if any company wants these Awards just message us and we'll send them and now we're on the subject of foldable phones what's the best foldable in the world ever well honestly I'm kind of bummed about this last year we saw something special with the OnePlus open affordable with zero camera compromise amazing battery and software that actually made even people who'd completely written foldables off reconsider however they did not upgrade it this year yeah well they they kind of did they made this OnePlus open Apex Edition which does sound very cool it has more storage it has a dedicated VIP security chip which can quickly cut an app's access to your camera and microphone and this fancy new red color but it's powered by last year's chip it's really hard to recommend that you pay full whack pricing this year for something that really should be heavily discounted by now and so I spent quite a lot of time deliberating between the Samsung Galaxy zold 6 and the Google pixel 9 Pro f eventually deciding that it's just personal preference between the two the pixel is thinner and it feels a bit more like a normal phone when folded and then the Samsung has about 50% more power but neither of these phones are actually taking home the trophy so funny story I actually did some very detailed testing until I decided which phone won I got as far in the process as to actually make a trophy saying that the Samsung Galaxy Z fold 6 was the winner but that's because there was one phone that I hadn't tested until that point and that is the honor magic V3 I got this thing a couple of weeks ago but we won't be needing this anymore for starters this thing is so pretty the faux leather back the texture trim on the spine it's got small bezels on both the outside and the inside basically no crease oh yeah and the phone is paper thin it really is a spectacle but then where this starts to get almost confusing is instead of that size reduction being achieved by chopping out everything on the inside it's just better this has got a far bigger battery than Samsung it also has stylus support it charges faster they even fit in a proper Periscope zoom camera so the true winner of the foldable category the only thing that's a little bit less developed is the foldable software Samsung can do a bit more with a little bit more polish but this Hardware feels so much better that frankly I don't really care with these smaller flip phones though I think it's actually between Samsung and Motorola I think Motorola's razor plus is actually the prettier phone like the cover screen is more impressive and it feels like they've thought more purposefully about what you can actually do with it but ultimately Samsung just has better fundamentals it is the significantly more powerful phone Samsung software skin is more reliable and you get way more updates plus you get Samsung's very optimized image processing which does also make this the better camera now it's not just OnePlus who's bowed out this year because the other iconic line of phones that's notably absent is the compact Asus Zen phones and it seems strange year after year Asus released these super compact but high-end phones and year after year people labeled them as the gold standard for their diminutive size but I think the Crux of it is this when most people are shopping for a smartphone the primary limiting factor is budget we want to get the most product for that budget but you can't do that if you're also working with a size constraint there's a reason that the iPhone minis failed so what's left then well I really like the Samsung Galaxy s24 it's a very light very small allrounder you get Samsung's AI which as we've seen is the best but the battery and the cameras while solid aren't great for this Flagship tier so then youve got the Google pixel 9 Pro which has good battery life and great cameras Google's really neatened up their game in 2024 especially with their Flagship phones but I would go as far as to say that none of those beats the xiaomi 14 kind of reaching the limits of how far I can stretch with a suit this tight this thing isn't quite as mini as the s24 but it's not far off and it has topnotch cameras it's just so fun to shoot with cuz it Doesn't for once feel like you're getting the sloppy camera seconds from the Ultra phone like it definitely does with the Samsung Also the battery does last a really long time for such a small phone so here it is on the plimp xiaomi did well me that was disgusting now there are two things that I would flag software wise you get four years of software updates here as opposed to seven on Samsung and not everyone loves xiaomi's hyper OS operating system it does feel a little bit like a knockoff iOS but if that doesn't matter to you then it is fast and it is customizable the second thing though is that slightly awkward fact that xiaomi has actually already released the xiaomi 15 but they just have this extremely delayed process getting those new phones to the west but what if you just want a phone that lasts forever well 2024 has actually been a particularly good year for this Android 14 has improved basically every Flagship phone's battery life by 10% plus and apple specifically made battery one of the key key things they focused on with the iPhone 16s but if you're asking who does it the best then that would have to be Vivo now I never got around to making a dedicated video on this bad boy but let me tell you vivo's flagship phone for 2024 the Vivo X200 Pro is an absolutely mind-blowing phone its specs Feel Like A Cut Above the Rest and that's only Amplified when you use the thing because it's so damn optimized but I'm going to talk more about this later for the purposes of right now just know that this thing isn't one of those mediocre mid-rangers strapped to an absolutely Bonkers siiz battery it's an incredible phone in its own right with a 6,000 Mah cell that actually uses that insane amount of juice very efficiently too so this was a pretty easy one for me and I just want to mention while we're on the topic there are two ways that I could have done this whole trophy thing and I spent a while going back and forth on which one was the way to go cuz the thing is Vivo is pretty tricky to buy in the UK and the US which are two of our three top viewing regions so some part of me was thinking should I just stick to rewarding the phones that you can easily buy and get your full customer support maybe but eventually I decided that I don't see these videos as just a buying guide this this is an awards ceremony So eventually I decided it would feel silly to not celebrate the phones and the Innovation that I actually feel deserves it just because they're not made for certain markets all right final few categories now before we get to the overall winners and of course tonight's big loser what is the best phone for gaming can we get some rgbs in here well I would say there's three runners up there's the obvious yearly phone from red magic which is lost in the SE somewhere which like all red magic phones has absolutely beautiful Hardware especially for the money but they need to improve their software and their front camera before I can Crown them the best then also the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra they both have really good screens very fast chips good cooling basically all you need for a Flawless gaming experience in most cases but there is a clear leader of the pack if you so desire it is the Rog phone 9 Pro for two reasons this has the brand new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip inside of it which is topend nextg I don't know quite how they got it in here so soon but you can think of this as next year's Flagship chip it's like a proper 30% faster than the chips in the rest of these phones but it's also Rog have really mellowed out over the years the software is less iny face gamer than it used to be while actually hiding more gamer Fe features than ever before the design has got that cool gamery Edge to it like this pixel display is the best that they've done so far without looking Tucky the cameras are the best they've ever been you get a proper 50 megapix main camera a pretty good three times optical zoom camera and a serviceable ultroid camera so if you do want to properly sink your teeth into Mobile gaming it's not close this thing is amazing my only slight beef is that they have had to tone down the speaker quality a bit from their old phones to make the bezels around the screen smaller but we can't have everything this is a banging phone okay so that's gaming what is the best camera of 2024 you would expect this to be easy I compared what I thought with the two best smartphone cameras the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra and I found that the iPhone 1 so iPhone right well that was before I tested the vi X200 Pro the way that I would describe this is technically speaking the iPhone is a fantastic camera I don't think I've ever taken a photo or video on this thing thinking that sucks it shoots exactly what you think it's going to but when I use this phone the oh that's not good I promise these are really durable trophies my wife comes to save the day I just break things okay let's put what's left of this trophy on the plint we'll have to get a new one of these made but the point I was making is when I use this phone it makes me feel like I can capture things that I never thought I could it just bleeds style it's got a big main camera sensor it's got a 200 megapixel zoom camera which means you can get a lot closer to things than you think an absolutely amazing portrait mode that makes me feel like I could do this as a career and even the video quality is probably the best that I have seen on Android so even though the phone is not as widely available as others you got to give credit where credits due or I guess in this case broken trophies I either want this in the west or I want Western companies to be more like this the only downside of shooting with Vivo of course is that you've still got to keep an eye on what you're shooting you don't even need to do that with our sponsor the insta 360 X4 because look at this if I attach this camera onto the invisible selfie stick and then I place it in the middle of this basketball CT wa I always forget how tall this thing is then I don't need to think about anything anymore it records an 8K resolution it records in 360° so you can capture every single part of this game all at once and then if I later decided that I wanted a completely different Viewpoint of that same scene I can tap on Josh's face instead of mine and voila the camera follows him all the way around instead but here's the coolest part if you really decide that you want to flex today you can swing the camera around your head to capture these frankly insane matrix-like bullet time shots in which the camera and all equipment around it disappears oh and there's an exclusive holiday deal so it's 15% off the X4 it's a free bullet time handle like this and it's a free invisible selfie stick all from the link in the description so that's all the subcategories let's talk winners so the best budget phone of 2024 as per usual there's been a billion of them all the usual contenders there's great phones from redmi there's great phones from real me great phones from Poco but there's one phone that to me feels special and that is the cmf phone one cuz here's the thing it's got the specs that you'd be looking for at this $200 price nothing feels lacking when you're using it but it combines that with a pretty big practicality upside the thing is modular and it has an entire ecosystem of accessories just to go with it and yeah not in a super slick everything's magnetic and wirelessly communicates kind of way but it's the best it can be given the price and it's far more than anyone else is doing it means you damage your phone's back you can just swap it out you want to add in a phone stand just screw one in you want a wallet you can have one completely secured to the rear of your device oo I feel like this trophy's turned out particularly cool but while the best budget phone was a pretty easy decision the best mid-range phone was not sleepless nights I tell you sleepless nights you know that Meme I bet he's thinking about other girls yeah that's me but all I could think of was xiaomi Samsung no no no Google OnePlus oh nothing anyway there were a couple of options that were easier to eliminate like the Google pixel 8A which is a little underpowered for what you're paying doesn't have that great a battery and also just looks kind of bad for a 2024 mid-range phone with these thick and uneven screen borders the nothing phone 2 is well it's last year's phone and they haven't made a nothing phone 3 yet but now it gets tricky because I think this phone the OnePlus Nord 4 is absolutely amazing it's been a long time since I've used a metal body phone this thing takes me all the way back to the HTC 1 days and those were good times it's one of those phones that you pick up and you're just like yes you get it this works it's thin it's light it's fast pretty much everything about it feels Flagship and and it stands shockingly close to phones like the Samsung Galaxy s24 plus but at less than half the price the only thing that puts me off giving it the trophy is that the ultra wide camera is really quite soft and there is no zoom camera but genuinely if this company had just invested another $30 in this camera system this would have been my favorite phone for sure so this ended up for me being a decision between the Samsung Galaxy s24 Fe which is Samsung's slightly scaled back s24 plus phone and then the xiaomi 14t which is pretty similar it's xiaomi's mid-range equivalent to their Flagship 14 series of phones and honestly when you put these two side by side the s24 Fe does feel pretty lazy by comparison it does have a faster chip and it does have wireless charging which the xiaomi doesn't but it just feels like xiaomi has put a lot more care into their device the 14t has got a higher resolution screen a larger battery faster charging more RAM even just comparing the screen bezels xiaomi feels definitively ahead not to mention this is the standard 14t which is quite a lot cheaper than Samsung once you get to the 14t pro which is more similar it absolutely smokes it also I was expecting Samsung zoom camera to be significantly better than xia since this is a three times optical zoom and this is a two times optical zoom but when I tested it and I found that it wasn't I looked up the specs only to find that xiaomi zoom camera has a 50 megap resolution Samsung's has eight which just feels really rough for something of this price and now just before the over overall phone of the Year someone has to take the L last year it was Apple with the iPhone SE and Google with their first pixel fold both very prolific devices that the whole industry knew were coming this year we have something that I don't think anyone saw coming really so hmd the company who you most likely know for their Nokia phones they decided this time around to make something called the skyline and um horrendously mediocre device I mean first of all whose idea was this design who decided that the combination of a Sharp angular body and then a rounded screen was the way to go you literally picked the worst parts of both decisions and merg them together into a phone that looks even worse than the sum of its parts the thing literally looks like you started cutting out the approximate shape of a smartphone and then halfway through realized that you couldn't actually be bothered the cameras sound good on paper but the tuning is bad you have to work to get great images out of it and you don't get like the 7 years of software support of Samsung or even the four years of shiai you get two here and if that wasn't enough it gets pretty laggy fairly often it's got this horrible tiny vibration motor put it this way I'm not surprised that you can already get this thing for like 30 to 40% off even though it's only been out for a few months hardly manages to deliver which is why we need to give it its own wooden spoon okay so what is the best flagship phone of 2024 if you just truly want the best of the best well honestly I think the OnePlus 12 is absolutely amazing for slightly less money than the rest the Google pixel 9 Pro XL is very good for people who are a bit less into gaming and more into AI supercharged photography but this has felt like a particularly great year for Samsung software they've gone quite suddenly from having one of the weakest software skins to one of the strongest and so even though not every piece of Hardware they've made this year has been a hit their topend s24 Ultra does come out as a very immediate top Contender some of their Samsung AI stuff is actually useful battery life is amazing the S Pen is physically baked inside and also this anti-reflective display theyve put onto it is amazing don't underestimate it and all of this is happening while I would go as far as to say apple has floundered even though yes the iPhone camera does come out on top aside from that the battery improvements were not significant basically no other Hardware changed and the key new thing is Apple intelligence which is both very early right now and also coming to last year's Pros anyway also I don't really like iOS 18 I feel like the two key things that have changed are one the control center which makes zero sense to me I just don't understand how Apple decided that the key thing their users want in the next update is a full screen music widget even though they have a music widget here and then you scroll down another page and you've just got an expanded list of the same controls that you also still have on your homepage page why and then you got the new photos app which is just beyond confusing and slower to navigate and so while obviously choosing a phone nowadays is highly based on ecosystem if we just put that to the side who made the best phone this year I would say Samsung until I tested this Vivo I wish the body of this phone was a little less sticky but apart from that vivo's origin OS is so fast so smooth like I said before the camera is shockingly good it's like the best parts from every phone camera put together and the battery is amazing when I use this phone it genuinely feels like I've just inserted a cheat code and have Early Access to next year's device it it feels naughty and so it brings me great pleasure to announce that the overall champion of 2024 is in fact the Vivo X200 Pro the bad news is it's not easy to get hold of in countries like the UK and the US the good news is that if this phone really appeals to you then the Oppo Find X 8 Pro is really similar and much easier to get it's the same parent company making both and so the core DNA behind them is pretty much identical to find out how we've turned this room that we're sitting in right now into the perfect living room click here and I will catch you in the next one"

YX8ks42Azn8,The TRIPLE FOLDING phone has a Problem.,This phone has a LOT of good....and a LOT of bad... Only the first 30 purchases can enjoy my Exclusive Holiday Offer: a 15% ...,Mrwhosetheboss,2024-10-26T14:06:50Z,28,[],PT12M54S,3951747,6169,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"this right here is the Huawei mate XT I spent over $5,000 to get one it's the world's first triple folding phone the thing is kind of mind-blowing but as I've started to dig deeper I realized there is also something sinister going on with it so this is how the thing comes presented iPhone box size reference W there's no doubt about it this is absolutely incredible so right on top here are the Huawei free buds 5 I gave these things a 7 out of 10 when I tested all the band Huawei products got a car charger 8 watts pluming NE that's generous but then I suppose equally at the same time this is the kind of experience that you would expect anyone who's willing to pay thousands of dollars for a first generation product is a true fan and Huawei needs to make sure that those fans are looked after so in here we got tips for the earphones a bunch of papers and then a carbon fiber case okay we'll come back to this what's in here oh what so you got the mains charger which is only 66 WS how do you have a Mains charger with less power than the car charger and not one but two cables a USBC to USBC and then a USBC to usba a now before the whole we didn't even need onefold why on Earth would we need twofold Army comes to get me hear me out because there is something I think is absolutely amazing about this ever since the very first foldable phones we have had a problem I think it's fair to say that most people are interested in the idea of a phone that could become a tablet at the snap of their fingers a massive screen to watch movies or play your games on but the reason that very few people follow through and actually buy these folding phones like the ones from Samsung is price aside if you want to make it usable while it's folded it's got to be tall like a phone but then that means that when you open it it's got to be square and because videos and games are all designed to be widescreen it barely makes your experience bigger than just using a normal phone and so the only thing left for foldable is to be better at crazy multitasking but that's Niche and just be honest most people who could afford one of these already have a laptop or a proper tablet for that anyway but that is where this Huawei comes in so you open once from here and yeah in this form it is basically the same as a normal foldable AKA pretty useless for most types of content but look what happens when we open one more time the extra width from this one extra fold is an absolute GameChanger I mean like this is an iPad it's widely considered one of the best devices for catching up with your m movies on an airplane but now we have a phone that gives you practically the same viewable screen area when watching content except this one folds into something resembling this what year are we living in and what Huawei has done to achieve this is actually just as cool so this is Samsung zold 5 and when folded it is 13.4 mm thick Samsung's very latest is 12.1 mm huawei's triple folding phone is just 12.8 they've crumbed in a whole extra layer this is like 2D versus 3D while barely making the phone thicker at all and what that means is when the thing is unfolded this is 3.6 mm thick obviously it is easier to make things thinner when you have more space this way but 3.6 I did a video a few years ago on the thinnest smartphone in the world and that was 4.75 and the current iPhone is 8.3 for reference it genuinely feels like some sort of sci-fi movie prop and I can't quite believe this is a final product you know where it really hits home just how slim this is is when you realize that every single port button and cutout looks like it barely fits on the device not to mention that you can really tell they've put some love into this design like can you see this gold accent ring around the camera well that is apparently handd designed with almost 80 layers of stacked steel very much like actually those highly prized Damascus knives and what it means is that every single phone looks just a little bit different and that's cool so is this what foldable phones should have been like all along is this what Samsung should be making starting from next year Well it certainly looks that way on first glance cuz let's say that I'm using a normal bold folding phone I could use it in one hand like this I could use it in two hands like this or I could use it on a table and it's half folded state but what can you do on this well for starters you've got the normal phone mode you got the screen on the front you got the camera on the back this is effectively the same as using a normal folded phone folded up so then you open it up and again functionally at this point we are still identical with what you get with a normal folding phone and also like a normal folding phone you can use the screen that's currently facing the back to allow the person you're shooting to see themselves and also to allow you to take high quality selfies using your phone's rear set of cameras damn that looks good but then you get the third screen involved and this way you can start to do some very interesting stuff like you can use two screens to watch what you're doing while using the third screen to angle your camera you could actually have two screens to work on and then use the bottom screen folded up like that as a stand and then you add this case into the mix which in itself already has a stand that can rotate to any angle that you want it to and you start to think to yourself I can use this phone however I can think to use this phone this is what I mean when I say that the extra screen here is like the difference between 2D and 3D because the possibilities aren't just additive they are multiplicative and they've managed to do all of this without even sacrificing on the cameras I mean you can probably tell by the fact that this camera bump is half the thickness of the phone but this is on the upper end of foldable phone cameras and even though it is somewhat early days on the software like not that many things are fully optimized for three screens it does feel like they have thought about the user experience like for example when you want to unlock the pin screen comes up on the side that you swipe up with so this is interesting enough that yes I would love to see what Samsung and xiaomi and other foldable firm makers can do with this type of form factor cuz while it does create a number of issues in itself they're all solvable and what it does is it fixes the one big one and actually makes foldables useful for the masses now that is not to say that Huawei gets a free pass because while the trifold design could work this specific attempt at one does not I mean the smaller issues are already something there's the fact that yes there is absolutely a honeymoon phase with this where you wake up every day with a spring in your step you turn over to your wife sorry phone you open it and you Marvel at how on Earth Huawei fit this much device into 3.6 mm of thickness when unfolded but as the days go on you come to another realization that because this thing is now twice as much effort to unfold you're going to end up using it a lot more just like this and when you use it folded up like this you're basically just holding a brick phone that happens to weigh 300 G cuz even though the thing isn't much thicker than normal phones it's the hinges having to have two hinges on this means that a higher proportion of the device has to be made of densely compacted metal and speaking of hinges they don't fold both ways so the front folds outwards whereas the rear folds inwards and if you get that wrong even once with a little too much pressure well it will still fold just irreversibly I've seen this happen enough times that I have decided I won't be the guy who tries it and it ain't just the hinges you also have to be very careful with the screen folding phone screens are much easier to scratch than normal phone screens and there are lots of situations when using this where you have to to expose some parts of this pressure screen to the elements and on that note how precious well you know that I paid $5,000 which is obviously not the retail price of this thing it's the I managed to scalp one and sell it on eBay for profit price but even the retail price in China where it's mainly on sale is $22,800 or $3,400 for the top spec model and because this screen is such a unique component the repair costs for this piece alone are $11,000 and even when you're not looking after the screens you're looking at the creases on them do you notice they're actually not the worst we've seen but by no means invisible well that's partly because when you add more hinges you can't make each hinge as good a good hinge that doesn't crease the display takes up valuable space and since the entire priority here is to compress the design as much as possible something's got to give but as I was saying all of these issues potentially solvable and to be fair expected when you're trying something that's this different none of this stuff makes this phone a write off there is a deeper Huawei problem and I'm not even talking about the over 50 pre-installed apps or the fact that if you want to do literally anything Google you have to do it via one of these Shady applications that try to convince Google you're not coming from a Huawei phone like the most common one is Gbox which signs into Google by identifying as a Samsung Galaxy a22 I know because I got the email confirmation for it here's the thing if you've watched any Huawei launch events recently you'll have seen that Richard U who leads them keeps saying that Huawei is far ahead of its competitors this company feels hyper aware of what Apple and Samsung are doing and wants to make it very publicly clear to Chinese citizens that those companies are slacking in comparison and you might look at something like this and say you know what actually yeah I don't see Samsung's trifold phone even if they have already used the letter z for a phone that looks nothing like a z Hua is ahead but I think the reason they're doing this is because this is all they can do see the Huawei us band in 2019 completely crippled this company cutting off access to their suppliers from all around the world basically means that in some ways huawei's Tech has frozen in time like look at this the chip that powered huawei's P10 this is their 2017 flagship phone is based off a 16 nanm fabrication process the lower that number the better cuz it basically means the chip is more efficient so let's look at next year the P20 Pro wow huge Improvement 16 nanm all the way down to 10 NM and again with the next phone the P30 Pro 10 nanm all the way down to 7 this is the year the US band struck and if you look at Huawei phones since then in 5 years they haven't actually managed to move past 7 nanom now don't get me wrong huawei's chips have been refined since then they are better but it's just that the Baseline Tech is now far behind the rest of the world and I think this is huawei's way around that to not really talk about the chips or the rest of the tech like the storage speeds that are also stuck in the past but instead to try and come across like they're not behind but actually still ahead by creating a new design otherwise it might start to look like they're just releasing the same phones again and again and clearly is working I mean this thing has racked up over 7 million pre-orders in China alone that's like that's like Samsung flagship phone levels of performance and it has people running around inside Apple Stores doing this whatever this is but here's what this dated China focused Tech actually means so let's try opening up Call of Duty war zone [Music] okay yeah that's actually completely dead on the loading screen okay let's try a different game so this one boots up but it's pretty clear that this isn't designed for running top tier modern applications well on a screen like this and that's not even talking about the battery which is actually quite good for a phone at 5,600 Mah hours but bad for a tablet it's like half of the capacity that you would expect so even though you have to give credit to Huawei for releasing this not even as a slightly juny concept phone but a genuinely usable consumer grade product I still wouldn't actually recommend anyone ditch their normal bar phone it's still got that slightly stuck in the middle of two things and does neither particularly well syndrome which is probably why the initial frenzy of everyone buying the things up to resell them at twice the price is starting to cool down rather quickly now let's be honest though the main reason people are buying this phone is to flex on people literally so let's use this video sponsor the insta 360 X4 camera to catch that in so here's what I think is absolutely amazing about this camera it captures every single thing around you all at once in 8k resolution by the way so you don't need to angle it you don't need to check the feed to make sure you're not missing anything all you need to do is to hold it or put it in a backpack and this is what that footage looks like it automatically gets rid of the invisible selfie stick so all you can see is this like drone floating directly in front of you perfectly locked onto you but the software is the best bit cuz let's say that you're looking through the footage afterwards and you catch something that you want to follow like in this case this person looking at me like the fool that I am acting as you can literally just tap on their face and your camera tracks them automatically after you've already taken your video and if you don't want to do any editing at all there's even an AI button that automatically selects the best bits for you link below to get yourself the X4 with a exclusive 10% discount as well as a free 3 m selfie stick to get your own drone like shots like this"

Come on, come on! [beeping] Ryder! Skye's pup tag! Great, Chase. She's got to be close. And paw prints.
We're definitely getting closer. Keep looking. [beeping] I see Skye's hat. [animals squeaking] Oh, just bunnies. But that means Skye was there.
Where did she go? The drone found more paw prints.
Follow that trail. Everest. We found pup prints leading away from some bushes near Bear Rock. On my way, Ryder. But it's going to be dark soon. That's why we've got
to find Skye quickly. The snow covered Skye's tracks. We may never find her
in the dark. Hmm.
If the drone can't find Skye, maybe Skye can find the drone. Chase, power up all the sounds
you can on the drone. Great idea, Ryder. [siren wailing] Huh? [Skye] Over here, here I am! [Chase] There she is! Skye! [Ryder] Everest, we found her! Listen for the drone's siren. [siren wailing] [Skye] Everest! I see her. [howls] Hang on, Skye. The slope's too steep
to reach you on the snow cat. But I know another way
to get you out. [barks] Sled! Yay! Why the sad face?
You can come too. Hop on! [giggles] I'll have you up
at Jake's chalet and cozy warm in no time. [upbeat music] [barking] Yay! That's close enough, Harold. You can't stop me. [groans] Great job, Skye. Rocky, use your x-ray vision
to disable his rocket thrusters. On it. [barks] Energy pliers! Hey! You wrecked my rockets. Just for that,
prepare to be teleported. Chase, charge up
and use your sonic bark! Ruff! How did they get
all these cool new superpowers? I mean,
just okay new superpowers. I've got to get out of here. Marshall, time for
a charged up super jump. Hey, I can't see. Where's the button
for the windshield wipers? -Marshall's slowing him down.
-Great. The robot is powered by
a meteor piece in its backpack. Now is our chance to pull it out
and shut him down. Put your vehicles in hover mode. [howling] Your ride stops here,
Mighty Pup. Uh-oh! [laughs] Next stop, Haroldville. [shouting] Gotcha!
Now, let's go stop that bot. Mayor Harold's home,
and not a pup in sight. What? I'll teleport those pups
to the North Pole! Whoa! -Whoa.
-Close one! Rubble, time for this big bot
to go down. Time to wreck and roll. Whoa! Whoa! Got it! No fair! Haroldville was gonna
be the mightiest town ever! I believe this is mine,
nephew not a mayor anymore. Come on, kitties. Let's go on
that hat snatching spree. [gasps] I see it beside us. What kind of shark has wheels? The kind
that's not really a fish. I'm gonna check it out. [barks] Lights! Wait, it looks like
someone's inside of it. It's the... [sneezing] Kit... [sneezing] The Kitten Catastrophe Crew? [sniffs] Yup, them. Ryder, what would the kittens
be doing in a mechanical shark? It must be another one of
Mayor Humdinger's silly schemes. He's probably
around here somewhere. [Skye] Actually,
I found him on the beach! Ah! I've been spotted! He must have hid
when everyone else left. Uh-oh! The water keeps rising
inside of the sub. Let's get it back up
to the surface. [meowing] What are you kittens doing? Ryder, that shark sub
is out of control! [gasps] I'll stop it. Zuma,
I need some help on the beach. Skye, I think Mayor Humdinger
is about to have some company! Mayor Humdinger, the shark
is heading right for you! Uh-oh. Stop! Kittens, help! We're coming, Mayor. I'm ready, Ryder. Oh, how did my little plan
to scare everyone off the beach go so wrong? Skye, use your seaplane scoop to get Mayor Humdinger
out of the way. [barks] Scoop! -Huh? What?
-Gotcha! Zuma, stop that shark. Cool! I've never gone fishing
on the beach before. [meowing] This treadmill should
keep you running in place. Thanks. -[powering up]
-Huh? Oh, no! Not again! Ryder,
the treadmill didn't work! And now,
he's headed for the mountain! [Ryder] We're on it! There he is, Ryder! [shouting] Skye,
we lost the mayor in the woods. I'll find him. [barks] Goggles! He’s headed for a cave that belongs
to a really big bear. Chase, use your net to stop him! Ruff! Ruff! Net! Phew,
we ""bear-ly"" avoided a disaster. Good job. Skye, do you still see
Mayor Humdinger? Roger that.
I can see his shiny metal pants. Metal, that gives me an idea. Rubble, I need you
and your electo-magnet to stop a runaway mayor. Rubble on the double. We'll meet you
at the top of the mountain. Come on, Chase. Ryder! Mayor Humdinger
is headed straight for a cliff! No problem. Help me! This is gonna be close! Help! [shouting] Help, I’m falling! Help! [chuckles] Open your eyes,
Mayor! I got you! Huh?
Oh, get me out of these things! Uh-oh. [groans] Are you okay, Mayor Humdinger? Phew. Yes. Thanks for saving me
from those horrible Auto Pants. No problem. Whenever your pants
are out of control, just yelp for help! Uh, Ryder,
there is one more thing. Can I get a lift
back to the race? [chuckles] Pluck, pluck, pluck. It took my silo,
and the mayor and Chickaletta! But, how? No one is flying
the Pluck-O-Matic. Oh, no! Chickaletta must have
accidentally hit the auto-pluck button! We're gonna need more pups. Chase, Rubble, Marshall, Zuma, I need you
to save Mayor Goodway. Go, go, go! [barking] Help! Help! Hang on, Mayor! We'll get you safely back
on the ground! [barks] Net! Jump, Mayor Goodway! Okay, here goes! [gasping] I can't catch up with it. I can help you!
Get ready, let's go! Whoa! Now, how do I shut
this Pluck-O-Matic down? Tell Rocky
to hit the red button. That'll turn off
the auto-pluck mode. Rocky, hit the red button. Aha, red means stop! Auto-pluck mode, off. I did it! [alarm beeping] Uh-oh! Oh, no, it dropped the silo! [barking] Nice catch, Robo-Dog! [cheering] Great job, pups. Thank you, PAW Patrol, for saving me
and my precious Chickaletta! -And for saving my silo!
-And my Pluck-O-Matic! You're welcome. Whenever you're in trouble,
just... -[clucks]
-For help. [whirring] Ah, ooh! Oh no! Careful! Watch out! [gasps] I can't look! Phew! Rubble,
Mayor Goodway's special plate is stuck on top of a flag pole. We need you to use your crane
to get it down. Rubble on the double. Clean up. Clean up. Uh-oh. Looking good, Rubble.
Nice and gentle now. Please be careful. Clean up. Clean up. [gasps] Oh, no! Clean up. Clean up. Clean up. Follow that bot. Whoa. So this is what it's been doing
with all the plates. We'll need to get them down. But first we've got to figure
out how to stop that bot. If I could just catch up to it, I could open the control panel
and turn it off. [gasps] I've got an idea. The waiter bot wants
to clean things, so if you get dirty,
the bot will come to you. That's a great idea, Ryder. There's a mud puddle
right over there. It looks... awfully wet. What do you say, Rocky? Anything for a rescue. -[splash]
-I sure hope this works. Clean up. Clean up. It worked! [barks] Screwdriver. Clean up.
[powering down] Clean up... Great job, Rocky. Now let's get those dishes
back to their owners. Coming right up or down. Thank you, pups. You got my plate back.
And not a moment too soon. Just in time for lunch. [laughing] [gasps] I got to save Chickaletta. Phew! Close one, little chick. I'd better get you back
to Mayor Goodway. Whoever's there,
get me out of here! Is Mayor Humdinger in the safe? Yeah.
We have to distract Meow-Meow so we can get him out
and then stop that robot cat. Rory, Shade,
we need some backup. -You got it.
-On our way, Ryder. Skye, we need something
to distract Meow-Meow away from the safe. Roger that, Ryder.
I have the perfect thing. Wanna play? A steel yarn ball?
I love steel yarn balls. Who's there? Anybody there? Meow. Lion roar! Shade, I need you
to get Rory close to Meow-Meow so she can jump on him
and shut him down. But you have
to be super stealthy, so he doesn't fly off. On it, Ryder. Time to get sneaky. Follow me. Meow, meow! Thanks, Shade. This is the perfect spot to...
Tiger Pounce! Whoa! Oh, no! [grunts] Whoa! Lion strike! Okay, fine. You can have your silly key
that means so much to you. Mayor Humdinger,
please tell Meow-Meow to bring Rory back down. [scoffs]
His command collar fell off and this remote control
is useless. Whoa! Skye, we need to find
Meow-Meow's collar. Copy that, Ryder. There! I see the collar, Ryder. But... it's not gonna be easy
to reach. Ryder, I can get the collar.
Let's pounce. Meow-Meow's getting away! I can help. Roar! -[yelps]
-I got this! Collar back online, Ryder. Meow-Meow,
go to Humdinger's lair. I obey purr-fectly. Chase, catch up to Skye and see if your spy drone
can locate Marshall. Spy Chase is on the case. [sniffing] Huh? Found you!
Ugh! At least I thought I did. [barks] Spy drone control! [barks] Launch! Huh? What's all that buzzing? Pesky mosquitoes. Nice work, spy drone. Ryder, I found him. Good work, Chase. There you are, little bunny. Is this your home? [gasps] You're a mama! [thunder rumbling] [squeaking] No, come back! Whoa! Are you guys okay? Oh no, you're trapped! Hang on. [straining]
I can't do this by myself. Ryder, it's Marshall. I need you
and the Paw Patrol right away. -Right here, Marshall.
-Whoa! Chase, what are you doing here? We've all been looking for you,
Marshall. [barks] Zip line away. Ryder, Rubble, you guys got here just in time. Lightning hit a tree and it
fell on top of a bunny burrow. One bunny ran off into the woods and the rest are trapped
in the burrow. Chase, find the lost bunny. Rubble, get your rig. Marshall,
this tree is still smoldering. You know what to do. I'm fired up. [barks] Water cannon. Great work, Marshall. Rubble,
I need you to lift this tree. Rubble on the double. Come on, bunnies.
You're safe now. Any sign of Francois? Nope. We have done
a whole lot of looking and not much finding. Yeah, he could be anywhere. And there's so much area
to cover. That moon reminds me of...
the disco ball. It got stuck
on Francois' balloon. That thing is shiny. If we can find the shine,
we can find Francois. Great thinking, Liberty. Skye, use your goggles to see if you can spot any moonlight
reflecting off the disco ball. Roger that. [barks] Goggles. [Skye] Come on, disco ball. [gasps] Ryder, I found the disco ball. Hmm. But I don't see Francois. I'm on my way. Hmm. That looks really steep. Skye, use your harness
to pick up Liberty. Will do. All right. Air Liberty
has lift off. Thanks, Skye. Francois, you around? Whoa! That wind is strong. [Francois] Help! Help me! Skye, did you hear that? Yeah, Francois must be...
under the balloon? Lower me a little.
I can move it. Is that Liberty? [gasps] You are so good
at the Pup Pup Boogie. May I take a selfie avec vous? Thanks,
but we'll save the selfies for after
we get you out of here. Hold tight, Liberty,
I'll lower you. Liberty, jump into my arms,
I'll carry you out. Works for me. Skye, wait!
We cannot leave Liberty behind. I'm trying, but this wind
is really kicking up! Liberty! Don't worry, Francois. When in doubt, boogie it out. [gasps] Incroyable! Liberty, you are the master
of the cool moves. Tres bien. Now, let's go home. I'm so glad you're here, Ryder!
Bats have taken over her shop. I don't think they meant to.
They're just confused. We'll get them back home.
How's it going, Rocky? I made bat wings
out of a broken umbrella. Great. Okay, Chase, ready? [barks] Drone. [Chase]
Hey, the bat's following it! [Katie]
Good job! Two down, one to go. We got 'em all! Ready, Ryder? Send them over, Chase. You did it, PAW Patrol! Now, take them away, far away! I'll get these little squeakers
back to their cave. And hurry back
for the dance party. Miss a chance to boogie? No way! The speakers are ready. Thanks.
Let's check how they sound. Can I help? Sure.
Tell me when I'm loud enough. -Check, check.
-A little louder. Testing, one, two. A little louder. I'm turning it up all the way. -[booming] Hello, Adventure Bay!
-[rumbling] That's loud enough! [giggles] I'm good. Hey, DJ Rubble.
Ready for your big show? Almost. I just want to practice
before everyone gets here. Let's get this paw-ty started!
Wave your paws in the air! [record scratching] I had to let the mask go to save
that tall dog with the stickers. You made the right call, Shade.
We'll stop him. We just need a little speed
to catch up to them. Whoa! You got here fast. Cheetah Speed. We need your speed
to find the Ruff-Ruff Pack. You got it, Ryder. I know the desert
like the back of my paw. Tail rocket! [meows] Whoa! Look at all that dust. Thanks for the easy trail
to follow, Ruff-Ruff Pack. Hurting these dogs
will be my pleasure. Hey! Hi, kitty. Not this cat again. Step on it! Get along, little doggies. Go on, Gasket.
He can't chase both of us. They split up, Ryder. I'm following Gasket,
but I'm not sure if she has the mask or not. Thanks, Wild. Shade, Chase, we need
to follow Dwayne and Hubcap. They're moving quickly. But if we distract them,
we can catch up. I've got some pup treats. Chase, think your launcher
can reach them? You bet. [barks] Launcher. Ooh! A yummy pup treat! This is no time for a snack,
Dwayne! I've got the mask
and you can't catch me! Uh-oh. No! [gasps] Sneaky. I mean, ha-ha! That was a trick. Gotta run, Gasket. I'm off to get the real mask. Hubcap, look out for that cliff. Cliff? What cliff... [screams] Meow! Tail Sweep. Good work, everyone.
You rescued Hubcap and the mask. [growls] Drats! I can't move. Stop! Stop stepping on it! Whoa! [groans] Mayor Humdinger? Ryder, help! We can't slow down. We're on it, Mayor. This has
just gotten way more serious. Use your spy suction boots
to climb on board. [barks] Wall climbers! Hold it steady, Ryder. Amazing move, Chase. [scoffs] About time, Ryder. Skye,
get Robo-Dog into position. On it. All aboard! All right, kittens.
License and regi-- [sneezing] This is as close as my... [sneezes]
as my nose lets me get. Come on, kitties,
make room for Robo-Dog! [meows] Yoo-hoo, kittens! Watch the yarn. [meows] Now go get it! [gasps] [barks] You got it, pups! Yes, well, hmm, it appears as though the pups
have saved the day. -[barks]
-Oh, no! Ryder, the gas pedal is stuck. I'm on it, Chase. Engage auto-pilot. And... ugh! Made it! Ahem! You're just going to leave me
tied up in a chair like this? -Sounds like a good plan to me.
-[grumbles] I see what the problem is. A good yank should fix it.
Chase! Right, Ryder. [barks] Zip line! You did it, Chase. Thanks, Ryder. Robo-Dog, hit the brakes! -Phew!
-[Humdinger] Ow! Oh, get off of me! Big Truck Pups,
ready for action, Ryder, sir! Ryder, dude,
this truck stop is totally... [howling] I love the high in the sky view. Yeah, we can see the highway
and traffic and even... [gasps] the lookout.
Way, way over there. And that storm moving in. Glad you like
my big surprise, pups, and we've got
a big mission to go with it. The train ran off the tracks
while heading up the mountain... Yikes! to deliver materials
to fix the leaky dam. Looks like a mega-sized mess. Yep. We have to make sure
those girders and cement blocks get up to fix-it crew at the dam
so it can be repaired, and we've got to do it
before the big storm hits. [gasps] So for this mission,
I'll need... Me! Please? I really want to use
my building skills to help but I'm not sure how much stuff
my construction rig can carry. You don't have to worry
about that, Rubble, because each pup is getting
a brand new big truck. Big trucks! Just like Al! So, Rubble, I need you to use
your new big truck's crane to pick up
those spilled supplies and load them into the bin
in your truck trailer. Rubble
on the double duty double! And Rocky,
I need you to use your truck to repair that locomotive. Green means go! Hey, good buddies. I'm on my way to the crash site
and ready to help. That'd be great, Al. And when we haul
the supplies up to the dam, you can show the other pups
some trucking tips. Sure, I'd be glad to show them
how to be a gear jammer. That's trucker talk
for speedy driver. [chuckles] That's a big 10-4
and out the door. Honk, honk! [horn honking] [howling and cheering] Alright, the Big Truck Pups
are on a roll! ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ -♪ Rubble ♪
-[horn honking] -♪ Rocky ♪
-[horn honking] [barks] ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ [horns honking] Big truck deploy! [barks] Drone! Be careful, Ryder. We've got a lot of stopped cars and some downed street lamps
in front of you. Thanks, Chase. Al, Rubble,
watch out for obstacles ahead. Whoa. What a mess! Skye, Rocky,
I need you to clear the road and fix the street lamps. -This puppy's gotta drive!
-Put the hammer down! Chase,
any sign of the yacht yet? Yup, there it is, heading right toward
a bunch of cars! Oh, no! Then let's make sure
it doesn't hit them or anything else on the highway. Or on the side of the highway. Thanks, Chase. Al, Robo,
you need to go full speed. Full speed?
That's my favorite speed. But first,
we have to get the mayor and the kitties off the yacht. Chase, use your drone
to rescue the kitties. Sending the drone over now. And Skye, airlift
Mayor Humdinger to safety. Good timing, Ryder. I'm fixing the last lamp now. On my way. [grumbling] This is so annoying! Now I'll never get
a selfie with a whale. [meows] And by selfie, I mean myself
and all you kitty selves. Mayor Humdinger, I'm going to use my drone
to save your kitties. Sorry, kitties, I like you,
but I like me much more. Me first! [scoffs] Selfish animals! [sobs] What about me? Don't worry, Mayor Humdinger. Skye's gonna airlift you. Finally! What took you so long? [gasps] My hat! Oh, no! Rubble, warn that man
to get away! Oh, no! The silly horn isn't going to warn that driver. Boat coming! Get out of the way! [sighs] That was close. I really need a proper horn,
not a silly one. Ryder, there's the van! See if you can stop it
with your winch. [barks] Winch. I missed! But you found the paintings. [barks] Megaphone. Person driving the van,
you need to stop, please. Actually, I need to go, go, go!
[laughs] Uh-oh, the paintings! [barks] Winch. We need more help
to pick them all up. Rubble, Rocky. -Rubble on the double.
-Green means go! I always wanted
to be an art collector. [barks] Extender. [chuckles] Who knew
paintings grew on trees. Sorry I couldn't ""bear""
to see you step on it. [laughs] I should have been a bald clown. [groaning] Ryder, the van is out of control
and heading toward a cliff! [barks] Winch. Stay in your seat,
we'll help you out. Stay in my seat? But I'll fall! Skye,
I need you to save the clown. [Skye] One clown, coming up. [sighs, gasps] -[chuckles]
-[gasps] Mayor Humdinger? Uh, what could I say?
I'm an art lover. -[honks]
-Hoo, hoo, hoo! [snickering] -[vehicle approaching]
-[squirms] The drone should be
just around this corner. And it says here
that we're near... [both] Foggy Bottom! It looks like someone stopped
the water on purpose. But wait. If the water
isn't going to the duck pond, where is it going? [meows] Excellent job blocking
that tunnel, my kitties. The duck pond doesn't need water as much as my slide does.
[snickers] Faster, my felines! More water! Your mayor is ready
for the coolest cool-off ever. Hmm,
if we take off a few planks, the water will start
to flow again. And then the duck pond
will fill back up. Good idea, Ryder! Easy, Zuma. We don't want all the water
to gush out at once. Got it. Okay. Now let's get out of here before this tunnel fills up. -Yeah!
-Woo-hoo! [ducks quacking] Don't worry, little critters. Ryder will fill your pond
back up. [loud rumbling] -[quacking]
-[croaks] Wet, wet, wet! [laughs] Woo-hoo! It's ready,
the greatest water slide ever! And it's all mine!
Run faster, kitties! I want it wet, wet, wet! [yowling] What? What's happening? What did you kittens do?
Where's my water? [meows] [clucking] Okay, Marshall, let's get those chickens
off the tracks. This is chicken for
""back to the barn, please."" [clucking] [clucks] And that's chicken for
""we're happy right here."" But we've got
to get the train going. Do you know any other way
to make them move? Hmm. How about dancing? Everybody loves
to do the cluck-cluck. [clucking] Nice moves, Marshall. Great job, pups. All the animals are back
where they belong. Except for Garbie the Goat. And Travis.
I wonder where they are. [phone rings] Hi, Travis. We were wondering
where you went. Funny story, mate. Garbie and I were driving home,
and well, now we're on top of a mountain. -So... help!
-[Garbie bleats] Try not to move too much,
Garbie, or... [yelps] that will happen! [screams] [Ryder] PAW Patrol
is on its way, Travis. Rocky, balloon repair update. I just patched last spot.
It's ready to fly. Awesome. Can you fly it over
to Travis and Garbie? [Rocky] I'm on my way. -[Garbie bleats]
-Easy, easy! Skye, use your hook to snag the pickup truck's
front bumper. Nice. Rocky, where are you? I caught an updraft,
so I'm almost right above you. [Ryder] Great.
Lower the balloon's anchor and hook the pickup truck's
rear bumper. Anchors away! [Ryder] Perfect! Travis, you and Garbie
get back in the truck's cab. You're gonna fly
back to the farm. [barks] Drone,
go find an itty-bitty Marshall. [gasps]
Oh, you need help with that? [barks] Water cannon! [chuckles]
You're welcome, ant pals. Hey, my ball! Thanks. Wow, I'm still so far away. Chase's drone! Yes! What kind of critter is that? It's a Marshall critter! -Yes!
-Yeah! I could totally
ride the drone home if I could get up there. How can I... huh? Thanks! Whoa! [grunts] Yes! Where did he go? He must've moved
out of the drone's range. Let's try looking for him
with the Lookout's periscope. Okay. Drone, return. [howling, barking] Whoa! Woo-hoo! Whoa! Hey, wait for me! Chase, Rubble... it's me. Down here! I thought I heard something,
but I guess it was the wind. They don't know I'm here. Worst elevator entrance ever. Did you find Marshall? Only his truck. Let's check the periscope. My truck! That gives me an idea. [barks] Ladder! Hey, everybody! Miss me? -Marshall!
-Where are you, Marshall? He's on the pup-pad.
Good thinking. You see me? Yay! Go, Marshall! Go, Marshall! Uh-oh. Whoa! Phew! It's back online. It's looking for that satellite
to send messages to. Ryder,
the satellite's heading your way but the drone can't keep it up
much longer. Al, time for your big truck's big claw to make a big catch. Ten-four, hammer down. That means I'm going fast. Gotcha! Whoa! Phew! That was close. -Woo-hoo!
-Nice catch! Great job so far, pups. But now we have
to figure out some way to get this satellite
back up into orbit. Gonna need a mighty big rocket. [gasps] Or a whole lot of water,
like our toy water rockets. -Remember?
-Great idea, Rocky. But where can we find water
out here in the desert? I know! Breaker, breaker,
Marshall and Rubble. Put the pedal to the metal
and hightail it to the desert. [barks] Pup-pack shovel. I sure ""dig"" the way you dig. Time for some big truck
water power. Space cargo ready to launch. Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, blastoff! [cheering] Oh look, Chickaletta. The phone is working again. Let's get you to class. [gasps] There they are, and I can see which path
to take. Follow me. Grandpa, that's Chase's drone. The PAW Patrol is here. We're saved, we're saved! [trumpets] I see them.
PAW Patrol, over here! No, Alex, don't climb over
those fallen walls. They're too dangerous. He's right. Tracker,
can you give Alex a lift? Sí, Ryder. [barks] Cables! Woo-hoo! That was cool! Thanks, Tracker. De nada, Alex! You're next, Mr. Porter. Chase, use your zip line. You got it! [barks] Zip line! [trumpets] Ryder! Pups! The baby elephant
is still trapped! An elephant is too heavy for me
or Tracker to lift, even if it is just a baby. Then we need a strong solution. Rubble,
bring your rig to the maze. Chase's drone
will show you the way. Rubble on the double. Did someone call for a pickup? I need you to lift those slabs to free
that trapped baby elephant. You got it. Ha! You're free, baby elephant. Paw-some work, Rubble. And so fast. Tan rapido! Pretty a-maze-ing, wasn't it? [gasps] Skye to Ryder, the pipe is rolling
towards the beaver's home. Should I try
to move their lodge? We can't move the beaver's home.
It might fall apart. See if you can find anything
to stop the pipe. This should do the trick. Pole-y paw-some save, Skye. And now it's time
to go pipe fishing. [barks] Big truck deploy. Whoa! That's a whale of a pipe. Ryder, we got it! Great! Just one more to go. How beautiful. A very tiny butterfly. And a very large pipe! Pas de problem,
I am a very fast runner. [gasping] And I'm also very good at not falling off the objects
at all. [yelps] The edge of a cliff! Okay, now,
this is a very big problem! Uh-oh, the pipe picked up
a passenger. Al, we got to catch them
before they roll off the cliff. But we can't get too close
to the edge or these trucks
will take a tumble. Let's stop here. Big truck deploy. Whoa! It is getting much harder not to fall off the object
at all! I've got you! [barks] Net! Merci, Chase. Ryder, we've got the pipe. I'll tie it down
and head to the highway. Good work, good puppies. Now that we have
all four pipes secured, all of you meet me
at the repair site. Robo-Dog, let's roll. [barks] Chase, keep an eye
on the runaway dinosaur while we rescue Mrs. Wingnut. Yes, sir, Ryder. Mrs. Wingnut,
if you can get on the roof, we'll get you out of here. Okey dokey. Skye, I need you
to airlift Mrs. Wingnut off the roof of her trailer. Will do, Ryder. [Skye] Rescue target in sight. Nice flying, Skye.
Now lower your harness. Woopsie! Whoa, Nelly! Okay, Rubble. Now lift the trailer
off the rock with your crane. Ready for liftoff. Ryder,
I've caught up to the Robo Dino. Good. Now use your ejector seat
to get aboard and find its off switch. Roger that.
[barks] Ejector seat. Whoa! Huh? [chittering] Ryder, I found out what's making
the Robo Dino go haywire. There's gophers inside it,
and they're eating the wires. Joyriding gophers?
We'll be right there. Thanks, pups. Just in time
for my favorite TV show. [laughter on TV] One rescue down, one to go. Uh-oh, Ryder! We're on our way, Chase.
Rocky, follow me. Better hurry, Ryder. Looks like we're headed
for a fall in a way deep canyon! -[gulps]
-[Ryder] Hang on, Chase. We're gonna lower
those gophers out. Rocky, get your peanut launcher. Peanut launcher loaded. Fire away, Rocky. Bye now, see ya! Ryder, it worked... so far. Gotta find the off switch. Hurry, Chase. [powering down] [sighs] Cut it! close, Chase,
but great job. Whoo! Look at my new drone, everybody! What's going on? Hey, who's driving my van? What's wrong, Mayor Goodway? My car just drove off by itself! And my van decided
to make deliveries without me. It's almost as if the cars
are being controlled, Ryder. -Hmm.
-No fair, kitty carrier. I'm supposed to be the driver! We gotta round up
these runaway cars. Chase, Marshall, head for town, find Mayor Goodway's car
and Mr. Porter's van -and stop them.
-You got it. There goes my snowcat, after it! [Danny] Oh, yeah! I'm probably
the best drone pilot ever. There it is. And look,
there's Daring Danny's drone. Why is my snowcat
driving around like that? It's driving in circles,
just like the drone up there is. Look! That's it. Daring Danny's remote
must be controlling the Snowcat and those other vehicles, too. Danny, dude,
turn off your controller. He's too far away to hear us. Hang on. We're gonna have
to catch up to them. [gasps] Kitties, come back! Don't worry, Mayor Humdinger.
We'll stop them. Skye, Danny's headed
toward Farmer Al's. I need you to tell Danny
to turn off his controller. Roger that, Ryder. [Skye] I see Danny way up ahead. Great! Let's catch
that runaway Snowcat. Rubble, head off the snowcat and use your leaf bags
as bumpers. Got it, Ryder. Thanks for the lift, Rubble. No problem. Not so fast, snowcat. Great job, Rubble. Uh-oh. This ship's headed
for the rocks! Ryder, Sid's ship and the horses are gonna crash into the cliff. I know who to call. Zuma, we need your help. Let's dive in! [neighing nervously] Hold your horses, horses.
I got you. [barks] Buoy! Nice work, Zuma. Okay, now we need you
to bring that ship to shore. I'm on it, Ryder, dude. Paw-some move, Zuma! Skye, any sign of Sweetie,
Sid or Arrby? Not yet. Wait. What's that? Ryder, I found them.
They're in a little boat. Great, Skye.
Bring them to shore. On it. [barks] Harness. I'm here to rescue you. But I can only take
one at a time. [barks] Claw.
Queens first, obviously. Nu-uh!
I'm the captain, I go first! -No, me!
-No, me! [Skye] Please,
I'll get you all to safety. But you can only go
one at a time. Fly me away, Skye. No! Me, me, me first! Whoa! [coughing] Could I please get back
in the boat, cap, boss, Mr. Sid, sir? [gasps] Skye, lower me down. I need to help Arrby. Grab on, quick! [barks] Claw. Wait right there, Sid. I'll be right back for you. My first mate is ditching me
for that silly queen. Fine! I don't need, need,
need him anyway! Oh, Sweetie! I was so worried. Thank you, Paw Patrol.
You're my heroes. You're welcome, Princess. Whenever your pup
is lost at sea, just yelp for help. Careful of that oil. Jet ski! Slick move! Hmm.
That streamer looks too high. [chuckles]
It's definitely lower now. Just about got you! Whoa! Oh, no! Oh, yes! Wow! Just like I said.
I'm a whiz with decorations. [chuckles] Ha! We finally lost
that silly PAW Patrol. [groans] Drat,
who put this canyon in our way? That's my piñata!
Don't break the treasure inside! Naughty kitties. Oh, no! Whoa! [sneezes] Leaves?! Birds?! Nature, yuck! Skye, Mayor Humdinger's
rolling down the canyon. See if you can catch him
with your harness. This pup's gotta fly! Hold on, Mayor.
Help is on its way. [barks] Harness. Phew! Thanks. But you're still not getting
this piñata. The treasure is mine...
as soon as I can get it out. No! My piñata! My treasure! [sobbing] [barks] Zip line. -Quick thinking, Chase.
-Thanks, Ryder. Now let's get to that party. Stop right there, Moby. This castle is for
all the mer-pups in Puplantis to enjoy. Not with this remote it's not. We need to get that remote,
aqua pups. Moby, you're in bubble trouble. [barks] Bubble launcher. [gasps] Time to get you annoying
aqua pups off my island. This super slick move
will send them overboard. Whoa! Bow wowie! Nice snag, McSquidly! Let's get out of here,
McSquidly. [gasps] They're getting away! We have to stop Moby
before someone gets hurt. Robo Dog,
bring the whale patroller. [barks] Skye,
I need your eyes in the sky. This aqua puppy's gonna fly. Aqua pups, stand by. Skye, what can you see? Moby and McSquidly
are on the floating castle. They look like
they're in trouble and the castle is headed
right for... [gasps] Adventure Beach! Oh, no! With all those people
on the pier? Pups, we need two teams. Zuma, Rubble,
Marshall and Chase. You're going to sail
alongside the castle and try to steer it
away from the beach. You got it, dude. Coral and Skye, I need you pups to get back
aboard the floating castle and stop that propeller. Okay, aqua pups, let's go! PAW Patrol, I looked everywhere for Eddie and Emmy,
but I still can't find them. We're on it, Cassie.
Chase, start your air search. Right. [barks] Drone. Down here! Get me out! [groans] Zuma,
that lever controls the ride. Can you switch it off? One bump coming up. Chase, keep searching
for Emmy and Eddie. [chuckles] Good one, Mayor. [laughing] Stop enjoying this. [laughing] [barks] Buoy. [groans] Oh, Ryder,
thank goodness you're here. Have you found Eddie and Emmy
and the Humsquatch? It's back. We're still looking
for the Mayor Goodway. [gasps] Looks like the
bumper cars are finally empty. Let's go. Don't worry, Cassie. I'll keep looking
for your dear children. Humsquatch or no... -[roar]
-[gasps] Humsquatch! Run! Ryder, Rocky, the Humsquatch
just passed the hot dog stand. And it's headed
for the bumper cars. We have to lure it
out of the carnival. Let's use these hot dogs
as bait. Yummy idea, Ryder. Hey, Humsquatch! Want a snack? Weenies away! Hot dogs, yum! No,
I wanna go on the bumper cars. [sniffing] There's something strange
about that Humsquatch. Hmm. Chase,
any sign of Eddie and Emmy? No, and my drones searched
the whole carnival. Maybe they're hiding. EMT Marshall, I need your X-ray
screen at the bumper car ride. On my way
for a ruff, ruff rescue. Whoa! Timmy, chuck to me! [barks] Let's hope this plant
likes dino treats. Whoa! Oh, no! [barks] Harness. Thanks, Skye.
That would have been messy. Great work, pups. Now,
make sure you keep a close eye on that baby dinosaur. Huh? [heavy footsteps] Look, Timmy, it's your daddy. [roars] [gasps] It's okay, guys. He just said,
I'm coming to save you. But I think he means from us. [roars] Quick, Rex,
tell him we're trying to help. Roar, roar, roar, roar. I don't think he can hear me
over all the noise. [roars] [whimpers] Oh, it's okay, Timmy.
Your daddy's gonna be okay. Ryder,
the plants have trapped him in. And now this big giant plant
is coming for him. Skye, use your hook to pull
the big plant away from him. Roger that, Ryder. [barks] Hook. [straining] I can hardly...
get it... to budge. We need to do something. I've got an idea. Remember when Marshall
dropped the ball off his nose because
the butterfly tickled him? Sure, Ryder, but who even knows
if plants are ticklish? Only one way to find out. [barks] Dino claw! Coochie coochie coo! [giggling] It's working. Go, Rex! He dino did it! Aqua pups, ready for action,
Ryder, sir. Thanks for hurrying, pups. Moby's taken the whale patroller and is crashing into everything. It's up to us to stop him. But Ryder, dude,
all of our rides are on the whale patroller. You're right, Zuma.
It's gonna be a challenge, but we can do it. So for this mission,
I'll need Skye. I need you
to use your manta drone to search
for the whale patroller. This aqua puppy's gotta swim. And Coral,
you know the ocean best. We need you
to help us find clues to where
the whale patroller went. By land or sea,
you can count on me. Alright,
aqua pups are on a roll! Hmm. It's gonna be hard to catch up
to the whale patroller. If only we could swim that fast. [gasps] Are you thinking
what I'm thinking? [barking] Wow, Coral,
what did you say to them? I just I asked them
if they wanted to help and they do. I bet I could find
even more helping fins. That would be great,Coral! [barking] Say hello to your rides. Wow, awesome! Now I can say I saw a sawfish. [giggles] You're gonna be my ride,
Robo Dog? Thanks. Alright! Now the aqua pups
are really on a roll. Moby went this way. Skye,
see what your drone can find. Roger, Ryder.
[barks] Manta drone. Hmm, looks like something
really tore through the seaweed. Oh no! That may have been
the whale patroller. Let's go, pups. Thanks, Chase. Does anybody have eyes
on Mayor Humdinger? [Skye] I've got him, Ryder. He's headed
for Twistabout Canyon. If we lose him in that maze,
we may never find him. I'll stay right on his tail. Whoa! Roger.
I have to get him out of here and turn him back towards you. Yelp, yelp, help!
Yelp, yelp, help! Oh, no! He's launched
search and rescue drones. Be careful, Skye. I'm never gonna be able
to turn him around if he keeps launching things
in my path. You'll need
to get in front of him. There's a side passage
that could work as a shortcut. It's kind of narrow, though. Skye, are you okay? It's pretty tight, but I should be able
to get in front of him. [gasps] Yikes! [sighs] Mayor Humdinger, follow me. I'll help you bring the copter
out of this canyon and safely set it down. Whoa! Mayor Humdinger, wait! Ryder, Mayor Humdinger's
out of the canyon and headed back
towards Yumi's Farm. Excellent work, Skye, but we still need
to bring him down. I'm on it. We'll be ready here. Rubble, Rocky Zuma, get the emergency landing zone
ready. -On it!
-Totally! We've got this! [screams] There's the landing zone. Okay.
Setting the autopilot to land. [barks] Wings! Mayor Humdinger, take your hands
off the controls. If I let go of the controls,
I won't be in control! [gasps] [screams] [barks] Prototype up. [barks] Slow and turn. [barks] Hover and descend. [barks] Engines off. -Alright!
-Way to go, Skye! [chuckles]
Paw-some driving, Marshall. You made it just in time.
Thanks, pups. Chickaletta! Mommy's here! A-ha! I finally got it to stop! See, kitties? I told you
I could get the hang of this. [sighs] Now, walk to Foggy Bottom. [squawks] [gasps] Chickaletta
is one extreme chicken. That remote does not belong
to you, Mayor Humdinger. Oh, I was just, uh... trying it out.
Yes, uh... Push, Push! Give it back, Mayor Humdinger. Fine!
It doesn't even work anyway. Uh, guys,
I didn't make it do that. Or that!
This remote isn't working. There's no way
to control the robot. Ryder, that crate is smoldering and might set something else
on fire. We have to put it out. Let's do it.
Skye, while we put it out, you go keep an eye
on that monster. I'm on my way. [barks] Wings. Zuma, sprayer! [barks] Sprayer. Rubble,
put sand on it to keep it cool. [barks] Shovel. Chase, use your heat scanner to see
if anything else is smoldering. [barks] Heat-scanning visor. Marshall,
there's something by the crate. It looks red hot. Not anymore. Hey,
that's Gigantosaur's antenna. It must have fallen off. So that's why
the remote wouldn't work. We have to stop that monster.
Come on! There's only
one good thing to burn. Let's burn rubber. [barking] -Hi, Ryder. Hi, PAW Patrol.
-Hey, Alex. Which way did the penguins go? They went this way and this way and this way.
And then Grandpa went, whoa! -[chuckles]
-Yes. Careful, Ryder. There's ice
and empty fish boxes all over. Hmm. We can use some of that
ice to cool the penguins down. Let's put these ice blocks
in the back of your truck. On it, Ryder. Chase, use your drone
to help us find them. Chase is on the case. [barks] Deploy drone. Drone, penguins, go! I've got the drone tracking
on my pup pad. Let's follow it. -[sirens wailing]
-Hi! [blows whistle]
No running around the pool. No belly sliding either. Ryder, please tell
that chicken in the wetsuit to obey the pool rules. That's no chicken.
That's a penguin. This one's having
a pretty good time. Chase, your net. On it. [barks] Net. -Got him.
-Nice snag. Works every time. Okay, penguin,
let's see how you're doing. [barks] Thermometer! Open wide. Hmm, a little on the high side. Here you go, little penguin. These will help. Nice work
cooling off that penguin. [beeps] It's the drone.
I wonder what it found. [moos] That's the first cowboy
I've ever seen in a tuxedo. [laughs] Time for a penguin roundup. [munching] [barks] Welder. I'll secure it. Ryder, I've reconfigured
the transform-o-zapper. It'll act as a shrink ray now. We can get
that big cat back down to size. Awesome work, Shade. Let's get Meow-Meow
into position. [barks] Megaphone. Meow-Meow, please move
to the center of the bridge. [scoffs]
I'm almost at full strength. Why don't you make me?
Meow, meow. Nice and wet down here,
robo dude. It's pretty damp this way, too. Hench Cat,
don't let her zap you! You're no good to me small.
Just eat the zapper. Don't mind if I do! If Meow-Meow eats the zapper, we'll never be able
to turn them back. Meow, tail sweep! Whoa! Shade! Nice catch, Skye. I just had that fixed, for free! Hey, Meow-Meow,
how about your favorite snack? Huh? Ooh! Ah! I'm getting dizzy. Purr-fect aim. Meow, meow. [cheering] [sobs] No fair! Meow, meow. We can't drive any further,
pups. We'll have to hike from here. Chase, send your drone ahead
to search for Mayor Humdinger. [barks] Deploy drone. [barks] Launch. Find Mayor Humdinger. Which way should we go, Ryder? Let's check the map. First clue. Elephant plus tree. But there aren't any elephants
in the mountains. Maybe he meant something
like an elephant. [gasps] Elephant tree. [howling] According to the map, we go around the elephant tree. Come on. Wow! An elephant
with two trunks! [chuckles] Your drone found the mayor,
Chase, crossing a log over a river. There he is. Come on! [barking] What? Not this time, PAW Patrol. [straining] Good luck trying to cross now!
[laughs] Chase, use your zip line. Got it. [barks] Zip line. -[cheers]
-Okay, Chase! Great job, Chase. Ryder, which way now? The map says,
turn left at the snowman. A snowman? He must have hidden his loot
in the winter. Or maybe he meant turn at...
Snowman Rock! [barking, howling] Good, Rubble! Hmm. It needs something. [gasps] I know! Now it looks like a snowman. [laughs] Now, our next contestant, Cali. Unleash the yarn balls. [snickers] Oh yes, good job! [cheers] Time for some kitten star power. -Wow!
-Awesome! Wow, nice trick! Uh-oh. I'd better
get Meow-Meow out of there. Meow, meow. [yelping] Oh! I said out, not up! Come in, Skye. I read you, Ryder. We've got an airborne kitty.
Here's what I need you to do. [groaning] Found you! Hang on, Cali. Oh, I can't control Meow-Meow. Leave the robot, Skye. Cali needs you, and fast. I'll get her. [groaning] Yes! Nice job, Skye.
That was some fancy flying. Thank you, Ryder, Skye and pups. [Skye] You're welcome. Whenever you have a problem... Just meow for help. [laughs] Meow-Meow's performance
may be unusual, but he's obviously
the most outstanding cat here. Oh please, he's so disqualified. There's no room in our cat show
for fakey robot cats. I don't know what you... mean. [powering down] Just because
he happens to fly... Incoming! I find myself
in need of a towel. ♪ Skye ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol is on a roll ♪ Go, Skye! I'm on its tail! Wow, this is
one wild drone chase. I got the remote control. But the drone snatched
two of the piglets. See if you can make that drone bring the flying piggies
safely back to earth. Here goes. Uh-oh. I think those piglets played
a little too rough with this. [gasps]
The broken remote control must have turned off the drones. Oh yes, that's a very fine hat
for our chicken statue. No!
The pickup are gonna crash land right near
Mr. Porter's restaurant. Wait.
That pool full of pies would be the perfect landing pad. Chase, go over to Mr. Porter's.
I'll meet you there. On it, Ryder. Hit it. [barks] Jets. Chase, go to Alex's pool. Sure thing. It'll be okay, little piggies.
The PAW Patrol is here to help! Okay.
Now push the pool towards me. [barks] Turbo jets. [squealing] Okay, Chase, stop right here. [barks] Jets off! Bingo! -[laughing, barking]
-[ringing] -Chase? Chase, come in.
-Ryder? -Ryder?
-Chase? Chase? We must be too deep in the cave
for your pup tag to work. Don't worry. I'll run up
to the mouth of the cave and call Ryder. Don't move. Dude, I wish I could move. Oh, right. I'll be right back. [barking] -Here I come! Here I come!
-[barking] Got to catch me first. [giggling] Look out! [laughs] Sorry, Ryder. I tagged you a little too hard. [laughs] Guess I'm it. -[pad rings]
-[Chase barks] Ryder, come in. Okay, I can hear you now, Chase. How's the cave exploring going? Not good.
We need the PAW Patrol. What's wrong? We're pretty deep in the cave
and Jake got his foot stuck. He says it hurts
and I can't get him out. Don't worry, Chase.
No job is too big. No pup is too small.
We'll be right there. PAW Patrol, to the lookout! Ryder needs us! But what about Apollo Superdog? Come on, Apollo! Will Apollo save the day? His own way? I can't watch,
but I can't not watch. -Come on, pups!
-We're coming. Wow! Once again, Apollo saves the day
his own super way. Apollo's not even afraid
of a super gigantic spider. I know, Apollo's so awesome.
[chuckles] Come on, Rubble. Let's go. Whoa! -[chuckles] Made it!
-[all laugh] Chase, send out your drone
and let's find those penguins. [barks] Drone. There's one. Aw,
that penguin looks really tired. Marshall,
the penguin is past those trees. He could use some water. Wet, wet rescue, on the way! Drone, find the next penguin. [squawks] That poor penguin
looks even hotter. Let's go help him while the
drone looks for number three. Drone, find the third penguin. Chase, zip line up there. [barks] Zip line. Woo-hoo! Come on, penguin buddy. I'm here to help. Ryder, I think he's confused
and really hot. How did he get up there? Marshall! You're just the pup to help him get back down here. Spray some water up there. [barks] Water cannon! Come on, birdie buddy. Want a lift down to the ground? Good. Another penguin's out. Aw. But where's the penguin
Marshall brought? Dónde está? Come on out, penguin, penguin! -He's super shy.
-We need to lure him out. Rocky, go to Cap'n Turbot
and get some fish and bring your catapult. Green means go fish. Look, Cap'n Turbot
gave us a bunch of fish. Great. Use your catapult
to launch the fish to lead the penguins over
to Cap'n Turbot's boat. Mira pinguinos, it's lunchtime. Back in front. Yes! Out of the way! Huh? Alex,
you're going the wrong way. Wait. I'm going the wrong way. Uh-oh. What happened? Looks like Marshall's
back on track. [barks] Megaphone. Attention, road hazard. -Whoa!
-[giggles] Wow. Look at all the bubbles. Bye! Our racers are headed
for the finish line. Oh my, what an exciting race...
[yelps] [gasping] -Help!
-Oh, no! Skye,
the mayor's balloon is loose. Hurry! On my way. Pups,
meet us at the soccer field. Ryder needs us! [howls]
Race you to the soccer field. Hey, where'd everybody go? There's the finish line. [cheering, clapping] All set. Hang on, Mayor. This pup's gotta fly. Thanks, Skye. Hi, Mayor Goodway. Oh, Ryder. Thank you. -[clucks]
-Okay, pups. We're coming in for
a landing at the soccer field. Grab a rope and pull. Please get us down safely. Please, please, please. Mayor Goodway,
we're safe on the ground. Oh, right.
Chickaletta, we're safe! [snoring] [laughs] Now, get back at the race, pups.
It's not over yet! You better hurry, pups. Alex is headed
for the finish line. [gasps] [screeching] [gasps] Whoa! Ryder, the eagles
won't let the drone near Danny. Then we'll need to get
the eagles away from him. Skye? I'm on it, Ryder. If anyone knows how to get
an eagle's attention, it's me. Come on, eagles, follow me!
But not too close. Yes!
The eagles are following Skye. Chase, send in the drone. Okay. Time for
a walkie talkie drone drop. Cool!
It's raining walkie talkies. Can we talk later? I'm in the middle
of a flying lesson. Danny, stay still
until we rescue you. Okay, I'm still now. Oh, no!
I'm running out of canyon. I'll have to pull up. Ryder, I kept the eagles away
for as long as I could. But they're heading back
to the hoodoo. Thanks, Skye. Danny,
the eagles are coming back. Hang on and we'll get you. No, thanks. I'm good. My best eagle dudes
just want to help me fly. Whoa! Whoa! Scratch the flying plans! Help! Help is on the way. Whoa! Come on, wings, fly! Hey, it's working! I'm flying! [screeches] Thanks for the flying lesson. You eagles
are really good teachers. Bye, see you later! Oh, so that's how I'm flying
so much more extremely. I don't know if the drone
can hold Danny up much longer. [screaming] From now on,
leave the flying to me. Phew! Thanks for the
high-flying save, PAW Patrol. You're welcome. Whenever you're
in extreme flying trouble, just yelp for help. [sighs] Goodbye, geese.
Guess it's time to go. We'll sure miss you around here. Where's Fuzzy? Fuzzy, where are you? Fuzzy?
Where did he go? Ryder! Fuzzy is gone. We have to find him
before his flock leaves. Fuzzy is missing?
No job is too big. No pup is too small. PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! Ryder's calling! [yawning] Morning, Rubble. Excuse me. Can someone please
turn on the lights? Oh! [chuckles] [upbeat music] [yawns] [snores] Whoa! Ready for action, Ryder, sir. Pups, we have an emergency
in our own backyard. Our geese friends
have to migrate with the rest of their flock. But they're missing
one little goose. Poor Fuzzy. It's all my fault. If we don't find him fast, they'll have
to leave him behind. Chase, I need your megaphone
to try to call Fuzzy. Chase is on the case. And Marshall,
Fuzzy would follow you anywhere. I need you to help
look for him, too. I'm fired up. Alright!
PAW Patrol is on a roll! [barking, howling] ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Chase ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Marshall ♪ Ryder, I could send my drone
down each scent trail to see if one of the animals
has the guitar. Hmm. That's a lot of animals
to follow. You might not find it
in time for the concert. Chase, instead of following
the animal scents, could you try following
the smell of the guitar? Paw-some idea, Ryder. I could get the guitar scent
from the guitar case. [sniffs] I've got the scent. [meows] Oh, wow.
Would you look at the time? I'd better head back
to Foggy Bottom for my concert. Good luck finding it. [snickers] Now it's my turn
to make wonderful music with this guitar. Hmm. How do you play this thing? -[animals yelping]
-See? It's easy to sound great! [sniffs]
The scent leads this way. Everybody, listen. [discordant guitar strums] That's my guitar!
Being played terribly. I'll track it down
with my drone. [barks] Drone. [gasps]
Mayor Humdinger has the guitar. I know a shortcut to that spot.
Follow me. -I'm coming too.
-Hop on, Gustavo. [yelping] Hey, what are you doing? Don't you want to hear
my marvelous music? Come back here with that guitar! There he is! Mayor Humdinger! Oh, I... I was just trying
to rescue that guitar for you. I told you animals took it.
Kittens! -Look out!
-Ah! Go this way! Got it! My guitar! I'm on it! [barks] Net! Meow. That hill is too steep
to drive up. We'll have to run. I'll call for backup. Skye, we may need
some airborne help here. Roger, Ryder.
This puppy's gotta fly. [meows] [giggles]
You can't be hungry, Cali. You already ate all your snacks.
Come sit with me. Uh-uh. Grandma made these treats
especially for the PAW Patrol. [stomach grumbles] You sure have a big appetite
for such a little kitten. [loud rumble] Wow, you really are hungry. [loud rumble] [gasps] Oh, no! Excuse me. What happened? Rock slide on the tracks. We're stuck on the bridge until they can find someone
who can clear it. I know who can help. [pad rings] Hello. Ryder here. Ryder, there's been a rockslide
at the old Trestle Bridge. Hold on. Let me look
through the periscope. Whoa. Don't worry, Katie.
The PAW Patrol is on the way. No job is too big.
No pup is too small. I got it, I got it. [laughing] [beeping]
PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! Ryder's calling! That should not count as a goal. Me first! I'm gonna be first!
I'm gonna be first! [barking, cheering] I am first! -Look out!
-Whoa! Told you I'd be first. [sighs] I never get to be first. Hmm? Yay!
The PAW Patrol's here, Grandpa! Hey, Alex. Hi, Mr. Porter. We'll have that tooth found
in no time. Chase, send the drone
to search the playground. Yes, sir, Ryder, sir. [barks] Drone. Rocky, check those hiding spots
in the jungle gym in case
the carrot fell in there. [barks] Claw. Nope, nothing there. [gasps] I found something. My Apollo super-pup
action figure! I've looked everywhere for it.
Thanks! Zoom! Chase,
see if you can find anything with your infrared goggles. [barks] Goggles. Ryder, there's something
carrot-shaped in the bushes. I got this one, Chase. Ugh! Whoever lost this lollipop
is not gonna want it back. [beeping] Hey, the drone found a carrot. The signal is coming from
over there by the soccer field. Follow me. [barks] [beeping] Stop beeping at us,
you flying pest. Drone, stand down. False alarm. [chuckles] Sorry, ma'am.
It was only doing its job. [beeping] Alex, Mr. Porter,
the drone found it. Alex's tooth is on the seesaw. Chase is on the case. Woo! [gasps] No! Uh-oh. Don't worry, Alex.
The PAW Patrol's on it. -[squawk]
-Huh? That crow's heading
toward the bridge. Hey, come back! What's up, Ryder? You are, Skye.
I need you to fly to the bridge. A crow took the carrot
with Alex's tooth in it. This puppy's gotta fly. [yips] Ryder, can I come? It's my tooth. What do you think, Mr. Porter? Please, Grandpa. Well, it's all right with me
if it's okay with Ryder. Hmm. Come on, Alex. We've got a tooth to find. Yeah, we can do it. -Easy, Smiley.
-[croaks] [groans] Ryder, I'm in! That's great, Skye. And just in time. [squawking] Oh no, I can't see! Go higher! Pull up! Stay back! Whoa! -[cheers]
-She made it! [chuckles] I knew she would. [laughs] Oh yeah, that's the spot. [panting] She cleared the lighthouse! -Yeah, Skye!
-[cheering, howling] Whoa! Our next contestant
is Alex's frog, Jumpy Jumper. [crowd cheers] Go, Jumpy Jumper! Ryder, is Skye gonna make it? Smiley's jumping next. Hang on, Marshall. Let me check. Skye, Smiley jumps next. Roger that. Okay, Smiley.
No more messing around. Heel. [barks] [sighs] That's better. We're headed to the field. Okay, we'll meet you there. Chase, let's roll. Let's go watch Smiley jump. [barking] -[croaks]
-Easy, Smiley. We're almost there. No. I said, easy.
Heel, sit, stay. Ryder, he's out on the wing. I'm afraid
he's gonna jump too soon. Fly as low as you can, Skye. Chase,
stay under the helicopter. He jumped! Nice work, Skye.
Chase is on the case. [barks] Megaphone. Stay clear. Emergency. Very important frog
coming through. Chickaletta! Oh, no! The remote control is jammed. I'll get Chickaletta. Hey! I'm calling Ryder. Hmm. I have ten hangers, four cans of paint
and a bunch of rats. Wow, that's a lot of stuff,
Rocky. Well, you never know
when someone might have a closet emergency. [laughing] [pad rings] -Hi, Mayor Goodway.
-Ryder. Chickaletta's flying off
on a drone. And the remote's broken. Oh! Uh-oh. And these butterflies
are acting really strange. We're on it.
No, chicken is too high. No pup is too small. Robo Dog,
bring in the air patroller. PAW Patrol,
to the air patroller. Ryder needs us! [barking, howling] Whoa! Sorry, guys.
I got a little... hung up. [laughing] PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir. This is a strange one, pups. Chickaletta is stuck
on a runaway drone. And unusual butterflies
are flying around Adventure Bay causing chaos. So for this mission,
I'll need... Rubble, I need you
to use your hoverboard to rescue Chickaletta. Rubble on the double. And Skye, I need you
to use your supersonic wings to find out where these strange
butterflies are coming from. This puppy's gotta fly. Alright! PAW Patrol's on a roll! ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Rubble ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ Hold on, Olivia. Help is coming. Ryder, not a minute too soon. It'll be okay, Oscar.
We'll help Olivia. But Mr. Wingnut,
the eggs need to stay warm. Can you help Rocky make
an incubator back at the nest? I'm on my way. Okay, Lightning Bolt,
mind going forward this time? Hee-yaw! Okay, Rubble, liftoff that rock. You got it. [barks] Crane. Nope, uh-uh. Huh, maybe. -Whoa, Lightning Bolt!
-Hey, Mr. Wingnut. I've never made
an incubator before. Will this work? Looks pretty good, Rocky. Let's go fetch a light bulb and we'll be in
the egg warming business. Come on! I sure hope Mr. Wingnut found
Oscar and Olivia. I'll be right back, Robo Dog. [barks] [barks] It's okay, Olivia.
We'll have you out in a jiffy. That's it, Rubble,
almost got it. Pull it up, gently. Great job, Rubble.
Okay, Skye, use your harness. Ostriches don't fly
but they do today. Here we go, Olivia. I don't think Olivia
likes flying. I have to set her down. Then we'll have
to find another way to get her back to her eggs. So then we just aim the light
at the eggs to keep them warm? It's as simple as chili pie. They'll stay nice and cozy
until... [gasps]
The chicks already hatched. [barking] Um, are baby ostriches supposed
to sound like that? [barking] Uh oh!
Looks like the babies think Robo Dog is their dad. Whoa! He sure can dig. Where'd he go? Huh? Whoa!
Where did you come from? [chuckles] Sorry, Zuma. I see you've met Robo Dog. Yeah, he totally woke me up. Let's try Flying Robo Dog. -Wow!
-Nice! -Wow, it sure can fly.
-Huh? What else can it do? It should run super fast. Aw, no robot can outrun me. That totally sounds
like a challenge. Challenge, huh? I'll do it.
I'll race the robot. I'll start it.
Megaphone. [barks] Runners to the starting line. On your bark, get set... Go! [cheering] Whoa! [groaning] Way to go, Marshall! I'm stuck. Time to try turbo power. Huh? You won't beat me! Ryder, the Robo Dog! Look, its antenna is all bent
and broken. [barking] -[gasps]
-Whoa! Where did it go? I don't know. That broken antenna means
I can't control it. Robo Pup? Chase, stop them with your net. Roostario! Stop rolling around
this shabby playground. Mommy's here, Chickaletta! I've got a delicious
corn cob for you. Shabby playground? [barks] Net. Hey! Oops! Sorry. Chickaletta,
Roostario, slow down! Henny Jenny? You're supposed to be
in the Best Peck event. Oh, peach fuzz!
I must've left her at the farm. Please watch my hens, Danny. That's Daring Danny X! There's Danny's gliderboard. But where are the chickens? [Skye] Ryder, they're on
Farmer Yumi's truck. Is something wrong, Ryder? We're chasing down
some chickens. And there they are! Case closed. And there they go!
Case unclosed. Skye, the chickens
are on the move again. I'm on their tails, Ryder. I'll try to grab it.
[barks] Hook. Ryder, this drone is flying
too wildly to catch, and now it's headed
right over the water. Zuma, I need you
for a speedy ocean rescue and there's something special
I want you to bring along. Ready, set, get wet. Hang on, dudes!
Help is on the way. [barks] Rescue corncob! Way to go, Zuma. I'll get the broken drone back
to Mr. Porter. [chuckles]
Well, it's not a real corncob, but it is a real lifesaver. I can still wreck your hall
with my wrecking ball! Ugh! Okay, okay! I just need
to get a little closer! Time to think big! [roars] Nice work, buddy. So what? I still have a crane. I could use a little help. Tuck, Liberty! Come on, Tuck!
Let's cause a little trouble! Little is what I do. Rescue is my middle name. Lights out, Codi. Come on! Move, move! Okay! I'll move it for you! [groans] Amazing! Oh my goodness!
It's almost fully charged and we'll be sent to the moon! Let's see some cat pack power! Meow, tail sweep! Whoa! -Strength of a lion!
-[roars] Sorry to burst your bubble,
Codi. But your demolishing days
are done. [barks] Bubble. We stopped the Codimolisher,
pups. But we have to help Codi now. -[grunts]
-Relocator is fully charged. You can successfully send
the townspeople to the moon. Great.
If I can't have Adventure Bay, no one can! Stop spinning! Uh-oh! The relocator has successfully
relocated us to the moon. Ugh! Elly-Dee, bring in my plans
for building a space ship. Adventure Bay hasn't seen
the last of Codi Gizmody! [pad ringing] Hello, Ryder here. Oh. Hi, Ryder. Hi, Cap'n Turbot. What's up? Well, I'm a bit embarrassed
to report my boat is... I guess you'd say, uh, stuck. The Flounder ran aground? [chuckles] Afraid so, Ryder. I'm caught on some rocks
and the tide's going out. If I can't get free, The Flounder will end up
in the bottom of the bay. Is it possibly within
your PAW Patrol power to help? Don't worry, Cap'n Turbot.
No job is too big. No pup is too small. [beeping] PAW Patrol to the Lookout! Ryder's calling. Aw, I guess
I'll have my bath later. When there's trouble,
Rubble's there on the double. -To the Lookout!
-Ryder's calling. Gotta go. [howling, barking] Whoa! Sorry. Took that last turn
a little too fast. Ready for action, Ryder, sir. Okay, PAW Patrol,
we have an emergency. Cap'n Turbot's boat
has run aground. Help, help, help! He's stuck. If I can't get free, The Flounder will end up
in the bottom of the bay. We have to help. -Cap'n Turbot needs us.
-We have to save The Flounder. -[gasps]
-What's a bay? We need a plan
to get his boat off the rocks before the tide goes out. Zuma. [barks] I'll need you
and your hovercraft to help me pull the boat
off the rocks. Let's dive in. Skye, I'll need you
to fly your copter overhead and find the best way
through the rocks. [barks] Let's take to the sky. PAW Patrol is on a roll! [howling] [barks] Net. [bleats] Thanks for finding Lamby, Chase. Good work, pups. Now let's track down the honey
and the hive. The honey jars
were in this crate, and the beehive was right here. The bees inside the hive
are probably asleep now, but it'll be morning soon. Whoa. So whoever has the hive has a bunch of sleeping bees,
too? Let's see if they left
any clues behind. [barks] Goggles. Ryder, I see some paw prints. [sneezes] Kittens! Mayor Humdinger must be
behind the heist. That's a good guess, Chase. Let's try to track him down
with your drone. [barks] Drone. We found him. He's headed to Foggy Bottom
and he's pulling a trailer. I bet the honey and the hive
are in that trailer. Let's go. [stomach grumbles] Oh! All this sneaking around
has made me hungry. Time for a honey break. [straining] Got to twist harder. -[snoring]
-Hmm? Why are these lids on so tight? [yelps] [grunts] Finally,
this is going to taste so good. A bear! [screams] Better get out of here, kitties! [buzzing] [gasps]
A jar of Yumi's yummy honey! Mayor Humdinger came this way. -Let's go after him.
-[cub squirms] Ryder, look, a baby bear
is stuck in the tree. We'd better help
the bear down first. Don't be scared, little bear. If you climbed up the tree,
you can climb back down. [roars] Yikes.
That sounds like the mama bear. Hmm. We need to get
her baby back to her. But we don't want
to get too close. I know. What if we use the honey
to lead it back to its mama? I can hang the jar
from Chase's drone. Good thinking, Rocky.

Our gadgets and gizmos used to be quite reliant on the good ol’ AA battery or, if designers wanted to be annoying, the AAA battery. Look, there’s not a huge difference in size between 
the AA and the AAA and they usually cost the same per battery so whenever some engineer out there decides that a thing 
which could clearly fit longer-lasting AA batteries in it will go with just as expensive but shorter-lived AAAs instead, I get a wee bit angry. I mean, just look at this remote control. It could totally fit AAs in there,
just look at how much extra room th - wait is that a Duracell PowerCheck? Indeed it is! If you were buying batteries in the late ‘90s, you probably remember these. The idea was that rather than need to use some sort of 
battery tester to see if a battery still had any charge left in it, you could build that tester into the battery. And that’s what Duracell did - as well as some of their competitors. As a matter of fact this version of the idea came from Kodak, and there’s a whole fascinating story
around patent disputes which I won’t be getting into (long story short, James R. Burroughs had a similar
but technically different idea slightly earlier than Kodak but both patents got approved which caused some kerfuffles -
I’ve linked to a great article down below which explains all that). Here, I just want to focus on how the Duracell version worked,
because it’s quite clever! But also much much simpler than you might have imagined. If you want to test a battery like this, you’re going to want to measure its voltage. Like most battery chemistries, ordinary alkaline manganese dioxide
cells experience a drop in voltage as they discharge. When fresh each cell has a voltage around 1.5, maybe 1.6 volts (and the standard AA, AAA, C, and D batteries are composed of just a single cell, like an amoeba!). But that voltage steadily diminishes as the battery is used up. When you’re halfway through it’ll be down to around 1.2 volts
and when it’s near empty it’ll struggle to produce even a single volt. So, a quick check of a battery can be done with a multimeter like this one. If I use it and probe across this battery here, it's reading 1.57 volts so this is either brand new or hardly used. This one, though, it's only reading 1.06 so it’s pretty dead. This test isn’t perfect because we’re not checking the batteries under a load,
but it’s still fairly reliable. Trouble is, you need a multimeter to do this as well as the 
knowledge of how much voltage drop is acceptable before it's dead. So lots of inexpensive battery testers were made 
which are really just analog voltmeters with a scale that reads good and bad. But what if you could build a voltmeter into the battery itself? Well, that’s ultimately what Duracell did with these batteries, 
but the way they work is a little… odd. First, you’ll notice that the battery says to test it
at 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 21 degrees Celsius. That probably means the tester’s functionality
has something to do with temperature, and indeed it does. But before I get ahead of myself, let me just show you how these were used. It says “press dots to test” and, well, that’s all you had to do. Except… if you remember these you’ll know that you had to press quite hard. Dig your nails in there a little bit. Once you did it though, the little bar
below the power gauge would suddenly turn yellow, filling up from right to left. If the whole bar turned yellow, the battery was full. And less and less of it would turn yellow as the battery wore down. Now, with a use by date of March 2003 it probably won’t surprise you
to learn that these batteries are in fact very dead. I got the tester to turn yellow with a little
movie magic involving a foot switch and a hair dryer. Because heat is what turns that little bar yellow. Behind that little window is a small amount of thermochromic material,
which as the name implies changes color based on temperature. It’s the same sort of stuff that goes in a mood ring
or one of those thermometers you might stick on an aquarium. The specific chemical in here is simpler - it merely indicates it’s above a certain temperature threshold, but it’s the same general idea. What makes it heat up, though? Well you may have noticed that the testing window is perfectly in-line
with the two dots you’re supposed to press to test the battery. The tester is built into the battery’s label, which I’ve removed from this one. In case you’ve never seen an unwrapped alkaline battery before,
well this is what they look like. The positive terminal is actually part of the battery’s shell,
and it extends almost all the way down to the negative terminal. A small insulator separates the negative tab from the shell. And if we compare with one of the still-wrapped batteries, we’ll see that one of the testing dots rests on the negative terminal
and the other rests on the battery’s shell (which, remember is the positive terminal of the battery). Looking now at the backside of the label,
we’ll see that those testing dots are above electrically conductive pads. The pads on the negative side are very difficult to see,
they’re these three grey patches which don’t look all that impressive, but the positive contact patch is quite obviously a metal foil of some sort. And the contact patch sits behind a round hole
in a thin piece of beige insulating material. That insulating layer keeps the pad from touching the battery shell
unless you actively press on the label and force it through. If you exert enough force on both dots for their respective contact patches
to touch both ends of the battery, you complete a circuit. To what, you ask? A tiny little heater. That heater is in contact with the thermochromic material,
so if the battery has sufficient charge, when you press in those dots and complete the circuit,
the heater will warm up the indicator and turn it yellow. But it’s not quite that simple. While you could just use a very thin wire heating element,
that would only allow for a simple pass/fail test. If the battery had enough oomph 
left to produce enough heat to make the indicator yellow, great! But you wouldn’t necessarily know how much oomph it had left. So instead, the heater has a varying cross-sectional area
to produce a gradient of heat output across its length. If I remove that paper insulator, we can actually see the heater. Kind of, anyway. I’m not sure exactly what it’s made of -
it might actually just be the same foil that makes up the contact patch. Regardless, it is visible and you’ll notice that it has a slight taper,
becoming narrower towards the negative end of the battery. That means its resistance actually varies across its length, which also means the voltage drop across each part of this heater when it’s operating is different.   If the battery is strong enough, its voltage will be sufficient to heat the entire thing,
so all of the indicator turns yellow. But if the battery is getting weak and voltage begins to fall, then only the skinny, high-resistance part of the heater will get warm. Most of the voltage drop occurs in that part of the heater, and the battery doesn’t have any more volts for the rest of it,
so only that part gets warm enough to turn the indicator yellow. And luckily I can show you this with a DC power supply. When I provide this with just 1 volt,
you’ll see that only the right side of the graphic turns yellow. To clarify, the indicator always turns yellow at the same temperature,
and the entire bar is filled with the same indicator. But low voltages (caused by a weak battery) can only get the skinny part of the heater warm enough to actually change the indicator’s color. But when I crank the voltage up,
now all of it gets warm and so the whole bar turns yellow. And of course the bar is aligned with the zero to 100% scale
to give a reasonably accurate impression of the battery’s useful life remaining. It’s a very elegant solution using tech so simple
that it can be printed on a label. Oh, and remember that beige insulator? Turns out it’s not just electrically insulating, it’s also thermally insulating. That slot cut into it is there to maintain an air gap
between the heater and thermochromic material and the battery shell. The battery shell is made of thermally-conductive material and it’s rather massive,
so if the tester were in physical contact with the battery shell, it would suck all the heat right out of it and it would never turn the indicator yellow. Keeping it away from the battery is necessary for the indicator to function, so the same piece of what’s essentially just paper is functioning as
both a crude power switch for the tester and thermal isolation for the indicator. Neat. You might have realized that since the 
battery is powering a heater to test itself, that means each time you test it you’re using up a little bit of its capacity. And this is true - though it also means the test is slightly 
more accurate since you’re doing it under a load. It’s not like the actual scale here is all that 
accurate but testing under load is critical. These 25 year old batteries test at about 1.3 volts on the multimeter,
which would suggest they’ve got about half their capacity remaining. But their ability to produce any current flow is completely shot. If I manage to activate the tester while also probing the battery, you’ll see that the voltage plummets
to not even half a volt as the heater is placed in-circuit. So, sure enough, these batteries are dead
and their inbuilt tester does actually reflect that. Yet the multimeter doesn’t. So then… why did it go away? Duracell PowerCheck was a pretty short blip on the landscape 
of disposable batteries yet it’s clearly a useful, functional feature. Well, the patent disputes and licensing shenanigans are 
one clear reason but I honestly think there’s a simpler one: not that many people were actually testing their batteries on a regular basis! Yes, we all know about the loose batteries in the junk drawer
that may or may not save the TV remote in a trying time, but aside from random situations like that, I think it’s fair to say most people used and continue to 
use batteries in a pretty straightforward way: they simply stay new in the package until they 
get put into a thing which needs batteries,   and then they stay in that thing until they 
die, at which point they’re gotten rid of   and another set of fresh batteries replaces them. I’d argue it’s pretty uncommon to take partially-used batteries out of a thing
and then put them in the junk drawer for later use. I’m not saying I think that never happens - I myself have a few tools which need batteries but I don’t keep batteries in them since I rarely use those tools. But I do think in the grand scheme,
keeping half-used batteries around is infrequent. Certainly infrequent enough to question whether it actually makes sense to spend the money putting a battery tester on every single battery. These are commodity items, and while there surely is some 
brand loyalty out there for the most part they’re competing on cost, and so if you need a pack of batteries and you use them like I do,
a built-in battery tester is just a weird gimmick which makes them more expensive (and makes me less likely to buy it). And as I already said, 
if you remember these, they weren’t easy to use! It was actually quite frustrating to jam those 
dots in there and hope it turned yellow. And if I were the type of person who kept partially-used batteries in random places,
I would probably just buy a battery tester and keep it around. Or, ya know, just try putting them in whatever needs batteries 
and see if they work. That was always an option. I think that in hindsight, this is a pretty clear case of a really clever,
and very neat idea which was unfortunately born from a very particular frustration. A frustration that the inventors thought 
was more common than it actually was. Duracell used to include inexpensive battery testers in the packages of their batteries, and they worked very similarly to the PowerCheck feature here. Some people found them hard to use,
or were bothered by the fact that they were easy to lose, and that could be seen as a legitimate problem to solve. Which Duracell did by incorporating those testers into the battery! But I don’t think anyone asked how 
often those testers were actually getting used in the first place. Because if they had, I’m not sure this would have ever happened. Of course these days, most of our devices which need batteries 
are using rechargeable batteries, so we’re just not buying or using disposable batteries as much as we used to. Which I think is unequivocally a good thing! It’s kinda nuts how normal it used to be to 
burn through these and then just throw ‘em away. I had a Game Boy and that one device 
must have gone through dozens of these. And then there was the Walkman, my camera,
the light for the game boy, and who knows how many other toys I had
which needed constant battery replenishment. Thank goodness we’re past that. Mostly. Uh, but even for the devices on sale today which need AA batteries? They often tell you how much charge is left so
putting a tester on the battery itself really just isn’t necessary anymore. Alright, well I think we’re done. I want to extend a thank you to Luis Solano for suggesting this video topic. It’s been on the docket for a while but, uh,
well these haven’t been in production for quite some time so it took me a while to get my hands on them. And I have a second thank you for Ernie Smith - this is at least the second time my research began
and immediately I was presented with a thorough Tedium article. I would have gone more deeply here were it not for the 
fact that this video was originally slated for November but production issues on a different topic moved it up to now, so if you’re interested in those patent details and some of the backstory, be sure to check out the link in the description. Normally I try to put something clever here but I think I’m all out of juice. ♫ exhaustedly smooth jazz ♫ like most battery chemistries, ordinary alkaline magaz— magazine? Are you subscribed to Alkaline Magazine? Lots of inexpensive battery testers were made which are really just analog voltmeters with a scale that ride— DANG IT Kind of. I'm not exactly... oh I don't like that delivery ...but there ability to produce any curr...mmmmnaAAGH ...plummets to not even half a volt as the plater... mehah huhhh It was actually kind of frustrating to
push these dots in and wait for it to light up. And if I were the type of person who kept part- yep, I can't say ""light up"" I'll get pedanted for that. If I were the type of person who kept randomly used partially used aaaaahggghhh! So apparently these were made for much longer in some markets and also hung around for a while here in the US on some of the high-end batteries Duracell sold. TBH I had no idea but mostly because
I'm a value-obsessed Midwesterner who mostly buys generics (or might splurge for Rayovac if it's on-sale). Does this count as an end-captions gag? You decide!"
8reaJG7z-is,I Visited Apple&#39;s Secret iPhone Testing Labs!,Where 10000 iPhones are built and destroyed before the first one ships The original thread: ...,Marques Brownlee,2024-06-07T21:31:09Z,28,[],PT10M52S,3742744,8904,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"♪ Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ - So a couple days ago I
dropped a Twitter thread, yes, I still call it Twitter, and I severely underestimated how many of you guys
would be interested in it. But then a lot of the conversation that it drove was really interesting, and a lot of discussions that
happened afterward were fun to participate in, so I figured I would drop
even more of the footage here. So I'm back with more of my footage and clips from my visit to Apple's secret iPhone
durability testing labs. So if you ever wondered how an iPhone gets
water resistance tested, or drop tested, or shaken like crazy before it gets announced on stage, these are the labs where
all of that happens. And then they have to connect the dots between their test results and how they actually build
phones, which is fascinating. So the first thing that I saw was the water resistance testing. So I think a lot of us kind of take for granted at this point
most high-end smartphones, most flagships have IP68 ratings. But a lot of people don't
actually think about it, that that is a code, where IP stands for ingress protection, and then the first number is for solids, and then the second number is for liquids. And so each of these numbers
gets higher and higher as it's more protected against ingress. So some, like, earbuds or
headphones, for example, you might see they are IPX4 rated. That just means they're
not protected from dust, but from water, they can
withstand some light splashes from any direction. So sweat. Great. So the first iPhones all the way up to the iPhone 6s were not
water resistant at all, at least not rated to be, but then the first water-resistant iPhone, iPhone 7, was IP67 water resistant. And then now we see everything being IP68, meaning it can literally be underwater for an extended period of time. And so this is what it looks like to actually test that stuff. There's literally specialty equipment just to torture phones with water
and make sure they can survive. So lots of companies have these things, but it was cool to see it in person. So the lowest level of this
test is basically a drip ceiling to simulate rain and splashing. So there's no real water pressure here. But a pass is good for IPX4 on this test. But then to simulate some water pressure, they have these jets that
rotate around the device and spray it with water from all angles. Into the speakers, into the earpiece, into the ports, everything. And if it's able to pass this test, that's good for IPX5. It seems so simple, but it's
also pretty cool to see. I've never actually watched this happen. To turn it up to 11, they
just put the phone on one end and stick basically a literal
fire hose on the other end and just blast the phone
with high-pressure water. Kind of looks insane, but if we want our modern smartphones to be able to get splashed
from any angle many times over its lifetime and survive, then it has to survive this. And then it earns its IPX6 rating. But then, finally, for IPX7 and IPX8, that's full submersion. So they have some lockable sealed tanks. But some of you may already know that IPX8 is supposed to be under
deep water for long time. So they actually have
this pressurized tank where they can turn up the pressure inside to simulate different water depths and leave phones in there
as long as they want. So now, ideally, today, if you drop your phone in the
toilet, or spill water on it, or drop it in a lake, whatever, for as long as it's down
there, it should survive. Which, again, we kind
of take it for granted, but that's all the seals and the gaskets and all the adhesives and
things that go into getting it to pass those tests are what get it to pass the real-world tests. Now, there is an entire
separate type of testing that you might have
already seen on YouTube. That is, drop testing. And it turns out Apple has been doing their own internal drop
testing for years now. So it turns out, in the same building, Apple's set up this full on
industrial robot by Epson that they've programmed
to be a drop test robot. And then they've set it up in front of these ultrabright lights and super-high-speed
Phantom cameras pointed at the exact spot on the ground
where the phone will land. So the idea here is they
can program the robot to pick up the phone and
drop it onto any surface. (robot whirring) And then they can have it
repeat that exact motion and that exact same drop
on the exact same angle over and over again, but
with different surfaces, and they can A/B test them and take a look at exactly what happened. And then those of you
who are camera nerds, you already know these Phantom
cameras are pretty serious. I don't remember the exact frame rate they told me they were shooting at, but it's pretty incredible. You can actually see the titanium on this iPhone 15 Pro wobble on its first impact with the ground. And its second impact too. So yeah, they had all kinds
of different materials to do drop tests, from
granite countertops to marble, to corkboard and wood, et cetera. They even had this massive block of asphalt just sitting there, just waiting to see how the
iPhone reacts to being dropped in the streets, you know? But this is a fascinating setup. Now, of course, the fact is, most phones still just break immediately when you drop them on the ground. So I kind of wonder how much of this data is actually getting translated into real changes of phone design. But it's still cool that I
got to see all this stuff. And then the hardest one to capture, for me, anyway, is the shaking tests. Yeah, that's exactly what it
sounds like. Shaking tests. Apple has rooms full of machines that are literally trays of
devices strapped to a surface that's being shaken thousands of times at a specific frequency. It's actually kind of hard to record, because if my shutter speed
is at the right number, it doesn't even really look
like anything's moving. Kind of like how car wheels
don't look like they're spinning if you have the right camera settings. But I did get a few clips
where like I put my hand on it, and you can see it's moving a lot. They're using this machine to
try to simulate years of wear and tear out in the real world. Apparently, they can
program in the frequency of a certain motorcycle
engine, or a car engine, or subway car, or whatever
constant vibration that they just want to check up on, to make sure everything
holds up to exposure to it over a very long time. But I really think the
most fascinating thing about all this testing is they are trying, before the phone even comes out, they're trying to simulate
years of wear and tear in the real world, with real customers, in a small room under the
basement of Apple Park, with, like, the machines
that they've designed. It's a fascinating connection
they've gotta make. And I spoke to John Ternus, who's the head of hardware
engineering at Apple, about this process, and
he mentioned, apparently, they go through sometimes 10,000 iPhones, prototypes, before they
actually ship a final phone, with all this durability testing. Which sounds crazy. I don't know what number I
thought it was in my head, but it seems insane that they'll
make 10,000 phones to break before they ship one. And actually, while I had John there, I felt like this was a
unique opportunity to ask, 'cause I've never really heard people from Apple actually speak
out about the durability, but also the repairability of the iPhone. Like, we all know Apple's
reputation for repairability: not great. Like, the iPhone's notoriously
very difficult to repair. But also, now it's a little clearer because the more I've thought about it, the more it feels like, I mean, Apple's just shown me a
ton of durability labs, and durability feels like it's directly at odds with repairability. Like, it actually feels like
it's basically a sliding scale, with durability on one side
and repairability on the other. And the more durable you
want to make your thing, the less repairable
you're making your thing. And all these decisions
that go into making and designing a product
are kind of pushing it back and forth along this scale. So take a listen to this. - But sometimes, for me, I find it helpful to kind
of think about the bookends. Like, if you imagine a product
that never fails, right, that just doesn't fail. And on the other end, a product that maybe isn't very reliable, but is super easy to repair. - Right. - A product that never fails is obviously better for the customer. It's better for the environment. - Okay, it's interesting
you put it that way, 'cause on one end you have
the product that never fails. On the other hand, you have the product that can be replaced infinitely,
but it's not as reliable. - Yep. - That downside of being
not as reliable comes from being infinitely repairable. But I think someone would argue that the downside of being
really hard to repair comes from being almost infinitely durable. - Sure, but they're not
always mutually exclusive. Like, those are kind of the bookends. So let me give you, like,
a couple of examples. I think a battery on an iPhone as being an important one. On an iPhone, on any phone,
a battery is something, if you want to extend
the life of the product, that's something that's gonna
need to be replaced, right? Batteries wear out. As we've been making
iPhones for a long time, in the early days, one
of the most common types of failures was water ingress, right? Where you drop it in a pool, or you, you know, spill your drink on it, and the unit fails. And so we've been making
strides over all those years to get better and better and better in terms of minimizing those failures. And I don't know how
many years it's been now, but we got to a point of IP68, which is kind of a
rating for water ingress, which is really impressive. And I think you get to
see some of these tests, right?
- Yeah. - And it's great because we
get these stories of people, you know, literally, I
dropped my phone in the lake. I couldn't get it for two weeks. I fished it out, it still
works. They're super excited. That said, to get the product there, you've gotta design a
lot of seals, adhesives, other things to make it perform that way, which makes it a little harder
to do that battery repair. You still need to do the battery repair, so we need to make sure we have a solution for customers to do that, which we do. But it's objectively
better for the customer to have that reliability. And it's ultimately better for the planet, because the failure rates since we got to that
point have just dropped. It's plummeted, right? The number of repairs that need to happen. And every time you're doing a repair, you're bringing in new materials, you know, to replace whatever broke. So you can actually do the math and figure out there's a threshold at which if I can make it this durable, then it's better to have it a
little bit harder to repair, 'cause it's gonna net out ahead. - So yeah, that checks out. I found that kind of interesting that we've never really heard anyone from Apple speak directly about this. Now, of course, in a dream world, if Apple's goal is to
make the ultimate phone that never ever breaks, then they probably shouldn't
be making it from glass. 'Cause in the words of
JerryRigEverything, glass is glass. Glass breaks. But still, they're trying to push as far towards that end as possible. And it is interesting to hear a little bit of the behind the scenes
on the philosophy there. But yeah, that's been it. That's my behind-the-scenes look at Apple's durability testing labs that we've never seen before. Make sure you subscribe to see more stuff, very cool, like this coming up soon, and let me know what you
think about this sliding scale of durability versus repair. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (relaxing upbeat music)"

become a global leader in artificial intelligence. It has enabled a cashless economy, where people make
purchases with their faces. A giant network of surveillance cameras with facial recognition helps
police monitor citizens. Meanwhile, some schools offer
glimpses of what the future of high tech education in
the country might look like. (speaking in foreign language) Classrooms have robots that
analyze students' health and engagement levels. Students wear uniforms with chips that track their locations. There are even surveillance
cameras that monitor how often students check their phones or yawn during classes. These gadgets have
alarmed Chinese netizens. (digital dinging) (quizzical music) (digital swishing) But, schools say it wasn't hard for them getting parental consent to enroll kids into what is one of the
worlds largest experiments in AI education. A program that's supposed
to boost students' grades while also feeding powerful algorithms. (speaking in foreign language) The government has poured
billions of dollars into the project. Bringing together tech
giants, start-ups and schools. (upbeat electronic music) We got exclusive access to
a primary school a few hours outside of Shanghai. (speaking in foreign language) To see firsthand how AI tech
is being used in the classroom. For this fifth grade class,
the day begins with putting on a brain wave sensing gadget. Students then practice meditating. (speaking in foreign language) The device is made in China
and has three electrodes, two behind the ears and
one on the forehead. These sensors pick up electrical signals sent by neurons in the brain. The neural data is then sent in real time to the teacher's computer, so while students are
solving math problems, a teacher can quickly find
out who's paying attention and who's not. (speaking in foreign language) A report is then generated
that shows how well the class was paying attention. It even details each
student's concentration level at 10 minute intervals. It's then sent to a
chat group for parents. (speaking in foreign language) The reports are detailed, but whether these devices really work and what they exactly
measure isn't as clear. (speaking in foreign language) We were curious if the headbands could actually measure concentration. So, one of our reporters
tried on the device. (speaking in foreign language) - This is a new technology with, still, fairly little research behind it. - [Presenter] Therodore
Zanto is a neural scientist at the University of
California San Francisco. He was surprised to learn that this tech, called electroencephalography,
also known as EEG, is being used in the
classroom on children. It's usually used by doctors
in hospitals and labs. - [Theodore] EEG is very
susceptible to artifacts and so, if you are itchy
or just a little fidgety or the EEG wasn't setup
properly, so that the electrodes didn't have a good contact,
effects the signal. - [Presenter] Despite the
chances for false readings, teachers told us the
headbands have forced students to become more disciplined. (dramatic piano music) (speaking in foreign language) Teachers say the students
now pay better attention during class and that has
made them study harder and achieve higher scores. (speaking in foreign language) But, not all students are as enthusiastic. (speaking in foreign language) This fifth grader, whom we
caught dozing off in class, told us his parents punish
him for low attention scores and that kind of data adds a new kind of pressure for students. (speaking in foreign language) Companies we interviewed
said the data can go to government funded research projects. We spoke to parents who were unclear about where the data ended up and they didn't seem to care too much. Zanto says, there's likely

Is this next video real or AI-generated? (timer ticking) Go ahead, take your time. (timer dings) So, that was a real video. That was a video from a YouTube channel. Now, what about this video?
Real or AI-generated? (soft electronic music) Okay, that one's AI-generated. Not a lot of giveaways, unless
you happen to have memorized the geographical landscape
around Mount Fuji and hunted for inconsistencies. But, okay, what about this one? And, yeah, you guessed it already. This one's AI-generated too. Okay, what about this one? Pay really close attention. Did you catch it? See, no, okay, that one was real, but the fact that you thought about it... So I, for the last week,
have had full access to the newest and most
advanced version of Sora, which is the AI video
generation tool from OpenAI. And the results that I've gotten from it are both horrifying and
inspiring at the same time. The last time I looked
at this, nine months ago, this was a very private
tool that was just unveiled. They were just starting
to show its capabilities, and so we were looking at
other people's prompts. Actually, basically, it was OpenAI's carefully hand-selected prompts for what they wanted to show us, and we could learn some stuff from that. But this time I just
get the controls myself. It's just an open text box. My wish is Sora's command, and that's actually kind
of a lot of pressure. You can type whatever you want. But I did not take this
responsibility lightly. I basically, over the past couple days, have been taking every possible angle of asking Sora to make things for me. I've asked for photorealistic things. I've asked for cartoon things. I've asked for objects, people, signs, actions, text, still life,
everything you can imagine. And I feel like I've come
away with a pretty good sense of what it's good at, what it's bad at, and what it could actually
be used for today. But this is a powerful tool that's about to be in the
hands of millions of people. So consider this the
first ever Sora review: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Let's jump in. So, first of all, this is the UI. On the left side, you
can explore other prompts that people have recently made, and then some featured ones where I suppose OpenAI
is still gonna curate some of the best results
to showcase what it can do. And if you hit the bookmark
button on any of these, they'll show up in your saved tab. And what I like about these, again, is anything you click on, you can see obviously who made it, but you can also read
exactly what they typed into the prompt box to get this result. And I'll get back to that in a second. So, then, underneath that
you have your library of all the videos I've
generated from Sora prompts, anything I've tagged as a
favorite from my own creations, and then uploads, which is any of the files
that I've uploaded to Sora for it to make videos out of, another crazy feature that
I'll get to in a second. But then, lastly, you have your folders, so you can organize
things that you've created into different folders, maybe for different projects or different themes or whatever, just to keep it somewhat organized. So, okay, right off the bat,
Sora is a tool after all, and so this feature of being able to see what other people are typing and then the results that
they create from those prompts is both for inspiration
but also for education, because it is really interesting reading how simple or how detailed
some of these prompts are and then looking at what Sora generated and what it took creative
liberties with to add on its own. And then if you really
like someone else's results but wanna adjust it in just a
slight way for your own use, there's the remix feature. So, you hit that button, and then you can describe specific changes you want it to make to that video for it to then generate a new one. So for this one, for example, I like this shot, and
the house is pretty cool, but I kind of want there
to be a golf course on those cliffs in the background, right? So, I type that, and then I
can also change the resolution, which, as you can see, it will take longer
for higher resolutions. And then you also can specify exactly how much of a remix it is, so if it's a subtle,
mild, or strong remix, which dictates basically how
much it's willing to change the results from the original. And then you can even
dial that in on a slider from one to eight if you want to. I think adding golf course would be nice, but I wanna keep those
cliffs and the house, so it's a mild change, right? Click ""remix"", wait a bit, and then, boom, you have the new creation, a fresh, new, artificially-generated video with that same house
and those same cliffs, but now 1080p and with a golf
course in the background. Wild. I've found that 360p
videos take, actually, very little time to generate. I do not want to use
the word ""create"" here. These are artificially-generated
from source material, but basically, a five-second, 360p video will generally take less
than 20 seconds to generate. And they're being generated
on OpenAI servers, so it has nothing to do with
the speed of my computer or even my internet connection. Once I send off the prompt,
it just takes that time, and then when it's done, it shows up, and I can download it if I want to. And then, something like
a 1080p, 10-second video, it looks significantly better, but it also takes much longer. It can take a couple of minutes for a really detailed
prompt and a 1080p video. And that's also right now, when almost no one else is using it. I kind of wonder how
much longer it'll take when this is just open for anyone to use. But that's roughly how long they've taken. And there's also the storyboard feature, which kind of looks and acts
like an online video editor where you can string
together several prompts. And it works best for stringing together several different actions in a row. Basically, I've noticed
it's hard to get a video to do several different
things in succession with a single prompt, but you can use their built-in editor to string several
prompts together in a row and then storyboard can help
you blend them all together into one longer video, and that actually can work better instead. So I've been playing with this all week, and I've been throwing dozens and dozens and dozens of prompts at it with all sorts of
characters, different styles, different unique things in the video. And so here are some observations that may surprise you, or maybe not. So, one, it seems like there
is no object permanence. So, we had AI-generated images, right? And they've gotten... You've seen the ark of them
getting better and better and higher resolution
and realistic over time. Now that we're doing videos, basically they're stringing together a bunch of different
AI-generated photos in a row with some sort of continuity. But for a video to make sense to a human, the objects kind of have
to move in certain ways and behave in certain
ways in the real world. And so one of the most
common dead giveaways from a flaw of an AI-generated video, especially with this tool, is just errors in object permanence. So you'll see things like objects passing in front of each
other or behind each other in ways that don't make sense. You'll see stuff disappear
or reappear out of thin air, especially if objects
pass in front of them, but even sometimes without
any real reason at all. They can also just
materialize and then vanish, like the smartphone in this
imaginary tech reviewer's hands. Boop, just gone. And there's also another
one that's really common. Anytime something with legs has to walk, if you just watch the
legs for long enough, they almost guaranteed will mess up which leg is the front
leg and which is the back. Just look at this one. Just try to watch one of the legs, and you'll see it happens. It switches back and forth from the front leg to the back leg. This is super common. It happens all the time in these. And that brings me to another one of my biggest observations, which is it just struggles
with physics in general, the way things move, which actually makes perfect sense, because physics would seem
to require some understanding of what you're making a video about. So, in the same way that
large language models can struggle with hallucinations or putting together sentences
that are technically incorrect or don't quite make sense, these video models will also struggle with putting together videos where the movement of the objects, since it doesn't know
that they're objects, sometimes also doesn't really make sense. Pretty much anytime I try
anything remotely photorealistic, basically, you instantly notice that the movements don't look right. It tends to look kind of
slow motiony, actually, but then other parts
won't be in slow motion, which our eye picks up on right away. I was playing with making
like CCTV-style footage. 'cause in my head, that's gonna be the easiest thing to fake. People are gonna get their hands on this, they're gonna fake security
camera footage all the time. But even in this, you can see the movement of the
humans is just slightly off. First it's a little slow,
then it's fast for no reason. It's just weird. Now, it seems to be decent sometimes at fluid dynamics for whatever reason. I've been very impressed
with some examples of water rippling or crashing in waves, or moving in realistic waves. It does happen sometimes. It can be actually pretty good-looking. And same thing also with fire. Sometimes it can look pretty realistic, even if the smoke isn't. But, yeah, physics in general
is definitely a weakness. So then, if you know this, you can mess more with
claymation or cartoon style, and then those irregularities
and movement or physics become a lot easier to palate, because it feels more
like a stylistic choice or an artistic choice. But I'll get to the stuff
that it actually does really well in a second. But there is another feature that you might have seen around
the internet a little bit with some other tools like this that takes a source image and can turn it into
a video with a prompt. So, people have been
bringing memes to life and imagining what would happen right after some iconic image, just by typing into the AI video generator and asking Sora what it would look like, and Sora can do that too. The difference with Sora, I've found, is it's way less likely to try anything that it recognizes as
having any copyrighted or intellectual property whatsoever. It's pretty picky. It actually does reject a lot of stuff. Anything with any public figures or recognizing characters
in general, or logos, it actually refuses to do it. It will also refuse if
it thinks any subject you upload in the image
is under 18 years old. Makes sense. But I did upload this AI-generated image, which Dolly made, and asked it to make them
all singing and dancing, and hit ""generate"", and it totally did it. Again, it helps a lot that
they are cartoon styled and not some super realistic scene, but this is a totally AI-generated video. I also tried a few other
images from my camera roll, And these just... It just gets weird. It just doesn't know the context of what direction any object
was moving in the photo. Again, it doesn't know physics, and so things just get really wonky. It's impressive that
it's AI-generated video, but you can tell pretty quickly that it's AI-generated video. So, all that being said, we've seen what it's good at, we've seen what it's not so good at, and you might be wondering,
what is this tool actually for? And I actually found a few
things that are not so scary that are actually pretty good at. So, these are the things that
I found, as of right now, that Sora can be used for. Abstracts. So, you can be as descriptive as you want and create all sorts of textures
and colors and gradients to make an abstract shape move around in a way that essentially looks like it could be a screensaver or just some background
piece or whatever you want. I'm sure there's a world
where someone's gonna make an NFT out of this stuff. Also totally weird. But you can do abstract stuff for sure. I noticed it's getting
better at reproducing text, especially when you ask
it for specific text. So, there are sometimes
background garbled text in these videos, and that's
gonna continue to happen, but I've found that, if I asked it for an individual
title slide in a style, it actually could give me the
correct text on that slide. This animation it gave me of sketching the Empire State Building, this would make a killer title slide or even an intro to a documentary about the building, or Manhattan,
or something like that. I was very impressed. And then stop motion or
cartoon-style characters. Again, like I said before, cartoons don't necessarily have to have realistic movements or physics, so the errors in those things
don't hit the eye as much, and so the characters still
look like, dare I say, art. They're characters. Especially in scenes like this one. The graffiti doesn't have
to actually say real words for this to look normal. The bear doesn't have to
have the correct number of fingers or toes. It just looks like some album
art come to life, basically, which I'm sure someone would find useful on social media somewhere. And while we're at it, here's a couple other random
prompts that impressed me. I asked for Santa fighting
Frosty the Snowman in the style of ""Mortal Kombat"", and it built a readable scoreboard. I didn't ask for the scoreboard, but it built all that, with
the names in everything, which is pretty crazy. Immediately, again, the details are weird when you start looking at it, but this could be a good
inspirational starting point. And then I also asked for a video of a tech reviewer sitting at a desk, and I said, nothing about this fake plant, but Sora took the liberty of adding this exact fake plant here, which I said nothing about in my prompt. And that is a convenient reminder of the other side of the tools like this, the unknown behind a lot of the tools. Clearly we already know that
these are AI-generated videos that have to come from
some source material. Are my videos in that source material? Is this exact plant part
of the source material? Is it just a coincidence? I don't know. OpenAI has talked about
using publicly available media and data, and it's always, to me, been kind of a sketchy definition. We don't know if it's everything. We don't know if it's too late to opt out, if we wanted to opt out. And also, I have no idea
how much energy this uses or if it is significantly more than the LLMs or Dolly we're using. But still, the craziest
part of all of this is the fact that this tool, Sora, is going to be available to the public, I guess around the time
of this video publish, to everyone, to millions
of people all at once. And I mean, yes, it does a
pretty good job with guardrails of refusing to do anything photorealistic, refusing to use actual people's likenesses or any dangerous or harmful acts. And, yes, it does watermark
every single generated video with this little animation
here in the corner. But you can still crop watermarks. And it's still an extremely powerful tool that directly moves us
further into the era of not being able to believe
anything you see online. I mean, read through the
comments on my last video about AI-generated video. This is a lot for humanity
to digest right now. All of that, and these
videos don't even have audio. They're just a few seconds
long. They're just 1080p. This is the new baseline. This is, once again, the
worst that they will be as they continue to get
better in the future. It's a lot to think about. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (light percussion music) Real quick, thanks to Ridge for sponsoring this portion of the video and for supporting the channel. Just as a PSA, we're coming
up on that time of year where we're perfectly in the middle of we should rush to get good holiday gifts. We're kind of running out of time. Lucky for you, Ridge is running
a holiday sale right now where they're doing up to 40% off. And you guys know one of the
reasons I partner with them is because they have
actually high-quality gear. So that's one of the things I'm gonna be doing for this year, is getting gifts from Ridge for people. And I think I actually haven't
gotten Andrew his gift yet, so hopefully he doesn't
watch this part of the video, but I think I'm gonna get him, since he's a hiker, one
of the Ridge knives. But don't tell him. But whatever you end up getting, if you slide over to ridge.com/mkbhd, that's where you'll be able to find everything that's on sale
and everything Ridge does. So, shout out to them again and catch you guys in the next video. Peace."

of advanced technology in ancient Egypt invites us to reconsider
the narrative of human progress and the linear model
of technological evolution. It raises profound questions about
the transmission of knowledge, the potential for lost technologies, and the remarkable ingenuity
of ancient civilizations. In this documentary, we will examine
some of the most compelling cases of advanced ancient technology
found in Egypt, delving into the evidence
of sophisticated engineering, acoustics,
and possibly even electricity. The Osirion. The Osirion, a monumental
ancient structure in Abydos, approximately 350 miles south
of the Great Pyramid of Giza, remains a subject
of profound mystery and debate. Its architectural sophistication
and unique characteristics have led some to speculate
that it might be the product of a much older,
advanced ancient civilization possessing technology far beyond
what is traditionally attributed to the Egyptians
of the Pharaonic era. One of the first puzzles
the Osirion poses is its architectural design, which deviates significantly
from the typical temple structure found in ancient Egypt. Unlike the linear, rectangular layout
common to most Egyptian temples, the Osirion features
a complex, L-shaped configuration. This anomaly raises questions about the intentions
behind its design and construction. Further complicating matters
is the Osirion's relationship with the Temple of Seti I, as it appears to predate the latter, suggesting it was a significant site long before Seti I
decided to build his temple adjacent to it. The sheer scale of the Osirion
is breathtaking. Massive rose granite blocks, some weighing 100 tons
form the core of this structure. These colossal stones
were quarried from Aswan, located a staggering
200 miles away. The logistical challenges involved
in moving these massive blocks across such distances, only to be placed in a desert location
several miles from the Nile, are monumental. The transportation and placement
of these enormous blocks defy the capabilities
attributed to ancient Egyptians. The question then arises: How were these gigantic stones
moved and precisely placed without any known evidence
of advanced machinery? The architecture of the Osirion
further fuels this enigma. The site, featuring a complex,
double-layered roofing system and about a dozen chambers, showcases a level
of architectural sophistication that seems out of reach
for a civilization equipped with primitive tools. Such complexity, particularly the interlocking wedges and precision in stacking
the massive blocks, suggests a level
of engineering knowledge not typically associated
with ancient Egypt. The use of granite, a material
far more challenging to work with than the more
commonly used limestone, indicates a technological prowess
that the ancient Egyptians, as far as historical records show, did not possess. Another mystery of the site is that
it lacks any Egyptian hieroglyphs, arts, or artifacts. Absolutely nothing can link this site
to the ancient Egyptians. All throughout the history of Egypt, temples and monuments
built by the Egyptians were regularly renovated, and with each renovation, additional artworks and hieroglyphs
were added. Yet in the Osirion, we don't see anything like that. Furthermore, the Osirion's subterranean layout is highly unusual
for Egyptian temple architecture. It is situated
15 feet below the ground level, a feature that is both
unique and puzzling. Some researchers propose that
this could be due to the temple being much older
than the surrounding structures, possibly predating
the sands and soil that have accumulated
over millennia. There are also
water erosion patterns found on the limestone enclosure
around the site, which some researchers argue
could only have occurred if the structure was built
before the end of the last Ice Age, a time when the climate in the region
was much wetter. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect
of the Osirion is its subterranean nature and the presence of water. Modern seismic technology
has revealed that the structure extends
at least 50 feet, or 15 meters below
the current floor level, suggesting that what is visible today is merely the uppermost portion
of a much larger construction. Moreover, seismic tests indicated the presence of hollow chambers
within this depth. Just imagine what is hidden inside
these underground chambers. Archaeologists
still can't explore these depths due to the water
that can't be pumped out as it constantly refills. The Osirion's hydraulic system
is characterized by an intricate network of channels, basins, and possibly sluices, designed to control and manipulate
the flow of water within the complex. The precision in the design
and execution of these features indicates a deep understanding
of hydraulic engineering principles, including water flow dynamics
and pressure management. Comparative analysis with known
Dynastic Egyptian technology reveals stark differences in the sophistication
of water management techniques. While the Egyptians
were skilled in utilizing the Nile for agriculture through
basic irrigation canals and basins, the complexity and precision
observed in the Osirion's hydraulics are unparalleled in other
contemporaneous Egyptian works. This discrepancy raises questions about the origins of such
advanced engineering knowledge, suggesting the involvement
of a civilization with a higher degree
of technological advancement than previously recognized. James Westerman, a researcher, historian,
and archaeologist, has dedicated several decades to studying the mysteries
of the Osirion. To study what's hidden
beneath the water, Westerman decided
to pump out the water with a powerful pump capable of removing
500 gallons of water per minute, which is around 1,900 liters. Shockingly, the water level
continued to replenish itself at a rate that outpaced
the pumping capacity. The source and mechanism
of the water's emergence remained a mystery. In the words of Westerman: ""Somehow water is emerging
from inside this structure. That's unique. There shouldn't be water
coming out of the desert, especially pressurized water. There's something strange
going on there."" In 2023, Westerman's team
employed advanced technology that was able to monitor
pressure, temperature, conductivity, and chemical properties
of the water in the Osirion and he compared the results with
the surrounding wells in the area. Preliminary results showed
that the water within the Osirion indeed possesses
unique characteristics, and came from
a different source or pathway compared to
the other local water sources. In his words: ""I have determined through research
that water flowing into the Osirion is different from ambient water
at this location. The Osirion's water has a different
chemical composition and isotropic profile. Why? The water is under pressure
and flows into the Osirion as though it were being forced up
through rock like a geyser, but water is not reaching
the Osirion through bedrock. What is propelling it? My research so far indicates that
the water in the Osirion is unique, it is not coming
from the local aquifer or from the Nile River
several miles away. Further scientific investigation will help me determine
where its coming from."" Hydrologic studies show that the water in the Osirion
was drinkable, and after filtering it, Westerman
started drinking the water, stating that it did not have
any predominant taste. He continuously drank from
the filtered water from the Osirion, and after some time, something remarkable happened. He experienced an unexpected
improvement in his eyesight, and although he has been
nearsighted since he was a kid, after taking an eye test, it was determined
he no longer needed glasses. Ever since, Westerman continues
to drink this water, believing in its healing properties. Another anomaly about the water was a strange temperature
fluctuation that wasn't natural. It was as if something was heating
the water beneath the Osirion. The water surrounding the structure
is measured at 16.9°C or 62.5°F, while remarkably, the water within the pipe
registers at 23.8°C or 74.8°F. This presents a notable deviation which seems to contravene
the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat
cannot spontaneously transfer from a cooler to a warmer body. This suggests
that some unknown force is warming the water inside the pipe despite it being enveloped
by cooler water. No one knows where and what
is the source of the water, how it replenishes so quickly
in the middle of the Egyptian desert, and what is the scale
of the entire complex that is now underground. The Djed Pillar. The Djed pillar and the Ankh
are iconic symbols of ancient Egypt. While separated
by thousands of years and vastly different
cultural contexts, a comparison of the Djed pillar and
Tesla's technological innovations reveals a striking similarity. The Djed pillar, with its distinctive appearance
featuring a broad base, a column-like body, and multiple
horizontal bars at the top, holds a revered place in ancient Egyptian
mythology and iconography. It is often interpreted as a symbol
of stability and regeneration, closely associated
with the god Osiris. In the mythological and religious
context of ancient Egypt, the Djed was a potent symbol
of the enduring nature of life and the order of the universe. Comparing the Djed pillar
to Tesla's technology might seem far-fetched
at first glance. However, the comparison
becomes intriguing when considering the symbolic
representation of energy and power in both contexts. The Djed pillar, as a symbol of stability
and regeneration, can be metaphorically linked to the concept
of continuous energy flow and the perpetual cycle
of life and renewal. Tesla's work, particularly his experimentation
with wireless energy and electromagnetic fields, resonates with this idea of a continuous,
omnipresent source of power. Some speculative theories
suggest that the Djed pillar could represent
an ancient knowledge of electrical power or energy, drawing parallels to Tesla's vision of harnessing
and distributing energy. These theories propose
that the Djed, with its columnar shape
and horizontal bars, bears a resemblance
to components of electrical systems or devices used
for energy transmission. Zawyet El Aryan. The mysterious site
of Zawyet El Aryan, situated between
the Giza Plateau and Abu Sir, has been a subject of considerable
intrigue and speculation, particularly due to the fact
that the Egyptian government restricted access to this site
and completely buried it, denying any
archaeological investigations. The only information we have
about this incredible site is from Egyptologist
Allesandro Barsanti, who investigated the site
in the early 20th century before access to the site
was completely restricted. The level of
architectural sophistication evident at Zawyet El Aryan has given rise to theories suggesting
that it may have been built by a technologically
advanced civilization, possibly predating
the conventional timeline of ancient Egyptian history. The primary structure
at Zawyet El Aryan is often referred to as
the Unfinished Pyramid. It consists of a square base measuring approximately
650 feet on each side, with a deep, T-shaped central shaft
cut into the bedrock. This shaft, which descends
about 100 feet below ground level, is an engineering marvel in itself, considering the hardness
of the bedrock and the precision required
to excavate such a structure. The precision and scale
of this excavation pose significant questions
about the tools and technologies available to the ancient Egyptians. The conventional understanding
of Egyptian toolsets, primarily composed
of copper and stone tools, seems inadequate to undertake such an ambitious
and precise project. Theories suggesting
that Zawyet El Aryan was built by a technologically
advanced civilization are fueled by several factors. Firstly, the precision of the excavation work
is extraordinary, with the shaft's walls being almost
perfectly vertical and smooth. This level of precision
suggests the use of advanced surveying equipment
and cutting tools, possibly hinting at a level
of technological sophistication not yet acknowledged
in ancient Egyptian history. The argument is further supported by the lack of any hieroglyphics
or inscriptions at the site, which is unusual
for Egyptian monumental structures and leaves the pyramid's purpose
and the identity of its builders shrouded in mystery. The strange thing about the site was that the pit
was intentionally filled with a tangled mass
of heavy limestone blocks, hinting at a deliberate effort
to conceal or protect whatever lay beneath. After excavating
the limestone blocks with which the site was buried, Barsanti and his team found a massive foundation
of pink granite blocks, which differed from the previously
uncovered limestone blocks. One of these blocks was enormous, weighing around 30 tons. The discovery of this granite block, along with subsequent findings
of more granite blocks and an enormous
30-ton pink granite block forming the foundation
of a sort of pavement, led Barsanti to believe
that he had found the entrance to a subterranean world, possibly filled with untold treasures
or significant historical artifacts. One of the most
remarkable discoveries at the Zawyet El Aryan site was a large oval vat
made of pink granite, polished like a mirror and intricately carved
out of one of the pavement blocks. The vat's protection, involving a layer of lime
and a thick bed of well-spread clay, suggests it held great importance, possibly containing something
of value or significance. The side walls of the vat
were lined with a black band, possibly the residue of some liquid, pointing to its use
in a unique and unknown process. The vat's design and the evident efforts
to preserve its integrity suggest it was an integral part
of a sophisticated process, possibly related to
energy generation or storage. During the excavation of the site
by Barsanti and his team in 1905, a massive storm hit Egypt
and the pit at Zawyet El Aryan. The torrential rains filled the pit
with over 10 feet of water. Incredibly,
a few hours after the storm, the water level in the pit
abruptly dropped. Surely, Barsanti asserted, this must be because the water
was seeping down into some sort of subterranean chamber, into the hidden apartments
he believed were waiting to be found
beneath the pit. Between the weight of the blocks, the cement-like mortar,
and the interlocking pattern, the work was the most difficult
his team had ever undertaken. But to Barsanti,
this only proved his point. Surely,
whoever had constructed the site had gone to such great lengths to make the blocks of the floor
unmovable because they were meant
to conceal a hiding place, something extremely important. Unfortunately, the work
was so difficult that, again, Barsanti ran out of money
before he could solve the mystery. Then World War I broke out, shutting the sites of Egypt down
to further exploration. In 1917, Barsanti unexpectedly died
at the age of 59. Rather than continue
Barsanti's work, Egyptologists
simply forgot about the site, leaving the mystery
of what lay beneath it unsolved. The sudden restriction of access
to the Zawyet El Aryan site by the Egyptian government
in the 1960s, just as interest in its mysteries
was renewed, only deepens the intrigue. A military base
now stands over the site, and no one can enter it. While definitive proof
remains elusive, the architectural complexities and unexplained features
of the Zawyet El Aryan site, coupled with its proximity
to the Great Pyramid, suggest that it may have been part of an advanced
technological system for energy generation
and distribution in ancient Egypt. The Saqqara Bird. The Saqqara Bird, an artifact found in 1898 within the confines
of the Saqqara necropolis, has stirred the imagination
and curiosity of many. This object,
which is over 2,000 years old, is made of sycamore wood and measures about 14 centimeters
or 5 and half inches in length. At first glance,
it resembles a bird. However, upon closer examination, its features provoke speculation that it could represent
something far more sophisticated – an ancient model of an aircraft. The artifact features a flat body, wings that are straight
and aerodynamically shaped, and what appears to be
a rudder or tail fin, characteristics that are
strikingly similar to modern aircraft rather than
the typical representations of birds in ancient Egyptian art. Unlike other avian figurines
found from ancient Egypt, which typically emphasize
detailed plumage and anatomical accuracy, the Saqqara Bird has a vertical tail, a feature that is absent
in depictions of birds but crucial in the design of aircraft
for stability and control. But another crucial thing
about this artifact, is the place where it was found. Ancient Egyptians meticulously
placed items within tombs for practical reasons – models of real-life objects
intended to assist or transport the deceased
in the afterlife. Given this context, the Saqqara Bird's presence
raises intriguing questions. Unlike the practical,
everyday items typically found, an aircraft would serve
a unique purpose, aligning with the belief
that the dead ascended to the skies. Could this carving, then,
represent a scale model of an actual ancient aircraft? The Saqqara Bird's
distinct vertical tail fin, absent in natural avian anatomy, hints at an understanding
of stabilization mechanisms essential for flight. However, for true
aerodynamic efficiency, a horizontal tail fin is critical – a feature the Saqqara Bird
does not possess. Or does it? Upon closer examination, we can see a series of marks, which many believe
were where such a fin might have once been attached. Modern technological tools
were used to simulate and test the aerodynamic properties
of the Saqqara Bird, enhanced with a hypothetical
horizontal tail fin, through computer flight simulators. The results
from this high-tech analysis were nothing short of astonishing. The Saqqara Bird, when modeled
with a horizontal tail fin, exhibits remarkable
gliding capabilities, adhering to
principles of aerodynamics that weren't formally understood
until the 19th century. This revelation suggests that the ancient Egyptians'
conceptualization of flight could have been more advanced
than previously acknowledged, presenting a design that,
in some aspects, surpasses the initial models
of modern gliders. The Serapeum of Saqqara. The Serapeum of Saqqara
is an ancient Egyptian necropolis located near Cairo, which is renowned
for its assemblage of massive granite boxes believed to be sarcophagi. These boxes, crafted with astonishing precision, have sparked considerable debate
about their creation. The extraordinary craftsmanship
evident in these granite boxes suggests the use
of advanced technology, far beyond what is traditionally
attributed to the ancient Egyptians. Each box
in the Serapeum of Saqqara is hewn from
a single piece of granite, a material known for
its extreme hardness. The boxes are enormous, with some weighing up to 70 tons, including the lid and base. This means that the blocks
from which they were carved would have been weighing
around 200 tons. The precision with which
these boxes have been crafted is remarkable – their corners are perfectly square, and the flat surfaces
are exquisitely smooth, with an accuracy that rivals
modern machining capabilities. This level of precision, achieved several millennia ago, is astounding and has led to the speculation that the ancient Egyptians
had access to advanced technology, possibly lost to time. One of the most striking features
of these boxes is their interior surfaces, which are equally precise
and smooth as the exteriors. Achieving such accuracy
on the inside of a stone box, particularly with the tools
supposedly available at the time, seems impossible. The walls of the boxes
are of uniform thickness, suggesting the use of sophisticated
measuring and cutting equipment. This level of uniformity
and precision in stonecraft is rarely found
in other ancient Egyptian artifacts, leading to questions about
the technology and methods used in their construction. Moreover, the process of hollowing out
these massive granite blocks would have required
significant understanding and control
of stonecutting techniques. The conventional tools
of the ancient Egyptians, primarily made of copper, would have been inadequate
for shaping such hard stone with the precision observed. This discrepancy has fueled theories suggesting that the builders
of the Serapeum possessed advanced
technological knowledge, potentially
including high-speed drills, diamond-tipped cutting tools,
or other sophisticated machinery. Another aspect
that intrigues researchers is the purpose of these boxes. Traditionally
believed to be sarcophagi for the burial of sacred Apis bulls, this explanation
has been questioned due to the boxes' elaborate
and precise construction, which seems excessive
for mere burial purposes. Some theorists propose that
these boxes were used for purposes that required precise dimensions
and smooth surfaces, perhaps related to some form
of energy manipulation or scientific process
unknown to modern science. Additionally, the granite boxes
also possess acoustic properties. The transportation and placement
of these massive boxes are also subjects of wonder. The Serapeum's
underground tunnels are narrow and winding, making the movement of such
large objects a logistical challenge. Also, why are there
no signs of torches such as burn marks anywhere
in the Serapeum of Saqqara? What kind of lighting did they use to illuminate
these underground spaces? In contrast to these theories, mainstream archaeology
attributes the precision and craftsmanship
of the granite boxes to the skill and patience
of ancient craftsmen, who, over generations, perfected
their stone-working techniques. Critics of
the advanced technology theory argue that there is no direct
archaeological evidence supporting the existence
of machinery or tools sophisticated enough to create
these boxes in ancient Egypt. Creating such precision
in ancient times would have required not only advanced tools but also
a sophisticated understanding of engineering and geometry. The scale and precision
of the boxes in the Serapeum are not replicated
in any modern granite quarries, indicating that the ancient Egyptians, or perhaps a pre-existing civilization, had access to
technology and knowledge that are not yet fully understood. The Schist Disk. The Schist Disk
is a remarkable artifact discovered in the ancient
burial ground of Saqqara. The disk stands out
due to its unique characteristics. Measuring approximately two
to two-and-a-half feet in diameter, it exhibits
a remarkable craftsmanship that has intrigued scholars. Its intricate design
features a series of precise, concentric circular patterns
with a central hub, reminiscent of a wheel or gear. This intricacy and precision
in its makeup led many to suggest
that it could be a remnant of a lost ancient technology or even part
of an advanced mechanical device. The disk is notably
composed of quartzite, a material known for its hardness, rated 7 out of 10
on the hardness scale. This fact alone has led to questions
about its creation, as the dynastic Egyptians of the time are not believed
to have had the technology to work with such hard materials. Mainstream historians
say it was used for directing water; however, the three lobes featured
by the disk are not angled in a way that would suggest a function
in moving or directing water. Instead, it appears to have been
part of a rotating mechanism around a central axis. The craftsmanship displayed
in the disk is extraordinary, with thin blades or petals
extending from the central hub, each uniformly shaped
and symmetrically arranged. Adding to its enigmatic nature are the curious burn marks
found on the disk. These marks have not been
definitively explained, contributing to
the overall mystery of the artifact and linking
it even more to the theory that it was part of a larger
mechanical device or machine. Some have hypothesized
that it might have been part of an ancient
timekeeping device, an astronomical instrument, or a piece of machinery
used for unknown purposes. Other artifacts
that some connect to the disk are these three pieces, which look very much
like some sort of gear parts that were once part
of a mechanical device. The speculation that the Schist Disk
and these gear parts were a remnant
of advanced technology is fueled by comparisons with artifacts
from other ancient civilizations known for their
engineering prowess. The intricate design of these pieces bears some resemblance
to components found in later technological artifacts, such as the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek device used
for tracking celestial movements. This resemblance has led to theories suggesting a shared knowledge
of mechanical engineering among ancient civilizations, possibly hinting at a now-lost
advanced technological tradition. The Valley Temple of Khafre. The Valley Temple of Khafre, an integral component of
the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, is a marvel of ancient
engineering and architecture. This temple is among
the best-preserved ancient structures in Egypt, having remained nearly intact
for thousands of years, largely due to being buried
under sand until the 19th century. Its construction exhibits a level
of sophistication and precision that many argue
could only have been achieved through the use
of advanced technology. Constructed with massive blocks
of limestone and red granite, some weighing over 150 tons, the temple showcases a level
of engineering sophistication that is completely out of place. The supermassive stones are
a hallmark of the temple's grandeur, raising questions
about the methods used in their transportation and assembly. The Valley Temple's
construction technique, involving the precise fitting
of massive stones without the use of mortar, is awe-inspiring. The temple's walls
are assembled with such precision that they resemble a complex
three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. The manipulation of these stones,
with their various exposed surfaces, corners, and angles, shows a level of skill
and understanding of stonecraft that is nothing short
of extraordinary. In addition to that, the incredible 'bent' stones
in the interior present a compelling enigma, raising questions about
the use of advanced technology in ancient times. These stones, seamlessly integrated
into the structure, appear as if they have been
skillfully shaped or bent, defying
the conventional understanding of ancient stonemasonry. This remarkable feat
prompts us to question: How was it possible
for ancient builders to manipulate such massive stones
with such precision? Could there have been
advanced technologies or lost methods at play, enabling them
to shape these stones in ways that seem
almost impossible with known tools of the era? One of the most intriguing aspects
of the Valley Temple is a large black granite block
on the internal eastern wall, which differs from the rest
of the pink granite wall. Its placement and purpose
remain a mystery, with some speculating
it could mark an entrance to a subterranean passage. Despite common beliefs
that the temple was used for the mummification process and purification of Pharaoh Khafre
before his burial, there is a lack of concrete evidence
supporting this claim. Some researchers,
examining the style of stonework, suggest that the temple
could be far older than what dynastic history indicates. The temple is devoid
of paintings and inscriptions, a characteristic it shares
with the pyramids. What shocked many was the Valley Temple's
resemblance to structures found in distant lands, such as Peru. The similarity in design elements
between the temple and sites like Ollantaytambo and the Coricancha temple in Peru
is uncanny, leading to speculation
about the interconnectedness of these ancient civilizations. This resemblance
has fueled debates about the possibility
of a shared blueprint or knowledge
among these distant cultures, a hypothesis that remains
a tantalizing mystery. Research led by figures
like John Anthony West, Robert Schoch, and Andrew Collins
suggests that the Valley Temple, along with the Sphinx Temple, are among the oldest structures
on the Giza Plateau, possibly over 10,000 years old. The Dagger of Tutankhamun. On November 26, 1922, a monumental moment
in archaeological history unfolded as British archaeologist
Howard Carter, accompanied by Lord Carnarvon, penetrated the sealed chambers
of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. Untouched for millennia, the tomb was a treasure trove, brimming with golden artifacts
and decorations. This discovery, one of the most significant
archaeological finds to date, opened a window into the opulence
and mystery of ancient Egypt. In another video of ours, we discussed in detail
the strange deaths that followed everyone
connected to this discovery, starting with Lord Carnarvon who died four months
after the discovery. In the following years, seven members of the expedition
died mysteriously, leading many to believe
they were cursed. But let's get back
to the artifacts found in the tomb. Among the myriad of treasures,
the most intriguing was Tutankhamun's
collection of daggers, particularly an iron dagger
with a gold sheath and handle, discovered alongside the young
pharaoh's mummified remains. This dagger, with its exquisite craftsmanship
and unusual material, sparked intense interest and debate among historians
and archaeologists. The golden sheath and handle
were typical of the grandeur associated with Egyptian royalty, but it was the iron blade
that was truly extraordinary. In an era dominated by bronze, the presence of iron – a material more precious
than gold at the time – was an anomaly. The Egyptians, renowned for their work
with copper, bronze, and gold, were not known for iron smelting, which became prevalent
only in the first millennium BC, centuries after Tutankhamun's reign. The dagger's quality
further deepened the mystery. It was later discovered
that the dagger is actually made from a meteorite iron, which makes it
even more extraordinary. How was such
a sophisticated artifact produced? The Egyptians themselves
attributed the dagger's origin to divine intervention, calling it a gift from the gods. This notion fuels speculation
about the dagger being a product of a more advanced civilization or perhaps an extraterrestrial gift. Mainstream Egyptologists,
confronted with this enigma, proposed that the Egyptians simply
extracted the iron from a meteorite that had fallen somewhere in Egypt. This theory, while plausible, has its shortcomings. Extracting metal from a meteoroid, especially in the Bronze Age, was beyond Egyptian capabilities. Moreover, meteoritic iron is scattered
throughout the meteoroid, making extraction without
advanced technology impossible. In 1994, X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry analysis revealed that the dagger's blade
was not ordinary meteoritic iron. The alloy was complex and durable, comprising 89% iron
with significant amounts of nickel, cobalt, and chromium – a composition requiring
advanced metallurgical skills, unavailable until much later
in human history. The dagger's craftsmanship
was equally baffling. It lacked any hammer marks, common in metalwork of the period, and its edges
were exceptionally precise. This level of sophistication
in metallurgy and craftsmanship seemed out of place
in the context of Bronze Age Egypt. Intriguingly, Tutankhamun's tomb also housed
other mysterious artifacts, like a breastplate
adorned with a winged scarab made from an unusual
yellow-green gemstone – initially thought to be
chalcedony quartz. Later investigations
revealed it to be desert glass, a material formed
under extremely high temperatures. The presence of such material,
alongside the iron dagger, added to the enigma
of Tutankhamun's artifacts. The desert glass,
first discovered in the Libyan desert, resembles trinitite, a type of glass formed
during nuclear tests in New Mexico, suggesting extreme heat
was involved in its creation. This discovery led to theories
about ancient nuclear events or advanced ancient technologies
capable of producing such heat – far beyond the known capabilities
of Bronze Age civilizations. These findings
compel us to reevaluate our understanding of ancient history. The technological sophistication
evident in Tutankhamun's artifacts suggests knowledge and skills far surpassing what is historically
attributed to ancient civilizations. Were these gifts from an advanced,
perhaps extraterrestrial civilization, or remnants of a highly advanced,
yet lost human civilization? The Tanis Cataclysm. Tanis, an ancient city that once lay in the northeastern delta
of the Nile in Egypt, is a site shrouded
in mystery and intrigue. It was a thriving metropolis
during various periods of the ancient Egyptian civilization. Despite its significant historical role, Tanis remained
shrouded in obscurity until a team of French archaeologists
unearthed it in 1939 after twelve years
of meticulous excavation. The discovery revealed
a scene of profound devastation. Massive statues,
obelisks, and stone blocks, some originating
from the Aswan quarry over a thousand miles away, were found scattered and shattered. Among these ruins
was a fragmented statue, believed to be once part
of the largest statue ever created from a single piece of granite. The Colossi of Memnon are two massive stone statues
located on the west bank of the Nile near Luxor. They are about 60 feet tall
or 18 meters and are estimated to weigh
around 720 tons. Based on the size
of the foot fragment found at Tanis, the full statue
is believed to be double the size of the Colossi of Memnon, making it around 120 feet tall
and weighing 1,400 tons. This led to pressing questions: How were these enormous stones
transported over such distances, and what cataclysmic event
could have caused such widespread destruction? Adding to the enigma of Tanis
is its barren landscape, almost devoid of vegetation, a stark contrast
to the surrounding delta's fertility. This peculiarity
becomes more intriguing when considering Tanis's
biblical identity as the city of Zoan. Biblical verses describe
the destruction of Egyptian idols and the laying waste of Upper Egypt, including setting fire to Zoan. Curiously, some of the granite stones at Tanis bear evidence
of intense heat exposure, suggesting a catastrophic event
involving extreme temperatures. The nature of the damage suggested
an event of extraordinary power far beyond the capability of any known
ancient human-made fires or traditional warfare techniques
of the time. The colossal statues
were blown away and scattered around the site, broken to pieces
by the immense force. Archaeological excavations
at Tanis have revealed that much of the city's remains were
buried under 10 to 20 feet of soil, indicating that whatever caused
the massive destruction also buried the site in the ground, completely erasing it
from the face of the world. This pattern of destruction
aligns with the theory of an external, natural force
wreaking havoc on the site, possibly a plasma ejection
from the sun, as suggested by Dr. Schoch. This catastrophic event might have not only vaporized
any living beings in the area but also dramatically altered
the landscape, covering the ancient city
with debris and soil. But the cataclysm of Tanis
is not the only mystery of the site. The numerous obelisks,
artifacts, and colossal statues, all made from granite, made many researchers
like Brien Foerster believe they were built
using lost high technology. There are also numerous obliterated
remains of obelisks at the site, more than
any other location in Egypt. These obelisks were often theorized
to be part of an energetic system, possibly linked
to the pyramids of Giza. Perhaps some sort of malfunction
in this energetic system caused the city's destruction. The Unfinished Obelisk at Aswan. This gigantic piece of granite
lies in the southern part of Egypt, right next to the Nile River. It was left behind
thousands of years ago in the Aswan quarries, abandoned due to a crack. It was never relocated or erected, although it was clearly meant to be. It measures an impressive
137 feet in length and weighs about 1,170 tons, which, if completed, would have made it
the largest single-stone monument ever created by the Egyptians. In Aswan, which is a city essentially perched
on a giant granite outcrop, there are numerous features
in the quarry that indicate the use
of advanced technology that could manipulate
the hard granite. For example, we can find strange,
perfectly round holes, which some say are test holes
to check the condition of the granite in the deeper layers before committing
to cutting a huge obelisk. These strange holes
are completely smooth without any signs of chisels or tools. They look almost as if they were
drilled with modern technology. One of these holes is enormous,
almost 30 feet deep. Moreover, we can see
perfectly straight vertical walls, which are very unusual considering
their massive size and perfection. Some believe
that this gigantic wall was made after an even larger obelisk block
was extracted from the quarry. But how is this possible? What kind of technology
could shape and cut hard granite in such a precise way? Moreover,
how were the massive granite blocks and obelisks transported? If we go to
the unfinished obelisk itself, we can find even stranger marks
on the granite surface. The surface of this
massive granite slab is adorned with smooth,
hollowed-out areas, giving the appearance
that the granite was ""scooped out"" from the obelisk. The term ""scoop"" actually comes from
several researchers who studied the structure and couldn't find
a better explanation than this, saying that the rock
seems to have been scooped out like a spoon would do
with ice cream. Notably, the sides of the obelisk also exhibit these
""scooped out"" features but in a vertical
and almost uniform manner, extending from the sides
of the stone down to the ground, where they form straight lines. One of the most fascinating aspects can be observed
at the base of another stone near the unfinished obelisk. This particular stone is almost
completely scooped out at the base, leaving just a small portion
of granite connected to its original location. The peculiar appearance
of these features, unique and not seen
in other Egyptian structures, poses a challenge
to modern archaeology. But how does modern archeology
explain these scoop marks? The traditional narrative
suggests that the obelisk, believed
to have been commissioned during the time of Hatshepsut, was carved using diorite balls, which the ancient Egyptian workers
are believed to have pounded against the obelisk to shape it. This theory sounds ridiculous, considering the test holes
that are perfectly smooth, the perfectly flat walls, and the scoop marks
that are all the same size. Even if we consider that it's possible
to shape the granite block simply by pounding it
with a diorite stone, there are areas with limited space
around the obelisk that simply can't allow
a worker to carry out such a vigorous pounding action effectively enough
to produce noticeable results. The same goes for the test holes, with some of them
being extremely narrow, clearly offering insufficient space
for any pounding movements. Moreover, this ridiculous theory
still doesn't explain how the Egyptians planned to have
transported this colossal structure had it been completed. The obelisk is situated in a deep pit, and its extraction and transportation
to its intended destination would have been an engineering feat
of monumental proportions. Perhaps the unfinished obelisk
was left here by a civilization that predated the dynastic Egyptians, a civilization that had the technology to manipulate the granite
in such a way and be able to actually transport it
to its designated place once it's finished. The Dendera Light. The Dendera Light
is a fascinating topic steeped in mystery and intrigue, centering on the bas-reliefs
in the Hathor Temple at Dendera. These reliefs have sparked
widespread speculation and debate about the possibility
of ancient Egyptians having knowledge of electricity. The reliefs in question depict
what some interpret as large elongated objects
reminiscent of light bulbs. Priests hold these objects aloft, with more miniature figures
below them directing the light bulb upwards. Inside them are snake-like forms, which some suggest
represent filaments. A two-armed Djed pillar
is also present. We already talked about
the Djed pillar and how it resembles
components of electrical systems or devices used
for energy transmission. On another bas-relief,
a peculiar device is depicted featuring lines extending
from the object on the left side. Often likened to a necklace, it also bears resemblance
to a stylized technological device. Should the interpretation of these
lines as electrical wires hold true, then the spheres
might actually represent insulators. This object appears to be
connected to a type of battery, which in turn is linked
to what seems to be a distribution mechanism. This setup echoes
the circuitry designs found in vintage automobiles, particularly
in petrol combustion engines due to its simplicity and efficacy in facilitating
continuous electric discharge. The hypothesis that these reliefs depict an ancient form
of electrical lighting was popularized by
Norwegian electrical engineer and Austrian authors Peter Krassa and Rainer Habeck. They published a book titled ""Light of the Pharaohs: High Technology and Electricity
in Ancient Egypt"". Walter Garn,
another electrical engineer, even constructed a working model
based on the Dendera light, supporting the theory. Many connect
the Dendera light reliefs with the mysterious
Baghdad batteries, a discovery
that further fuels the debate about ancient civilizations and their potential knowledge
of electricity. The Baghdad batteries,
also known as the Parthian batteries, are a set of terracotta pots dating back to the Parthian
or Sassanian periods. Each pot contained
a copper cylinder that encased an iron rod, with the cylinder and rod
not touching each other. Filled with an acidic
or alkaline substance, such as vinegar or lemon juice, these pots could have functioned
as galvanic cells, essentially early forms of batteries. Many researchers built prototypes
of the Baghdad batteries, testing them for electricity, and stunningly, they discovered that the batteries
produce low voltages of electricity, proving that the ancients did, in fact, have knowledge
of this phenomenon. Secret Entrances of the Sphinx. The Great Sphinx of Giza, standing an impressive 66 feet high
and stretching 240 feet long, is a monument that captures
the world's imagination like few others. Constructed from
massive limestone blocks, some weighing up to 200 tons, it holds the title of the largest
ancient sculpture in the world. Yet, its grandeur is matched
only by its mystery. To this day, the Sphinx's origins, purpose,
and the secrets it may conceal remain a source of debate among historians
and archaeologists. The Giza Plateau
was known as Rostau or 'the mouth of passages'
in ancient times. Does that mean that there really
were passages beneath the complex? Passages leading to
an underground city containing advanced technology? In the 5th century BCE, the famed Greek historian
Herodotus wrote about an extensive
underground labyrinth in Egypt, which housed
a legendary Hall of Records containing ancient wisdom. Further accounts
by notable historical figures like Strabo and Pliny the Elder in the first century
supported these claims, describing an elaborate
underground maze associated with the Sphinx
and the pyramids. In the 4th century,
Syrian philosopher Iamblichus wrote about a tunnel system
beneath Giza, accessed through the Sphinx itself. According to his accounts, this entrance was once guarded
by a bronze gate and led to the Great Pyramid. In 1935, a significant discovery
was made by Hamilton M. Wright and his team. During a massive
clearing project in Giza, they uncovered
what appeared to be a vast, ancient subway system beneath
the Sphinx and the surrounding area. This system included a series of
shafts plunging over 125 feet deep, with expansive courts
and side chambers. These findings
suggested the existence of an underground city
beneath the Giza Plateau, a hypothesis
that sparked global interest. However,
as quickly as they came to light, these stories receded
from public attention, leading to speculations
about the nature and implications
of these discoveries. Why was such
a groundbreaking discovery seemingly dismissed? The idea of a hidden underground
network beneath the Sphinx was reignited in the early 1990s, when a team led by
Egyptologist John Anthony West and geologist Robert Schoch conducted seismic surveys
around the Sphinx. Their studies revealed
unexplained tunnels and chambers beneath the structure, suggesting
that the ancient descriptions could have been
more than mere legends. - We were not looking for structures
under the Sphinx. I was actually looking for
subsurface mineralogical changes, but we found some structures. Most importantly, we found
a chamber under the left paw. - These findings were both
groundbreaking and controversial, proposing a complex
subterranean world waiting to be explored. However, this wasn't
the only staggering discovery made by John Anthony West
and Robert Schoch. They examined
the erosion patterns on the Sphinx and its surrounding enclosure walls, suggesting they were caused
by the flow of water caused by heavy rains. But how was this possible, considering the Giza Plateau
is located in a desert? The climate of the Giza Plateau has been predominantly arid
for the last 5,000 years, meaning that such water erosion
would have had to occur during a time when the climate
was much wetter in the region. This pushes the possible
construction of the Sphinx back to a period
before the Sahara became a desert, potentially as early
as 7000 to 9000 BC, or even earlier. - Either this was
a weird geological anomaly or the Sphinx might go back
to an earlier period. What we had ending the last ice age
was huge climatic changes which put a lot
of moisture into the air which came down as precipitation
with huge thunderstorms, et cetera, and I think a lot of the erosion that we still see
on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure go back to that period. - The proof that the Sphinx
precedes dynastic Egypt by many thousands of years means there was,
at some distant past, sophisticated civilizations. - We cannot sensibly accept
the insistence of Egyptologists that the Sphinx is just
four-and-a-half thousand years old. - The implications of this theory
are profound, as it suggests that the Sphinx is several millennia older
than the commonly accepted date. The traditional historical belief
is that the Sphinx was built by the ancient Egyptians
of the Old Kingdom during the reign of
the Pharaoh Khafre around 2500 BC. For this reason, the theories of Schoch and West were met with
skepticism and opposition, primarily from Dr. Zahi Hawass, the former Minister of State
for Antiquities Affairs in Egypt. Hawass limited access to the Sphinx
for further research and study, making it challenging
for Schoch and West to advance their theories or conduct
more comprehensive investigations. Supporting Schoch's assertions, archeologist Sherif El-Morsi, with over two decades of experience
working on the Giza Plateau, proposes that the area was once
submerged under a massive flood. El-Morsi points to
the temple site of Menkare, which he believes
was a former lagoon when sea levels
were significantly higher, covering the Necropolis, the Sphinx, and the surrounding
temples and monuments. The evidence, as El-Morsi outlined, includes indications of tidal waves
and an intertidal zone, suggesting that the Giza Plateau
experienced significant flooding, peaking at about 75 meters
above the current sea level. Moreover,
the discovery of a fossilized echinoid within the limestone
used to construct these monuments has fueled the debate. Some researchers argue
that the echinoid is evidence of the limestone's
ancient origins, dating back 30 million years. However, El-Morsi counters this by suggesting that the echinoid
was petrified in a more recent epic, highlighting
its near-perfect condition and gravitational position
on the floor within the intertidal range
of the hypothesized lagoon. Adding to the controversy, two Ukrainian scientists,
Manichev and Parkhomenko, presented a study
at the International Conference of Geoarchaeology and
Archaeomineralogy in Sofia, positing that the Great Sphinx might be hundreds
of thousands of years old. They cite clear indications
of water erosion, and base their hypothesis
on geological studies of the Giza Plateau, asserting that the Sphinx had to
have been submerged underwater for an extended period. The idea that the pyramids
and the Sphinx could be remnants of a pre-flood civilization is not only confined
to academic circles. The concept of a great flood, akin to the biblical story of Noah, is a recurring theme in numerous
ancient texts in cultures worldwide. Renowned underwater archeologist Robert Ballard's
exploration in the Black Sea lends credence to the hypothesis of a catastrophic flood
occurring around 5000 BC, aligning with some
interpretations of Noah's flood. This global deluge narrative
is shared across diverse cultures, from India to ancient Greece
and North American Indian tribes, suggesting a collective memory of a significant and worldwide
cataclysmic event. The implications
of these theories are profound, suggesting that
the history of human civilization might be far older and more complex
than currently understood. If the Sphinx and the pyramids
were indeed constructed by a civilization that predates
traditional Egyptian history, it would not only revolutionize
our understanding of human history but also provide evidence
of advanced technologies and societal structures, existing in a time
before what is commonly accepted. Granite Boxes. We already mentioned the massive
granite boxes of the Saqqara, but we are obliged
to mention the many other fascinating and massive
granite boxes found in Egypt. Each one of them exhibits details suggesting the use of some form
of lost ancient technology far beyond what has traditionally
been understood or accepted. Take a look at this giant granite box
displayed at the Cairo Museum. This box,
significant yet not widely known, is believed to have been
abandoned by the Egyptians due to a mistake
in the cutting process. The irregular, slanted cut, deemed an error, led to the abandonment
of this particular stone block. However, this apparent 'mistake' inadvertently provides
strong evidence of a sophisticated
advanced tooling method, far surpassing the capabilities
attributed to the ancient Egyptians. The cut extends deep
into the hard granite, making it impossible
to fit a chisel inside. The conventional theory, widely espoused
by modern researchers, is that the ancient Egyptians used slow, primitive copper-based saws
for cutting granite. Yet, this theory falls short
when scrutinized. Trials replicating this method demonstrated
an excruciatingly slow cutting rate of only four millimeters,
or 0.15 inches an hour. At such a slow pace, it is highly implausible
that the artisans would not have noticed
and corrected a deviation as significant as the one
seen in the granite box. Where the cut
should have continued, the stone has been marked
with a groove. Even this mark
is precise and smooth. Moreover, it appears the granite was cut
from two sides simultaneously, most likely by two circular saws, with one cutting from above
and one cutting from below. To see such a smooth
and perfectly precise stonecutting, we have to assume
that they were using some sort of
sophisticated machine capable of
rapidly cutting through granite. We can also see precise saw marks in another granite box
in the Cairo Museum, which is just a few steps away. The marks we see here look like the marks
left by a type of saw strikingly similar
to a modern band saw but with capabilities suggesting
a much higher speed of operation. In contemporary terms, such an advanced
cutting mechanism requires the use of diamonds, specifically
a diamond-encrusted blade, to slice through granite efficiently. The existence
of such advanced tooling presents a historical anomaly. During the dynastic times
of ancient Egypt, there is no recorded evidence
of diamond technology or tools with diamond encrustations
being used or even existing. Another strange box-like artifact
is this one. On top of it, there are a series of circles
that are perfectly smooth, most likely made
with some sort of machine, as they are completely identical. On the side of the object, there are strange burn marks that left significant damage
to the stone. The head of whatever
caused these marks must have been immense. The exact purpose of this artifact
is still unknown. This box, made from red granite,
has even more spectacular marks. Not only is it perfectly hollowed out and shaped
with precise right angles, but it also has
these strange tube drill holes. These drill holes
are exactly the same size, penetrating the granite
at an intense depth. It's almost undeniable
that these marks were made with an advanced machine
rather than simple bronze tools. And if this isn't enough
to convince you, take a look at this granite artifact, which also exhibits
tube drilling techniques. If you look closer, you can even see
the spiral grooves on the piece. These grooves display
uniform depth and spacing, and are evident
in all the drilled holes of the artifact. Given that the holes intersect, the consistency of these grooves
would be unlikely if they were the result
of an abrasive slurry. Core 7 is a remarkable
cylindrical piece of granite discovered near the Great Pyramids
that is at least 4,500-year-old. This ancient artifact is notable
for its perfectly spaced, continuous spiral groove, reminiscent
of a vinyl record's grooves. Such precision
suggests a level of technology seemingly beyond the capabilities
of ancient Egyptian civilization, known to possess
only soft copper tools, inadequate for drilling
into hard granite. The mystery deepens when
considering the nature of the groove. Traditional Egyptian tools,
like the bow drill, produced a distinct
back-and-forth pattern, unlike the single, continuous spiral
found on Core 7. This pattern is more akin
to the marks left by modern, rapidly rotating drills, suggesting a drilling method
far advanced for its time. Modern machinery capable
of creating a similar core operates at high speeds
and often employs diamond tips, a material hard enough
to penetrate granite. This raises the provocative question
of whether ancient Egyptians might have had access to such
advanced drilling techniques, potentially involving materials
as hard as diamond. The groove's shape on Core 7
not only defies the expected capabilities
of ancient Egyptian technology but also implies a drilling force greater than that
of contemporary power drills. Analysis of the spacing
between each spiral turn indicates a drilling pressure
that surpasses modern equipment, hinting at an unknown, highly advanced
civilization or technology. - The core was made
by a drilling process with greater strength
than a modern power drill. What does this tell us? There are no tools of that caliber
that we know of. - If you were impressed by the
granite boxes we showed you so far, you will be stunned
by the ones on Elephantine Island. This site is like a graveyard
of advanced technology, as it's filled with scattered remains of extremely precise
granite artifacts, cut and shaped to perfection. The only structure that was left
in relatively good shape is this massive box,
which Egyptologists call a shrine. It features a pointed
or pyramid-like top, sharply defined, possibly once housing
a Benben-like stone or point similar to
the Old Kingdom pyramids. Additionally, the box
is not completely hollowed out but includes inset edges
and a large step or platform inside. The box's interior showcases
precise 90-degree corners with tiny inside radii. Around the inset edge, we can find large tube drill holes, which were probably pivot points
for some sort of mechanism. The smooth, flat surfaces, sharp corners, and intricate details
suggest a level of accuracy that these primitive tools
could not achieve. Further examination of the box
reveals a semicircular edging running around the top and bottom. This edging, seemingly carved
from a single piece of granite, is evidently the result
of a now-lost technology. What's more shocking is that this granite altar,
as they call it, is not a unique creation. The entire site is filled
with the broken remains of dozens of such altars, all showcasing the exact same
features and precise carvings. It's like the entire site
was a modern factory that manufactured
these artifacts in large quantities until something happened
that destroyed the entire site. And all of these granite boxes
and artifacts we showed you are just the beginning. There are countless more, all of which possess
features and qualities resulting from advanced machinery. Perhaps the most precise
granite box found anywhere in the world is the one discovered
beneath the pyramid at Lahun. There, inside a chamber made of
polished curved granite stones, we find this remarkable
tilted granite box that is perfectly flat
along the top side. When researchers measured
the four corners of the box with modern equipment, they were stunned to find
that they are near-identical. A similarly startling mystery
can be found at Mastaba 17, a monument located near Meidum. Beneath
a crumbling pile of mudbricks lies an enormous
megalithic stone chamber containing a precision-cut stone box, precisely fashioned
with perfect corners inside and out from a single piece of granite. The lid has rising rectangular edges,
and there are knobs on the ends. Is it possible that all of these
granite boxes and artifacts were the leftovers
of a lost prehistoric civilization that flourished before the Egyptians? Perhaps this will explain
why such sophisticated objects were used for such
primitive purposes as sarcophagi, because the Egyptians
who found them didn't know their real purpose, just like us today. Abu Rawash Staircase. On the desert floor of Abu Rawash, near the remnants of Djedefre's
now-destroyed pyramid, there's a mysterious staircase
going deep underground. This site, brought to public attention
by researcher Antoine Gigal and subsequently
popularized by others, presents an intriguing glimpse
into ancient engineering and the vast, unexplored
underground network of Egypt. Gigal, during her exploration, observed the staircase's
unique features: the deep narrow cut
into the limestone bedrock, its vertical walls,
the regular steps, and the remarkable depth it reached, culminating in a pool
of dark, muddy water. Contrary to the local guide's
identification of the structure as a Roman well, Gigal harbored doubts, given its dissimilarity to Roman wells
she had encountered in Italy, Spain, and Egypt. Her speculation
leaned towards it being an entrance to an underground network
of tunnels, possibly leading to a structure
akin to a serapeum. Its precise, vertical walls
and regular steps are reminiscent of the descending
corridor into the Great Pyramid, suggesting
a sophistication in construction that far surpassed
that of the Romans or even the dynastic Egyptians. Adding to the mystery, Gigal noted the staircase's alignment
with the sacred city of Sais, hinting at a significance
beyond a mere well. Despite its apparent ancient origins, the staircase's purpose and the era
in which it was constructed remain shrouded in mystery. No serious excavation effort
has been made to unravel the secrets of this site. Gigal's exploration provided
a visual feast of the structure from various angles, showcasing its depth
and the precision of its construction. However, the lack of commentary
or substantial information has left many questions unanswered. Currently, the staircase falls
into a forbidden area and is restricted
to military personnel only. The Melted Stairs. While we're still
on the topic of stairs, we can return
to the Hathor Temple at Dendera, where we examined
the Light Bulb carvings earlier. At one section of the temple, we can see these stairs
that appear to be melted, giving them an almost surreal look
against the backdrop of meticulously carved hieroglyphs
and imposing columns. The stairs, with their surfaces
seemingly softened and flowing like wax
under intense heat, have led to many theories
regarding the nature and cause of this peculiar phenomenon. Some suggest
that the melting of the stairs is the result of a deliberate act, perhaps utilizing a technology
or method of construction that is lost to us today. This theory leans on the assumption that the ancients had access
to knowledge or technology that could apply
such intense heat to stone, reshaping it without destroying
the surrounding structures. Among the more
intriguing hypotheses is the idea that the stairs
were intentionally altered using a form
of ancient chemical manipulation. This would involve applying
a substance that softened the stone, allowing it to be molded or reshaped
before hardening once again. Such a technique would suggest
the ancient Egyptians had a revolutionary insight
into chemistry. Skeptics and proponents
of more conventional explanations argue that the 'melting'
is not melting at all, but a deformation resulting from
wear and tear from centuries of use, combined with erosion
from environmental factors. The steps, being part of a pathway
for countless pilgrims, priests, and visitors over the ages, could have simply been worn down
in a manner that, to the modern observer, appears as if the stone had melted. Despite these various theories, no single explanation
has universally satisfied the curious and scholarly alike. Abu Ghurab. Abu Ghurab is a site
often overlooked in the shadow
of the majestic Giza Plateau and serves as a crucial piece
in examining the clues left by the use
of advanced ancient technology. Central to the allure of this site
are the meticulously crafted bowls, whose origins and purposes
spark much debate and fascination. According to
mainstream Egyptologists, the massive basins were used
to hold sacrificial animal blood, which ran through the round
channels cut into the paving. Yet, there is not a single drop of DNA or other evidence
to support this theory. Moreover, the placement
of the holes near the top rather than at the bottom
also makes this theory implausible. The bowls are hewn
from large blocks of travertine, and their creation evidently involved
the use of ancient high technology and some form of machining. The precise nature of these holes, upon closer inspection, reveals an oval shape
rather than a perfect circle, suggesting the use of
a specialized drilling technique unknown to modern archaeology. The finish on these artifacts ranges from
exceptionally smooth surfaces to sharply angled edges, presenting a stark contrast
to the rougher textures found on other parts
of the same pieces. On some parts
of the perfectly smooth surfaces, we can find
additional machining marks. Further intriguing is the suggestion
that the shape of these bowls bears a resemblance
to components used in modern
sonic levitation technology. A proponent of this theory
is researcher Alex Putney, who has extensively explored
the potential of resonant frequencies and their application
in ancient technologies. According to Putney and others
who support this viewpoint, the peculiar shapes
and precise craftsmanship of the bowls
discovered at Abu Ghurab might not have been merely for
ceremonial or decorative purposes. Instead, they suggest these artifacts
were part of a complex system designed to harness
acoustic energy. The theory hinges on
the idea that these bowls, when struck or otherwise
acoustically activated, could generate specific frequencies conducive to levitating objects
or influencing matter in a manner currently understood only in the context
of advanced physics. But the bowls are not the only
out-of-place artifacts at the site. There is this massive
granite column fragment showing signs of color. There is this one
that has various holes and cuts. There are also strange stones
which, when hit from the top, generate resonating tones. And of course,
there are various tube drill holes. Some of them are extremely precise
with evident groove marks. There are also stones
with marks from what appears to be a large circular saw. What's even strange about this place is that there are seashells
in some parts, making you wonder
how old this place really is. Here we can also find
a massive multi-block structure known as the Hotep. According to geologists, the five massive blocks
composing the Hotep likely originated from a quarry
far beyond Egypt's borders, possibly in Turkey. The construction techniques
evident in the Hotep further contribute to its intrigue. The use of tube drills
is clearly visible in the structure, with striations and overcuts
marking the corners of the stone. Parts of the structure
are also perfectly smooth, evidently polished
with advanced methods. The massive capstone at the center
has circular saw marks which are impossible to make
with primitive tools. Mainstream Egyptology
identifies this artifact as an altar, aligning with the site's classification
not as a tomb but as a Sun temple. However, some believe
that below the capstone, there's a shaft that connects
to a subterranean passage leading to Giza. In fact,
from the summit of Abu Ghurab, one can observe circular formations
beneath the sand from afar. These indentations,
which have been present for ages, have led numerous observers
to speculate about the existence of significant
buried structures there. Judging by all the destroyed
and scattered granite blocks and structures at the site, it's evident that this place
was destroyed by a massive cataclysmic force that left this place
in the state we see it today. It is still unknown
what this force was or what the true purpose
of the structures was, but judging by
the intricately carved stones, we can undoubtedly conclude they were part of a much more
sophisticated network – a highly advanced complex, left from an unknown civilization. The Abydos Hieroglyphs. In the Temple of Seti I in Abydos, an extraordinary discovery
has stirred a significant debate within the scientific community. It was during an examination
by Egyptologist Dr. Ruth Hover that a particularly startling find
came to light. In the temple at Abydos, she photographed
a wall panel in a section where an overlaying panel
with Egyptian hieroglyphics crumbled and fell, revealing an older panel beneath it. This older panel
contains figures that suggest representations
of advanced technology mirroring that of the modern era. At the bottom appears to be
a depiction of an aircraft with a clearly defined rudder. At the top is a shape clearly identified
as a modern-day helicopter. To the right of this
is a streamlined water vessel, below which
is what appears to be a submarine. These representations
have sparked intense discussions among scholars and researchers. - And incised in the stone itself
of this oldest temple along the Nile, I think the images
are of ancient technology that we now have. - Critics of
the advanced technology theory argue that the helicopter
and other vehicle-like images are the result of erosions, over-carvings, and the superimposition
of hieroglyphs over time. According to this view, what appears to be
modern technology is actually a palimpsest, an occurrence
in Egyptian hieroglyphics where older inscriptions
were overwritten by newer ones due to the limited space
on temple walls. However, many are not satisfied
with this explanation, as the similarities are too striking, with not one, but three depictions
of advanced vehicles. The debate over these findings
is far from settled. Skeptics argue for more grounded
interpretations of ancient symbols, while proponents
of Dr. Hover's theories see them as evidence
of a civilization far more advanced
than previously believed. Machine Manufactured Artifacts. The lathe-manufactured
Egyptian artifacts housed in the Cairo Museum
and other institutions worldwide bear witness to incredible precision and the unmistakable marks
of lathe use. These artifacts, primarily consisting
of bowls, vases, and plates, were unearthed
near the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, with additional pieces found at Giza. They are believed to be
extremely old, possible predating
the earliest periods of ancient Egyptian civilization. At the same time, however, they are the finest
and most well-manufactured items ever discovered. According to
mainstream Egyptologists, these granite artifacts were made
with the use of primitive tools. Yet, many believe that the clean, narrow, and perfectly circular lines
found on the objects are evidence of the use
of lathe technology. The intricacy and precision
of these artifacts, such as vases made
from brittle stone like schist and finished to a paper-thin edge, or bowls so perfectly balanced they can rest on a point
no larger than a hen's egg, all suggest the use
of advanced technology. Interestingly, artifacts of this sophistication
were not found beyond the earliest periods
of Egyptian civilization, indicating a loss of this
specialized knowledge over time. The presence of crude inscriptions
on some items, likely added long after their creation, suggests these artifacts
were valued and perhaps repurposed
throughout Egyptian history. The concentration of these items
around the Step Pyramid, Egypt's oldest stone pyramid, raises fascinating questions
about their use and significance. The craftsmanship
displayed in these vases, particularly
in their thinness and precision, raises questions
about the techniques and tools used in their creation. For example, a vase examined by Flinders Petrie, a pioneering Egyptologist known for
applying engineering principles to archaeological findings, was found to have a wall thickness
of merely 1/40th of an inch. The collection of over 50,000 vases
beneath the Step Pyramid, documented by Petrie, highlights the significance
of these objects in ancient Egyptian society, who likely inherited these artifacts
from a much older civilization. Recent advancements in analysis
and scanning technologies have allowed for
a closer examination of these vases, with scans revealing
astounding levels of precision. The YouTube channel UnchartedX has been part of a research
on these objects that scanned them
via structured light and CT-Xray, and the results they unveiled
were shocking. This technology, typically used
in aerospace industries, has mapped the vase's structure
with incredible accuracy, showcasing the precision
with which these vases were made, revealing that
the flatness of the vase's lip was within three-thousandths
of an inch of being perfectly flat, a level of precision
that is difficult to achieve even with modern technology. Moreover, the cylindrical shape
of the vase's mouth was found to be
perfectly perpendicular to its top within one-thousandth of an inch, and its circularity was within thirteen-thousandths
of an inch of perfection. Such precision, achieved on a vase that is
at least five thousand years old – and potentially much older – is simply staggering. The notion that these vases
could have been made by hand, using primitive tools, is becoming increasingly untenable
in the face of such evidence. The precision and symmetry
observed in these artifacts suggest the use
of machinery or advanced tools that have yet to be
discovered or understood. The Giza Complex. The Great Pyramid of Giza, an architectural
and engineering masterpiece, remains one of the most remarkable
achievements in human history, embodying a level
of precision and sophistication that still baffles
researchers and scholars today. This monument
holds within its stones secrets and traces
of advanced technology that we are only beginning
to understand. Just when you
approach the pyramid, you can start seeing these traces
of advanced technology. For example,
there are many basalt stone blocks with vertical machine marks
on them. The presence of vertical lines
meticulously carved into basalt – a material not native
to the pyramid's vicinity – raises immediate questions
about the tools and methods employed by the ancients. These lines,
distinct from mere scratches, display a pattern
indicative of saw marks, suggesting the use
of advanced machining technology far beyond the capabilities
of bronze chisels or saws, even when aided by
abrasive materials like silica sand. Further scrutiny of the area
uncovers additional examples that hint at the utilization of older, yet highly advanced
machining techniques. For instance, remnants of saw cuts with diameters approximating
1/8 to 1/4 of an inch reveal not only the precision but also the possibility
of curved cuts, potentially pointing towards
the use of giant circular saws. This evidence contradicts
the traditional narrative that attributes
the pyramid's construction to simple tools and manual labor. In front of the second pyramid, we can find many remnants
of molten granite within channels extending from the pyramid
towards the Sphinx. A particularly striking discovery
is a limestone block with a channel of molten granite
running through it, showcasing a vivid array of colors and hinting at the intense heat
it must have endured. This, along with areas
of charred granite and limestone, raises intriguing questions
about the processes and events that led to these conditions. Observations of the original
external casing stones further complicate the story. The extremely tight fit
between these stones suggests a level
of craftsmanship and precision that is difficult to reconcile
with the tools supposedly available during the pyramid's construction. The Great Pyramid
and its two smaller pyramids are placed in the exact same manner as the three stars
that make up 'Orion's belt'. The last time the pyramids
aligned with Orion's belt was about 10,450 years ago. This strongly suggests the pyramids
are at least 10,000 years old and are probably much older. Perhaps that would explain why
there's no mention of the pyramids or their creation
in any of the Egyptian writings. Such evidence challenges
the established chronology of Egyptian history and suggests
that the Great Pyramid, and possibly its neighbors, might have pre-existed
the dynastic Egyptian civilization. Most people think
that the pyramids of Giza are just these three large pyramids; however, the complex is filled
with numerous smaller structures including many small pyramids that
still bear their original casing stones. There are also numerous
shafts and tunnels, like the Osiris Shaft, which hint at the notion that there's
a massive subterranean complex below the Giza Plateau. Situated at 115 feet
or 35 meters below the surface, the Osiris Shaft leads to what is
referred to as the ""Tomb of Osiris"". It features a granite sarcophagus
at the center of a chamber, surrounded by an artificial canal
filled with water. The question that naturally arises is, how did they ensure a reliable
water source to fill this canal? And moreover, how did they manage to maintain
the water at precisely the right level? The only plausible explanation
for this feat is the existence of an advanced
underground hydrological system of chambers and tunnels
in the vicinity, specifically designed
to harness and direct water from a natural spring into the shaft. The solid bedrock in the area rules out the chance
of random leaks, further supporting the theory
that the water is supplied via a deliberately constructed
concealed channel. The implications
of such a channel are profound, indicating a monumental
subterranean engineering project unparalleled in its time. The true purpose of this
subterranean structure is a mystery, and there aren't any ladders
or any other method to even go down there. So how did they manage to place
massive granite sarcophagi weighing up to 40 tons each
inside the structure? Furthermore, the decision to bring these
massive granite boxes underground instead of carving them
directly into the bedrock meant a specific purpose
was attached to these objects or the material they were made of. There was one sarcophagus
that was not made of granite though. It was made from dacite, a material that was not used
for any other known object in ancient Egypt's history. Not only that, this material cannot be found
anywhere in Africa. This means
that whoever built the shaft transported the massive
40-ton dacite sarcophagus over vast distances, possibly from
across the Mediterranean. The application
of advanced dating techniques has revealed that the shaft is
most likely at least 5,000 years old, pushing back the timeline of this site
to pre-dynastic periods. But let's get back
to the Great Pyramid of Giza. According to measurements,
the Great Pyramid is the most accurately aligned
structure in existence and faces true north
with only 3/60th of a degree of error. The position of the North Pole
moves over time and the pyramid
was exactly aligned at one time. Even more incredibly, the Great Pyramid is located at the center
of the land mass of the Earth. The east/west parallel
that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian
that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the Earth, one in the ocean
and the other at the Great Pyramid. This alignment was achieved
without the compass, which would not be invented
for thousands of years. Such precision suggests a profound
understanding of astronomy and possibly the use
of star sightings or other advanced methods
to determine cardinal directions with astounding accuracy. The builders of the pyramids had such detailed knowledge
of the solstices and equinoxes that on the day of the spring equinox, the sun shines
directly over the Great Pyramid, and in those few moments,
the pyramid does not cast a shadow. Another interesting feature is the acoustic qualities
within the pyramid, particularly within
the King's Chamber. The chamber is constructed
from huge blocks of granite, a material known for its density
and sound-reflecting abilities. When vocalizations or sounds
are made within this chamber, they resonate, creating a powerful
and reverberating acoustic effect. This resonance
doesn't merely amplify sound; it seems to enhance it, giving it a quality that is both
profound and enduring. Listen to these
acoustic demonstrations from Brian Foerster's video in which he examines
the King's Chamber together with Yousef Awyan,
an expert of acoustic resonance. The sound can linger in the air
far longer than one would expect, leading researchers to propose
that the pyramid's architects might have
intentionally incorporated these acoustic features. The specific
dimensions and materials chosen for the King's Chamber, and possibly other parts
of the pyramid, could have been
meticulously selected to achieve
a particular resonance frequency. This suggests a level
of knowledge and intentionality in the use of sound
that is quite advanced, indicating the practical significance
of acoustics in the pyramid's design. One of the most astounding theories
of all emerged in the 1960s, thanks to a man
named Edward Kunkel. In 1962, Kunkel published a book
entitled Pharaoh's Pump, which shook up
the world of Egyptology. In it, he argued that
the passages and chambers in and beneath the Great Pyramid were the conduits and reservoirs
of a giant water pump that would have been used
to send water out into the desert to irrigate the land. According to Kunkel, the pyramid
actually contained two pumps – one underground, represented by the pyramid's
mysterious subterranean chamber, and the other above ground
in the middle and upper chambers. Together, they would create two streams
that would exit the pyramid through shafts
on the north and south sides. Unsurprisingly, Kunkel's work
caused great skepticism, not only from Egyptologists,
who rejected the theory outright, but from engineers, who pointed out that Kunkel's design
would have required ""the creation of a vacuum, a number of valves, and some type of combustible fuel
and combustion chamber to drive the pump."" Yet, not bound
by the same restrictions as mainstream Egyptology, many engineers began
to look closer at Kunkel's work, realizing that it was
not totally without merit. While Kunkel's two-pump design
would likely not have been possible, some engineers noted that a ram pump
might actually make sense. A ram pump is a simple device
used for centuries to move water from a reservoir to somewhere else using two moving parts
and the force of gravity. Could the builders
of the Great Pyramid really have created a ram pump
on such a massive scale? With the possibility established, other researchers and scholars
picked up on the idea, designing a theoretical layout
in which the Great Pyramid was fed with water from the Western Nile
and nearby Lake Moeris, which each sat at a higher elevation, making them the perfect sources
for a gravity-fed water system on the Giza Plateau. Some even believed
that the retaining wall, which is known to have once
surrounded the pyramid complex, could have been an embankment
for an onsite reservoir. As more and more people came
to believe that the Great Pyramid really could have been
an enormous ancient water pump, they were backed by one
simple overarching argument – economics. Think about it. The Great Pyramid
is made up of 2.3 million blocks each weighing
between 25 and 80 tons, meaning that if workers moved
and laid 12 blocks per hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it would have taken
20 years to construct. More than that,
it has been estimated that, adjusted into modern dollar values, the pyramid would have cost
more than $5 billion to create. Simply, why go to all this trouble
and all this expense just for a tomb? Obviously, Egyptian pharaohs had more leeway than modern,
democratically elected leaders, but they were not totally unbound from the realities
of finance and economics. Would it not make more sense
to go to all this trouble for something
which was going to provide a higher return
on investment, like, say, a water pump which would allow you to irrigate your civilization
and feed your people? Here, we must take a step back
in order to get to the point. If the Great Pyramid really was
an enormous water pump, then it must have been pumping
the water somewhere. This is where some
have connected the dots and returned to the mysterious pit
at Zawyet El Aryan. They believe that the site
was not an unfinished pyramid, but an outflow location for water
pumped by the Great Pyramid, the giant pit designed as a reservoir
for water pumped in from below. It might actually go much further
than pumping water for irrigation. Early in 1999, a marine engineer
named John Cadman was perusing the shelves
at a used bookstore when he stumbled across
an old, dusty copy of a most unusual book, Pharaoh's Pump. As an expert in hydraulics,
the book intrigued Cadman, so he purchased it and took it home. When he began
to read it more closely, he quickly realized that Kunkel's idea was not as ridiculous
as he had initially assumed. Wanting to know more, Cadman began to learn everything
he could about the Great Pyramid. Almost immediately, what he discovered
captivated him – the Great Pyramid's
subterranean chamber, he realized, looked eerily like the layout
for a ram pump. He took his research further, noting from photographs
that the subterranean chamber showed obvious signs
of water damage, particularly on the ceiling, where signs of cavitation, which is caused by gas bubbles
in water due to violent churning, were evident,
as well as clear damage from compression waves striking it. In other words, it was not just
that the subterranean chamber could work as a water pump, but, according to
Cadman's trained eyes, it appeared it had worked as such. At this point, Cadman knew what he had to do – he must draw upon his years
of experience with hydraulics and create his own
scale model of the pyramid and its subterranean chamber to see if it would really work
as a water pump. He built his first model, using a nearby river as a reservoir. Unfortunately,
the model did not work, first leaking, then cracking, and failing to pump water
as he had hoped. But Cadman
would not give up that easily. He built another model, then another, both of which
suffered the same fate as the first. But on his fourth try,
he got everything right, and much to Cadman's delight,
his pump worked. This proved to Cadman
beyond a doubt that the Great Pyramid could have
functioned as a giant water pump, and that surely,
this was not by accident. It was clear, he asserted,
that the creators of the Great Pyramid's
subterranean chamber had known
exactly what they were doing. This was the breakthrough that disciples of Edward Kunkel's
original work had been waiting for. the tangible proof
that a Great Pyramid water pump was more than just speculation. And yet,
as Cadman continued his research, the results
got even more mind blowing, and in fact, went far beyond
the mere pumping of water. Having proved that the Great Pyramid's
subterranean chamber could function as a water pump, Cadman built a new, bigger model and encased it in concrete
in order to simulate the effects of the pump operating underground. He moved the model,
which weighed over 500 pounds, to a seasonal creek
with a pond serving as a reservoir. As this model began to work, Cadman immediately noticed
something which shocked him. Encased in concrete, the pump was creating
a vertical compression wave, a recurring heartbeat-like thump which could be felt
through the ground 20 feet away, and heard more than 100 feet away. Cadman realized
that what he had constructed went far beyond just a water pump. Because of
the powerful waves it generated, Cadman renamed the device
a ""pulse generator."" Truly, this changed everything. If the Great Pyramid's
subterranean chamber was generating pulse waves, these waves would have moved
through the granite upper chambers and passageways of the pyramid, and due to granite's
reflective properties, created ionization
in the atmosphere, in effect, producing an electric field. Put more simply, the pulses created
by the subterranean pump would have interacted
with the pyramid's granite to produce electricity. It appeared that Cadman
had not only proven that the Great Pyramid
could function as a water pump to move water around Egypt
for irrigation, but one which could actually create
electricity in ancient times. Of course, those who have
watched this channel before will know that the idea
of the Great Pyramid as an electrical generator did not start with John Cadman. In fact, as early as the turn
of the 20th century, it appeared prominently
in the work of famed inventor Nikola Tesla. But while many of you will already
be aware of the work of Tesla, you may not be aware of his
""obsession"" with ancient Egypt, and specifically the pyramids,
which he studied in detail, wrote about,
and incorporated into his work. Consider, in 1905, Tesla filed a patent titled ""Art of transmitting electrical energy
through a natural medium,"" which contained the design
for something called ""Tesla's Electromagnetic Pyramid."" Supplementing his genius with what
he had learned about ancient Egypt, his idea was to use
a huge pyramid-like structure to project energy skyward
where it could then be harnessed by individual receptors
around the world. Interestingly, Tesla actually built a model
of his electromagnetic pyramid known as Wardenclyffe Tower – a 187-foot-tall structure topped with a 55-ton dome
of conductive metal. Unfortunately, before he could conclusively prove
that his model could create energy, Tesla lost his funding, and the project was abandoned. And yet, even though Tesla's work
on electromagnetic pyramids disappeared, the idea did not. Thanks to Tesla, many began to look at
the Great Pyramid with fresh eyes, and specifically,
its original makeup – covered in
white tufa limestone blocks, which are known for
unparalleled insulating properties, its tunnels and chambers
beneath lined with granite, a well-known electrical conductor. Simply, this would have been
the perfect layout if the intent was to create
and utilize electricity, little granite channels
of electrical conductivity surrounded by insulation, not unlike copper wires
encased in rubber in modern electronic devices. Moreover, it is known
that the Great Pyramid was originally topped
by a capstone of gold, one of the most electrically
conductive materials on Earth, similar to how
Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower was topped with a 55-ton metal ball. In other words, if the Great Pyramid
was designed for electricity, its builders
couldn't have done it better, and if it wasn't, well,
in an historic coincidence, they'd accidentally stumbled
into the perfect design. To add to the mystery, in 1993, a mysterious and inaccessible room
was discovered after remaining hidden
for thousands of years. Appearing to have
deliberately been concealed by the structure's engineers, the room came to be called
the Queen's Chamber, and was finally explored in 2011 with a small remote camera
to reveal something very strange. It contained
carefully-crafted copper wire, and more importantly, there were instructions
painted as symbols onto the floor which appeared to show
a clear wiring diagram. You can run an electric current
through copper wire, and the coil will produce
a short-range magnetic field. Add a second coil, and the power's transferred
from one coil to the other. A windowless room
with copper wirings could create a higher potential
on one wall which transfers energy
to the lower potential, consequentially releasing
electromagnetic energy into the confined space
of the so-called Queen's Chamber. Indeed, so suggestive was the evidence
that the idea continued to develop into modern times. Christopher Dunn
is a mechanical engineer who has worked
for more than half a century at the highest levels
of aerospace manufacturing. In the 1970s, Dunn began to develop an interest in the mysteries
of the Great Pyramid of Giza. At the same time
as he worked his day job in the aerospace industry, he began spending his spare time
researching the Great Pyramid from a mechanical
engineering perspective. Slowly but surely, he came to the belief that there was
more to the pyramid than it seemed. In his words, ""I came to the conclusion that with
such an investment of resources and the extreme precision
which was crafted into the building, it was a building
that functioned as a machine and the machine was used
to harness energy from the earth. I was inspired to research and
discover how this machine operated."" For more than twenty years,
he conducted this research, becoming a prominent expert
on the subject, publishing dozens of articles and appearing as a trusted voice
across mainstream television. - They were attuned to vibrate
with the frequencies of the Earth, and they converted
the energies of the Earth into electromagnetic energy. - In 1998, one year before John Cadman's
legendary experiments which proved the electrical capacity
of the Great Pyramid, Dunn finally published
his seminal work. Titled ""The Giza Power Plant"", the book
meticulously described a system in which the Great Pyramid
drew seismic energy from the Earth, producing electricity
in the King's Chamber through the use of hydrogen created by a chemical reaction
in the Queen's chamber. So groundbreaking was Dunn's work that it inspired researchers
around the world to follow his lead. For more than two decades, research has
continued and expanded, becoming only more astonishing
every year. In fact, more than ever, science, and specifically
mainstream science, is taking the idea
of the Great Pyramid as an electrical generator
seriously. Indeed, in 2018, a study was published
in the prestigious Journal of Applied Physics which examined the Great Pyramid's
response to radio waves, and concluded
that the pyramid could in fact ""concentrate electromagnetic energy
in its internal chambers as well as under its base,"" seeming to confirm
the research of Cadman and the ideas of Tesla. Then, in 2019, a new book was published by Egyptologists James Brown
and J.J & Desiree Hurtak entitled ""Giza's Industrial Complex"", which built on the work of Dunn to suggest
that the entire Giza Plateau functioned as
an energy generating system. According to the authors, the structures around
and beneath the plateau were designed to activate
a sophisticated process of ""water splitting,"" which would allow hydrogen
to be used as a fuel source. As they put it in the book, ""There is good evidence
that the Great Pyramid was a gigantic
water processing plant to create electrified water."" It is indicative of how far the idea of the Great Pyramid
as an electrical generator has come that the book and the idea were not immediately
written off as ridiculous. In fact, instead of being mocked, the book actually won awards, including the prestigious
New York City Big Book Award. Again, now more than ever, mainstream science views
the possibility of the Great Pyramid as an electrical generator
as eminently possible. In pondering the grandeur
of Egypt's ancient structures and the sophisticated
technologies they imply, one compelling theory emerges – that these marvels
are not solely the achievements of the historically known
dynastic Egyptians but rather the remnants of a far more advanced
ancient civilization. This civilization,
predating recorded history, could have passed down
a wealth of knowledge and technological prowess, setting the foundation upon which
later Egyptians built and thrived. Such achievements prompt us
to consider the possibility that these were not
the initial experiments of an emerging civilization but rather the inherited legacy
of a predecessor, whose knowledge and achievements
were monumental enough to influence generations
long after their disappearance. This theory does not diminish the accomplishments
of the dynastic Egyptians but rather highlights a continuity
of human achievement and the potential for civilizations to build upon the legacies
left by their predecessors. It suggests that the ancient Egyptians were inheritors of a rich
and sophisticated legacy, which they adapted and preserved."

down meaning that Apple managed to release this as somehow one of the most affordable tablets and you can tell Steve Jobs fully knew that when he announced that the thing was not going to be $999 but in fact $499 listen to that reaction wow and two but the way you could interact with the thing was revolutionary like I said practically every tablet at the time had a stylus to mimic the mouse pointer since they were all just Windows computers and so when Steve Jobs announced that they managed to scale up the iPhone's capacitive multi-touch interface to work on their tablet and that all you needed was a finger I mean he probably could have just dropped the mic and walked off at that moment no more things this was such a New Concept that even though it seems so obvious now jobs actually needed to show people how to navigate this thing not to men this was the first time you could just rotate on iOS and switch over to landscape mode man using this thing takes me back so much I remember this being such a desirable Gadget and it's also a sign how much care they put into the user interface that it still holds up today I would actually go as far as to say that it is still beautiful and even though the thing is not light just by being light enough that you can hold it in one hand intuitive to use and Powerful with the Apple A4 chip making it 3.4 times more powerful than the first iPhone Apple very quickly put tablets back on people's Radars the iPad sold over 15 million units in total before it was replaced which considering the state of the tablet Market at the time makes this a breakout success leaving apple with no joke 85% of the tablet market and you know what I would actually go as far as to say that the iPad 2 just one year later was even more of a revelation cuz if the iPad 1 was an Apple tablet that nailed the fundamentals then the iPad 2 was a full modernization of those fundamentals all for that same $499 price for example it was thinner but I don't mean like phones today that might come out 0.2 mm thinner than the last one I mean Apple went from 13.4 mm all the way to 8.8 in large part by replacing the original iPads 2 fatter batteries with three flatter batteries which also allow them to remove some of the internal plastic support framing it was the first iPad with cameras a front 0.3 map and a back 0.7 map and apple celebrated that with the launch of photo booth on iOS which no one was using as their main camera but there was definitely something fun about the fusion of the camera with the iPad's fun bite-sized software oh my goodness me I remember this feeling like people's first taste at what you now get with the practically unlimited Snapchat filters to think there must have been a point where all of these Apple XX were sitting in a boardroom testing these features God iPad 2 had double the Ram at 512 MB and the new dual core A5 chip ended up making this about about 2.5 times faster than the original iPad so let me try and load up the same web page on both this was like the classic comparison everyone wanted to see at the time let's go samsung.com 3 2 1 go what Safari cannot open the page cuz it could not establish a secure connection to the server what are they trying to say about Samsung apple.com 3 2 1 go oh oh oh oh oh well the iPad 2 has already started to load the page iPad one is still going still going there you go although neither can actually load the full page [Music] not to mention this is where Apple introduced smart covers automatically putting the iPad in sleep mode when closed while cleaning the screen with their microfiber cloth backing this doesn't normally happen with SQL products but the iPad 2 was such a huge leap that this specifically became an icon even more so than the original so much so that this was still being sold up until 2014 as the entry-level iPad even outlasting the three and the four but it's with this third iPad that things start to get a little strange see logic would dictate that if your iPad sold well your iPad 2 sold Gang Busters that all you have to do is to keep making the same kinds of improvements and to call it the iPad free what Apple actually did was call this new iPad the new iPad what this will never make sense to me how can any product ever be named the new something cuz what do they think happens when it's not new anymore hey I'm here to repair my new iPad I got the new iPad yeah well I mean I got it like 3 years ago you got the new iPad 3 years ago yep are you sure it's not the new old iPad well it's not you know the new iPad but it is the new iPad if you get me I'm not paid enough for this the key new thing this time was after Apple saw the reaction to the retina display on their iPhone 4 they knew that they had to bring that Tech to the iPads 2o and it was an especially massive jump here because there was already a lot of pixels to start with this brought the iPad up to one of the highest resolution displays on the market full stop I mean just look at the difference in the Safari icon this kind of clarity would have felt surreal in 2012 so that part of it was great it's just basically the rest of it like the A5 chip in the iPad 2 became the a5x in the iPad 3 which was frankly a tiny Improvement this iPad had the same amount of storage the same 30 pin connector I mean it looks identical it was the first iPad technically with support for LTE networks but even that was a problem despite advertising the iPad 3 as a 4G LTE device it actually couldn't communicate with LTE networks outside of the US due to the use of different radio frequencies which led to Apple being sued across multiple countries and at the same time while Apple was starting to get comfortable the Android competition was starting to heat up up until this point yes there had been plenty of Android tablets but they were awfully optimized they were so buggy and laggy that they' actually created a bad reputation for Android tablets as just the knockoff alternative to iPad but Google was paying very close attention to the surprising take up of the iPad and they invested very heavily around this time in creating a tablet optimized version of Android Android 3.0 honeycomb man it feels so good to talk about this again these honeycomb tablets were actually something I was covering in the very early days of this Channel and they were great you could find something at every price point they were way more customizable than Apple and since they were now running a software that was specifically designed for tablets they actually used the large available screen space better plus by the time Android 4.0 rolled out Google was also starting to fix the single main thing holding Android back the lag which all put together meant that Apple's market share was tumbling fast all the way from 85% the year of the first iPad to 44% now and I think seeing all of this happen Apple started to get a little bitter they felt like they were the ones who started this whole smartphone and smart tablet thing and everyone else was just copying them particularly Samsung so it's at this point that Apple decided to try and sue them they claimed that Samsung copied everything from the design to the screen icons and even core patented features like tap to zoom and bounceback which allows your screen to show the surface beneath a document the funny part of this though is that that failed because the High Court ruled that there was no way any consumer would ever confuse the two devices because Samsung was and I quote not as cool so I mean no one really wins here but this ended up being just the beginning of what would become the absolutely brutal 7-year suing and counter doing Conquest between these two companies and the waters only got muddier later that same year because it wasn't just full-size Android tablets that were starting to become popular it was smaller 7in ones too because remember most phone screens at this time were still only like 4 in now Steve Jobs had historically hated this idea he believed that users needed the iPad's larger 9.7 in screen to actually do anything useful but there was another Apple exac Eddie Q who had been pushing for a 7-in iPad since 2011 through internal emails and eventually he won job over I think it's so fascinating to see how Apple was thinking at the time look at this subject why I just dumped the iPad hint Size Matters having used a Samsung Galaxy I agree with many of the comments below I believe there will be a 7-in market and we should do one and so alongside the next generation iPad 4 which yes came out the same year as the iPad 3 sorry new iPad Apple also released the iPad mini and to be completely honest I don't think it was all that exciting Apple had clearly decided that the kind of user who'd be looking for a mini tablet wasn't someone who would care about The Cutting Edge so the iPad Mini is basically just a tiny iPad 2 in terms of specs and it came out at $329 the cool part though is that yes even though this was just an iPad 2 on the inside the thinner display technology available now and the new unibody outer shell which had fewer Parts meant that instead of the iPad Mini being thicker than the iPad 2 like you would expect given that it's shorter and narrower it's actually thinner too this this thing is just 7.2 mm thin much thinner than Apple's competitors at the time like the Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Fire HD the former being arguably the first major Android tablet success story and for the market they were targeting this was absolutely the right thing to focus on it meant that this technically inferior iPad Mini actually far outsold the iPad 4 that it released alongside supply chain numbers suggest Apple was restocking this thing at two times the rate which you could sort of see coming from the most M the iPad Mini was first unveiled on stage oh yeah this is also where Apple introduced the lightning port to the iPad which in one sense felt like the future it could support higher transfer speeds faster charging it was way neater and less bulky and unlike the industry standard micro USB at the time completely reversible but on the other hand users and reviewers weren't completely jazzed that apple had gone from one self-made proprietary cable straight to another making the old cable Obsolete and requiring a whole new set of accessories oh unless you pick up the $30 adapter but the fourth gen fullsize iPad was still the true Flagship of 2012 and since Apple attributed a lot of the iPad success so far to its pricing they kept it again for the fourth year in a row this was $499 even though when you factor in inflation that's actually about 20% cheaper than the first model also a lightning cable here and the Machine itself which actually sparked quite a bit of drama from people who just bought the previous gen only to have this thing drop 7 months later feels particularly cruel given the naming on that iPad this was a massive chipset upgrade from the a5x to the a6x which made this about 2 and 1/2 times more powerful than the iPad 3 and so about 6.5 times more powerful than the original iPad but apart from that and upgrading the front camera from 0.3 to 1.2 map there is basically nothing new it's literally iPad 3 maybe they should have just called this the newer iPad do you know what they actually called it iPad 4 was officially sold under the name iPad with retina display even though they just previously released the iPad with retina display so you took the old feature from the new iPad that's really now the old iPad and used it to name the actually new iPad Apple what are you doing I think it's pretty clear that Apple themselves were confused with what to do with iPad you could tell that all of this was not one person calling the shots but a divided boardroom and if anything reinforces that idea is the fact that the following year instead of a fifth generation iPad Apple instead released yet another new category the iPad Air I remember seeing this thing get announced on stage apple called this the biggest step yet in achieving the vision of the iPad and the crowd seemed pretty happy about it now obviously to invent a whole new name for this iPad it must be a lot thinner and lighter right well yes actually the very first iPad was 680 G the most recent iPad 4 was 652 G the iPad Air was just 469 and making that much of a change to what was already a very optimized design that requires a lot of work Apple had to eliminate the air gap between the front glass and the LCD panel which also at the same time improves the picture quality the aluminium frame was Slimmer and these smaller size bezels they were not just an aesthetic win but also meant that you need less material but the thing that made the most difference Apple Shrunk The Battery by a good 30% but still managed to keep the same end battery life through a pretty massive leap in efficiency with their new A7 chip that also happened to double the performance of the last iPad these numbers are really really impressive and so even though this might look just like an upsized iPad Mini it's the power and The Branding of iPad Air that I think was a big part of the thing success I think air just makes it feel very clearly new you felt like you were buying something that was distinctly impossible the last year but I think the most interesting part of this is that the iPad Air launched with iOS 7 the first ever major iOS redesign and on one hand this just feels right Apple's lightest iPad releasing alongside their lightest feeling software iOS 7 got rid of all complicated 3D shapes and replaced them with nearly shadowless flat icons thinner text and pler backgrounds I remember my friends showing me the new iOS in the playground and it distinctly feeling like the future this flat design was what the entire industry was moving towards at the time but when I look back I also can't help but feel like the original iOS icons had so much more charm iOS 7 also does feel a bit characterless by comparison but this is where things get taken up another notch because in all this time making iPads there's one thing that Apple hadn't tried yet we've had iPad but small we've had iPad but thin and in 2015 Apple decided it was time for iPad but big and not just in size this is the absolutely ginormous iPad Pro the Big Daddy of iPads I could not for the life of me find one of these Brand New by the way so this one is used but barely now credit wear credits due I I actually think it's pretty great that Apple managed to at first release the iPad at $499 and then keep hitting that price year after year while making the product significantly better that said Pro is where the company makes up for that lost ground with a starting price of $799 so this needs to be a massive Improvement and well you got a new chip the a9x which is a very healthy 1.9x improvement over the previous a8x that Apple used in the iPad Air 2 and an enormous 3.4x jumper over the A7 in the original iPad Air at the same time if the iPad Airs are getting these super high performance X Series chips then what's actually Pro about the iPad Pro well it's massive this 12.9 in display is practically laptop sized we now have a quad speaker setup which actually let's do a quick demo so this is the iPad Air it's actually pretty good although highly directional considering that the speakers both face downwards and then with the iPad Pro we move from two to four speakers and they are all around the device it's not that much louder but it's way more immersive there's a camera upgrade to 8 mapel which I'm sure is exactly what the pros were pining for and the introduction of this the apple pencil which is particularly interesting because styluses are something that Steve Jobs used to hate you have to get them and put them away and you lose them yuck plus does it not feel like the entire existence of the iPad Pro was something Steve Jobs would have questioned the way that he saw the the world was big old PC computers were like trucks there'd always be some people who need them but that's a minority the majority of people will use cars and in this analogy job saw the iPad is the car and so in a way this iPad Pro makes a lot of sense of course you'll have some people who don't want a truck but do want a more Super top Pro car but then isn't that what the MacBook is for and you're about to see the relationship between these two products get more and more murky also I find this so cool let's say you're finding your existing wallpaper a little bit too bland if I pull up the Opera browser our sponsor make me an iPad wallpaper in this style but more colorful and Boulder see what it spits out wa and Bam it looks like a really nice evolution of the original and Opera just got an update too which now gives you a movable music player dynamic themes which go absolutely crazy and are fully customizable but also they have basically fixed the hassle of manually resizing Windows while trying to multitask with split screen not to mention I'm a big believer in the whole clear room clear mind philosophy I don't work well with mess around me and that's a big part of why I gravitate towards Opera because tab Islands let you stay completely organized and therefore very much in the zone even if your room isn't link below to download the Opera browser for free now Apple did release a pro second generation in 2017 but it was a pretty unexciting incremental upgrade it's only in 2018 when things got really interesting this is the iPad Pro third gen now at $999 and the way the Apple Justified the second major price hike is that this was a complete redesign and you can tell gone are the Uber minimalist boxes of old the new iPad was all about color this is where Apple decided that the kinds of people that the pro iPad should appeal to were creatives so they really leaned into that you got the iPad the insert does still have the same stuff in it as the very first model but you can tell they've really neatened up the presentation of everything there's now a USBC cable which I'm getting to and the iPad itself which has not just a new design but equally exciting a new matte packaging extra crispy now I have to say I noticed a change in apple around this time partly I think because iPad market share was falling hitting just 24% in 2015 because of more competition from Samsung and Lenovo and iPhones now being offered in larger fablet sizes and partly because this is where Apple's mobile a series chipsets started to get really fast put these two things together and this is where you notice Apple starting to go straight for the computer users right from the very launch event of the iPad Pro 3 they touted how the new a2x bionic processor was faster than 92% of portable PCS with overall system performance 2.8 times faster than the Gen 1 iPad Pro making it around 124 times faster than the very first iPad and 421 times faster than the first iPhone not to mention this was the first iPad with a USBC port and the EU didn't even need to tell them to do it this was clearly part of the new Apple strategy where the iPad was pitched as a great alternative to a Windows computer with this port allowing it to be hooked up to a 5k resolution monitor as well as giving it compatibility with a whole bunch of pro accessories the storage capacity was now up to 1 tbte this is the first iPad with face ID so out with the home button we got a 120 HZ promotion display and also just generally this is just such a nice neatening and sharpening up of the way the iPad looks it feels way more intentional now but the main reason this iPad was such big news for me a massive reduction and just as important evening of the bezels around the screen this moved the iPad from tablet to Magic sheet of glass as Apple calls it cuz you can use it just as easily from every angle and you know what this new Windows laptop targeting strategy was actually kind of working Apple's market share started to pick up once again so they kept doubling down on this Mantra with the iPad Pro 4 in 20120 your next computer is not a computer they said it came with massively upgraded cameras a new liar sensor which in hindsight was quite a few years too early to be of much use to any consumer and then the a12z bionic chipset God Apple please stick to one naming convention I'm begging you and it made basically no difference to Performance one pretty large development was the new magic keyboard you could get with it which also included a trackpad you sure it's not a computer Tim but this was especially strange since the selfie camera which you'd be using for calls was still on the top Edge which made no sense since Apple were clearly trying to push you to use the device horizontally the biggest change though between the last iPad and this one is the iPad's second big software overhaul iPad OS it's hard to believe but up until this point every iPad was just running the same iOS that iPhones were running but in order to Target their appeal to computer users Apple had to convince them that they were getting more than just what their phones already could do so iPad OS launched with a redesigned home screen that could fit more apps long overdue but it did fix the frankly ridiculous looking spacing that iPads had up until this point there's new widgets Safari would now also automatically give you the desktop version of sites scaled for the iPad display and optimized for touch it wasn't immediately a massive change but it needed to happen eventually since the way people use their phones is very different to the way they use their Tablets before long Apple's market share was back up to 38% helped imp part thanks to a growing middle class in Emerging Markets who could actually afford their premium product at which point Apple decided you know what it's time for another price hike $1,099 was what the 2021 iPad Pro fifth gen launched at and to well and truly solidify that not a computer but basically a computer was the direction that Apple wanted to go in this time around Apple actually managed to squeeze in the M1 laptop grade chip inside of the iPad the entire history of iPads thus far have been powered by a series chips the same series of chips that go into your phone but as the latest attempt to try and get get away from the reputation of the iPad just being a Netflix machine this time they tried to focus on giving you something different under the hood now in a way this is all a little arbitrary the M series chips are based on the same architecture as the a series chips they're just beefed up but then that's like any other normal chip upgrade would be anyways this iPad is about 1.5 times faster than the last gen but still considering that Apple's tablets were already at this point far more powerful than most Android competition sticking another 50% onto that lead is still kind of a lot that said cool as it is to have an M1 chip and the now up to 16 GB of RAM and 2 terab of storage this Behemoth of a tablet can come with I don't know who exactly was using it to its limit on an iPad given that the base software is still not that far off iph software to return to the Steve Jobs analogy this combination of Chip and product is a bit like taking the engine of a truck and sticking it into a car the car still can't go above the speed limit and it's never going to need to carry more than five people because they won't fit inside it anyway one thing that everyone could appreciate though is this new screen in one Fell Swoop it was goodbye to the IPS LCD panels of old hello mini LED liquid retina xdr God Apple can you just please name things in plain English but this basically means that instead of one big backlight this display has thousands of mini LEDs each with their own backlight allowing for way higher Peak brightness also big upgrade to the the front-facing camera it's now a 12 megapix Ultra wide specifically to allow for a new Apple feature called center stage where the camera can follow you around the room I wish the camera could literally follow me to the correct side of the device though the 2022 iPads were when Apple started to Eco up their packaging so you'll notice no outside plastic wrap that's part of the fun gone but you can tell they have still obsessed over how to still give this thing that fresh new product feeling we got the same insert the same power brick Oh but now the USBC cable is braided which is an important Improvement for durability and Tangle resistance something the original Apple cables were pretty notorious for got to say they have done a pretty slick job swapping out the plastic for fiber while still retaining that crispy fresh iPad feeling now aside from one admittedly cool upgrade to the apple pencil which now shows a Digital Shadow above your screen when you hover this iPad basically just existed for people who like to say that my iPad has more M's than yours it had an M2 Chip instead of an M1 making it 1.2 times more powerful but you know what as strange as Apple's product strategy is starting to feel with their quest to take on Windows laptops actually just making them feel more and more like MacBooks each year the market share has just kept climbing with the iPad Pro becoming Apple's bestselling iPad and apple ending 2022 with 46% of the market the way that I think Apple's looking at this is yes every time we give the iPad a new Pro feature we are slightly cannibalizing the MacBook but at the same time we're making the iPad less pointless and I think the way Apple sees it the iPad has a way better chance than the MacBook of becoming the bestselling mainstream computer but the Seventh Generation really feels like the crowning Jewel of the iPad line and it's at this point where they've fully given the iPad packaging the iPhone treatment it's far thinner inside you got the iPad surprisingly similar layout internally it's just now you get no power brick I do like this though a black braided cable to match the black iPad color I've gone for and let's be very clear I think this device is bordering on a miracle to be honest it is 5.1 mm thick for starters just look at this versus the original iPad the difference is phenomenal and like I said earlier I'm not as fuss when it comes to the thickness of a phone but on a 13-in tablet where it's the difference between being comfortable with two hands and being comfortable to use with just one hand it matters it's got a tandem OLED display display which means that instead of just one layer of backlit lighting this screen now has two stacked on top of each other so the brightness is unexpectedly High amusingly Apple actually downgraded the cameras and they kind of tried to hide it as you can see cuz the ultra wide camera was here and it just swapped it for the lar sensor which was previously here but they have finally fixed the front camera by sticking it on the landscape side not to mention the new Apple pencil Pro which now lets you squeeze to bring up new tools and Barrel Roll to rotate the part of the nib you're drawing with it really does feel like apple bottled up two generations worth of upgrades into one here which reminds me it's kind of crazy how far the iPad has come from Steve Jobs's original Vision both in ways that would have amazed him how the thing practically started off as a portable email machine and now it's a almost do whatever you want machine but maybe also appalled by with all this apple pencil stuff and to be fair his original complaint of you needing a place to put the pencil still holds true cuz the thing does just fall off when you rattle it oh yeah and if you liked being able to brag about the number two before oh boy you must have been very excited when they announced that these iPads somehow got the M4 chip before the MacBooks this is stupidly powerful for its diminutive thickness a further 1.5x more powerful than the previous Pro 345 times more powerful than the iPad 1 and astonishingly about 1,170 times more powerful than the original iPhone but I have covered this in a separate video in detail if you want to see that so yeah this has been an absolute monster of a video to put together especially with all this new house stuff going on like this is the fourth first gen iPad that we've had to buy to actually get one that works so hope you liked it and I will catch you in the next one oh yeah and before the comments this is not the next gen Mr who's the boss Studio this is a cinema room"

pMX2cQdPubk,Talking Tech and AI with Tim Cook!,AI...Siri... magic mouse... we talk about it all WWDC 2024 Recap: https://youtu.be/qkYoBNdcXBU MKBHD Merch: http://shop.,Marques Brownlee,2024-06-12T15:56:11Z,28,"['Tim Cook', 'Tim Cook Interview', 'Apple Intelligence', 'mkbhd', 'MKBHD', 'Talking tech with Tim Cook', 'talking tech', 'Tim Cook AI', 'Apple CEO']",PT16M33S,3171261,9515,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology'],True,"(upbeat music) - All right, Tim. - Great to see you. - Thanks for spending the time. - Thank you for coming. So you had the WWDC keynote today. - Yeah. - Which was really fun to
watch. It was a whole two hours. I wanna zoom all the way out, 'cause, obviously, a lot of
talk about AI in general. - [Tim] Yeah. - And I'm kind of just left wondering how Apple defines AI in general, because I know, if you
ask a regular person, you might hear about
generative AI, chat bots, things like that. - Yeah. - And these are relatively new additions to Apple's AI portfolio. How do you look at AI as Apple? - Well, we've been executing
with AI for a long time. - [Marques] Right. - It's at the, you're wearing a watch. It's at the root of the watch. I mean, you think about
things like crash detection, fall detection, things like Afib, and all of this kind of stuff is machine learning at the end of the day, and so, but what has
captured people's imagination is generative AI, and we
see it as the opportunity for a whole new curve of technology and providing and doing
more things for people, providing an assistant for people, things that really improve people's lives. So that's how we see it. Obviously, it's not without downside, and so we approach it very thoughtfully. - Sure. - And as you heard, we have
always been focused on privacy, and so privacy is a very key
tenet of our thrust into AI. - Right. It's been interesting to
watch Apple's arc with AI. 'cause I made a whole piece,
not more than about a year ago, about how Apple seems to never say AI, even though they have
all these neural engines and machine learning and things like that. - Yeah. - And so now we have almost this pivot, where now we're just saying it. We're actually branding
it Apple Intelligence now. I'm curious why that changed now. - Well, in the beginning, and throughout almost
everything that we always do, we always talk about
the benefit to the user, and so the benefit to the user is crash detection and fall detection, not the technology behind the feature. - Sure. - And so we still view it like that, but it became clear that people wanted to know our views on generative AI in particular. - [Marques] Yeah. - And so we decided to embrace it and called it Apple Intelligence. - Okay. I have a quote from the Dua
Lipa interview that you did. - [Tim] Oh, okay. - [Marques] That was great. - [Tim] It was fun. She's fantastic. - I loved it. It was great. You had a quote that said, about AI, ""If it can be used for nefarious things, we won't go down that road."" - Yeah. - And at the time, I assumed that that meant generative
AI was off the table, 'cause of all the things
that we've seen about what it was potentially capable of or things that it might do. Has that changed? Is that something that was off the table and you figured now
you've got the right tools or the right restrictions to make sure that that
all goes super well? How do you think about that? - Generative AI was never off the table. It was always about pursuing
it in a thoughtful kind of way, and so that's what we've done, and we've implemented it in ways that are less likely to create issues. - How so? - How so? Well, things that, if you think about the kinds of things that we talked about, we talked about personal context and we talked about privacy,
and so we are not waiting for a comprehensive privacy
legislation regulation to come into effect. We already view privacy as
a fundamental human right, and so that's the lens that we see it at, and given that we're doing those things, personal context and privacy, we wanted to integrate it at a deep level, so you're not having to think, ""Oh, well, now I want to do something that uses Intelligence."" We put it into the apps
that you're already using. - Right. - And integrate it in deeply. - Right. Yeah. I think also, now, there's
a lot of talk about it now that there is generative AI. - [Tim] Yeah. - A lot of people have, I mean, Apple's notorious for never
sending anything to the cloud. Everything's on device, because that is the most
secure way to do it, and was applauded for it. Interestingly, this is a
little bit different now. With a lot of these larger
models, more complex requests, you actually do have to
go off of the device, so you've developed, I
wanna get the name right. Private Cloud Compute.
- Private Cloud Compute. - Explain this to us, because I think the
general chatter online is, well, they have to be sending
data to OpenAI, for example, to get a request back from ChatGPT. - Well, there's Private Cloud Compute, and then there's the
arrangement with OpenAI. These two things are different. - Okay. - And so if you look at
Private Cloud Compute, we're utilizing the same
silicon, or not the same silicon, but the same basic architecture
as the silicon that's in- - [Marques] Right. - Well, that's in the iPhone. - 15. Yeah, right. - And we're using the same software, and so we believe that
we've done it in such a way that it's as safe and secure and private in the Private Cloud
Compute as the device, and so we really worked on this a lot and put a lot of wood behind
that arrow to ensure that. If you're working on something that requires world knowledge,
so you're out of the domain of personal context and so forth. - Yeah. - Then you may want to go and use one of the large language models that are on the market, and we selected what
we feel is the best one with OpenAI and ChatGPT, but you'll make a conscious
decision to do that - Every time. - Every time. - So you can guarantee that there will never be
any data sent to OpenAI without your explicit user- - That's right. That's right. You decide. - Right. I also feel like there
was this blip on the radar of stand-alone AI devices, which
I found really interesting. They didn't land too well. I think smartphones are pretty great, but there was an interesting
conversation around that, about using your phone less, maybe having AI help you out in ways that let you spend less
time on the screen, and this is something you echoed also in the Dua Lipa interview. Like, if you're looking at your phone more than you're looking
at someone else's eyes, something's off there. - Yeah. - Do you think there's a potential future where we're using our phones less because of how well
the Intelligence works? - I think it's a possibility
and a significant possibility. I mean, for us, we've never
been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices. Our model is not one that
needs engagement to succeed. Our model is one where
we want to empower you to be able to do things
you couldn't do otherwise. We want to give you a tool so
you can do incredible things that you couldn't do without the tool. That's what motivates us, and so, you know, we
come out with things like Screen Time, et cetera,
so it's a bit in your face as to how much you're using your device. - True. - We come out with, we count
your notifications and so forth so that you can go in and say, ""Do I really want this
many notifications?"" And we have focus kinds of states where you can silence
the phone, et cetera, and so I do believe that, as things get smarter and
smarter with Apple Intelligence, that you can even take things
that were taking more time will take less time now. - Right. - And so I do think
that opportunity exists. - Interesting. Yeah. It's a curious future. - It is. It is, and I think I'm
really optimistic about it. - Yeah. I also feel like there was tons of chatter when you were first CEO of Apple, about this new shift, obviously,
coming from Steve Jobs, and you've been CEO for what
feels like a long time now, and we're entering this new age of AI, and I'm curious now. Now, there's new chatter about who the next CEO is gonna be. What do you feel like your
legacy as CEO at Apple should be? - Yeah, Marques, I don't think about it. - Okay. - And so, to me, a legacy is
something that is defined by other people looking at you, not something that you define yourself. - Very fair. - And so, and I typically am always
focused on the forward, not the rear-view mirror, and that is a characteristic
of Apple in general, is we're very focused on the forward. You won't find a museum here, and yet we would have lots of things that you might like to
see and reminisce about, but we just don't. It's just not a part of our culture. - [Marques] Yeah. - And so I feel the same way personally. At some point, there will be another CEO, and my whole focus in life will be on making them successful. - Yeah. I like that answer. It's a very LeBron answer. I feel like he said something- - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. All right. I wanna end with a little game. I don't know if you've seen these, where it's a blind ranking. Have you seen what these are? - A blind ranking? - A blind ranking. So we're gonna do a top five
Apple products of all time, but I'm gonna give you them one at a time, and you don't know what
the rest of them are. So you have to rank the first one without knowing what two,
three, four, and five are. - Oh.
- Okay. - And this is your ranking? - This will be your unofficial ranking, just based on your gut reaction of how you feel about the products. - All right, this is a tough one because- - It is a tough one. - It's like asking you your favorite kids or nephews or nieces. - We'll see how it goes. - Yeah. Okay, number one. MacBook Air. Had that iconic moment of, like, taking it out the envelope on stage. It's the most popular laptop
in the world, I think. - It's the most popular in the world, and that moment of taking
it out of the folder established a characteristic about that device that lives today. The first one, it wasn't about
how many people would buy it. - [Marques] Yeah. - It was about establishing
the foundation. - Was that the first Air product? - Of any line? - Yeah. It might have been. - I believe so. Yes. - Okay. - I believe so, and so I'm gonna fail miserably
at giving you a ranking, but it was a huge moment. - [Marques] Yeah. - A huge moment for the company. - The iPad. - Oh, wow. You know, tablets had been in
the market for a long time. Our objective is never to be first. Our objective is to be best. - I remember all the
rumors leading up to it. - And there were many
rumors leading up to it, and people thought many things that weren't too
nice about it in the beginning, including the name, and yet I couldn't live
without my iPad today. - [Marques] Yeah. - And so another huge
moment for the company. - My number three is the Magic Mouse. - The Magic Mouse. It was also an incredible moment. People don't think of that as much as they would the MacBook Air and the iPad and whatever else you're
going to name probably, but getting the ergonomics well done was key. - With the Magic Mouse. - [Tim] Yeah. - Okay. Four out of five, the iPhone. - Oh my God. It changed the world. - It definitely changed the world. - It changed the world, and the simplicity of
defining the three things. - [Marques] Yeah. - That were on the phone was brilliant to get people to think about it like that, and, of course, opening up, this isn't talked about as much, but, initially, you'll remember that there was not an App Store. - Right. - The App Store came a year later, and that changed everything
in the developer community, because, now, I meet
with students every WWDC, and they give me such great inspiration. There were no students in
the developer community at that particular point in time. Now, the developer
population is very diverse from an age point of
view and everything else, and it just, fundamentally, it became an economic miracle for people, and got well outside of
just doing it for a hobby. You look at all the businesses
that came out of it. - Yeah, and now we have WWDC. - That's right. - Last but not least, Vision Pro. - Oh. I love Vision Pro. I was just using it last night
to look at the screening. - Yeah. What do you use Vision Pro for? I ask everybody who has
one what they use it for. - I use it for the entertainment value. I use it when I want to do multitasking, because I find the multiple windows really effective in doing this. Of course, I'm reviewing
lots of app on it right now, and some of those are enterprise apps, some people's proprietary apps that they wanna share with us, and I'm seeing an extraordinary number and variety of things coming
out of the enterprise area, far earlier than we would've predicted. - Interesting. - Because businesses
generally move slow to adopt. - [Marques] Yeah. - And what we're seeing is
that half of the Fortune 100 is now buying Vision Pro for
some project or the other, or exploring it. - [Marques] Interesting. - And so I'm looking at
several of those and, yeah, I find that it's still
an emotional experience to look at your photos,
and with visionOS 2, being able to take your old photos. - [Marques] Yeah. - [Tim] And make them 3D, I
think is a big, big thing. - [Marques] Yeah. - And, you know, I lost both of my parents before Vision Pro came out,
and being able to go back and look at those photos differently is something that, you know, it's an experience you can't replicate. - For sure. Well, we didn't get a blind ranking, but we got a pretty good retrospective. - Yeah. - Of some of these products. Thanks again for your time.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- I'm looking forward to when the next feature
drops in the next WW, but this was fun. Thank you.
- Yeah, it was great fun. Thank you for coming. - Same. (upbeat music)"

I genuinely have no idea what this can do I'm pretty sure it doesn't have the internet though [Music] this is going to be very interesting extremely interesting because I obviously I spend most of my day at the computer not one of these I'm really scared that it's going to blow up I'm also scared that it's not going to turn on so are you ready three two one get out of town hello and welcome to what's on my Mac 1987 Edition so we have got a trash can down here and Microsoft Word up here but wait there's more because Microsoft Word is actually this weird finder type thing and inside of it you've got games oh I can so imagine myself wasting time on this 40 years ago you've also got drawing and of course you've got super soft word dude I love this keyboard admittedly wow that's flattering admittedly I can actually do a lot of my work just typing so I'm gonna do that and I'll see you on the other side [Music] I have just come to the tragic realization that it is now dinner time and I have not used my phone once side note while this phone does actually still turn on it runs on an analog Network which means it doesn't work but fear not for I have come up with a high-tech solution Motorola flip phone velcro I'm going to take matters into my own hands and I'm going to order dinner [Music] okay so you have to pay on the website okay no worries thank you bye-bye damn it who needs Pizza when you've got microwave rice and beans right guys no I'm kidding this actually is really nice I survived I survived day one baby we survived I mean you had to watch this camera all day you feel me so typically at this point I would watch a movie on a streaming service it is here that I must once again interject for while I did have a TV and VHS player from the 80s in one of the great twists of irony I'm really scared that it's going to blow up as soon as I put a tape into the player the TV literally started smoking I'm not sure if this is a feature of TVs from the 80s but I decided probably best to turn it off and just go to bed well howdy Partners so I just made breakfast listening to Bohemian Rhapsody on my Walkman and I have never felt cooler in my life yesterday I realized that there are a few things I thought I would be fine without I'm not going to be fine with that an alarm clock for example a paper book a paper map you know I'm in my car but I don't have the navigation so that's fun add to that list a TV that doesn't smoke perhaps a few more VHS tapes now I don't know about you guys but if you ask me there's only one place I'm gonna find all this stuff oh no walk up to the club like what up I got a big [Music] what a time to be alive my friends I found everything it did take about eight hours tomorrow I can wake up on time I can read my book I can watch a movie tonight it is actually getting dark and I'm gonna get a pizza [Music] I'm so excited I'm so excited I've just set up the non-fire hazard TV and VHS player which means all we have to do is pick a movie say less bro please do not blow up on me I would be grateful eternally oh you're lucky when something smell Smoky right now am I gaslighting myself oh it works oh it doesn't work oh it works okay yes we have a deep Cherry Tree Line yesterday all right come on with me all right hey guys I'm just here to tell you that that's three four and five really boring I mean I did leave the house once to get food for my cat but apart from that holy crap apart from that I was just you know using the technology he microwaved rice and beans holy crap can you see where they used to do this wow foreign [Music] my dudes this morning I've procrastinated for about three hours reading my book and now I'm further procrastinating rating the computer manual to be fair this is a really good computer manual you know as far as computer manuals Go I mean just the pictures alone they don't make them like they used to you know what I mean it's also fascinating to see like you know copy paste was a foreign concept back then if they still made computer manuals with this many pictures I'd probably actually read them or at least flick through the pictures thank you so much cheers have a good one right how cultured am I right now check the vibes yeah yeah I'll be right there honey this is actually the first time I've seen the news all week in fact it's the first time I've ever bought a newspaper in my life I'm actually having a good time [Applause] yeah okay all right well I'll catch you later then [Music] bye spoiler alert I wasn't even on the phone just said I was acting acting was that good [Applause] the only thing I really missed from my smartphone is how you can kind of just you know quick draw random crap I can't see torch I want tickets to a movie kitchen a why do bagels have holes in them Google speaking of movies I'm about to go and see one and actually speaking of bagels I just ate one so wow that was convenient as far as I just go up to the kiosk and ask for what do I say hey man two uh tickets to your next movie please so what's showing today why do I keep doing an American accent [Music] well here we are my friends day seven this morning I was feeling a little introspective uh is that the right word I'm not sure I drove all the way up to the forest to go for a run and it was a lovely run actually until I slipped over you know got mud on my butt so thanks 1980. [Music] okay I know that this is the last day and therefore this is largely unnecessary but I'm driving home and would it be a sin would it be a sin to just [Music] oh sorry these just some books I picked up at the thrift store no biggie I mean they are big I guess didn't really think about it the complete works of Shakespeare probably whack that out in the weekend you know what I'm saying and so as the sun kisses The Horizon wow that's a good line I actually just made that up anyway to give you guys a little something I printed off of my Mac a really Brief Review of 1980s technology by a guy from the 2020s me the Motorola Dyna Tech 8000x a surprisingly adequate communication device unfortunately it pulls my pants down every time I'm not wearing a belt so probably won't use it again four out of ten the Sony Walkman I have literally nothing bad to say about this it's perfect I mean the buttons alone if you ask me it's a 10 out of 10. it just is the Macintosh SE is not particularly functional in the modern world but I mean typing's fun and that one animal game so five out of ten the TV and VHS player assuming it doesn't burn your house down let's yeah six out of ten if I'm not mistaken I've just stumbled upon a pay phone in the wild a pay phone I didn't even know they still existed maybe it doesn't work I feel like I have to try wow holy crap this is ancient dude it's making a sound do I just dial a number oh hi there I'm just wondering if I could order a pizza for pickup awesome thank you so much cheers bye-bye wow it works holy crap wow that was awesome [Music] the time is 11 30. we are a mere 30 minutes away from going back to the future I am going to thoroughly enjoy this pizza and by that time we'll probably be done I'm sad I don't want to leave the 80s it's just been like no notifications and pizza ah yes please [Music] hey look I don't even need Google to tell you it's because without the whole it's just a bread roll in a way it is the whole that defines the bagel so there's your answer probably

Ax9a_X2uE6g,Unboxing Samsung&#39;s HUGE New 8K Flagship TV,The New Samsung Neo QLED 8k TV with its advanced AI features makes it one of the best AI TV's on the market. Check out the ...,Unbox Therapy,2024-08-27T15:22:33Z,28,"['unbox therapy', 'unboxtherapy', 'tech', 'technology', 'gadgets', 'gadget', 'unboxing', 'review', 'unbox', 'therapy', 'new', 'youtube']",PT11M9S,2845854,1612,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,so we have the latest champion status from Samsung this is the top of the food chain for their displays it is the new qn 900d which is their latest 8K display this is the top dog because it's the 85 in version and it now has built-in AI upscaling they claim that now you're going to take your 4K content or even lower resolution content and you're going to finally be able to benefit from having an 8K display to upscale that to look better than it's ever looked I should also mention we have their Soundbar so we're going to have the complete Flagship setup this one is called the q990 D and the cool thing about these is you actually have a pretty decent integrated audio system inside the TV and it's going to sync up with the Soundbar so you can actually utilize the entirety of the sound system the speakers that are on the TV already and the Soundbar together to create a more immersive audio experience to go with the visual experience with AI apparently now now we're going to have a 4K image that actually looks like 8K sort of almost maybe let's set it up and find out now what Samsung does with their Flagship models they try to make them as Slim as possible so when you have these things mounted or even on their stand they're not just Slim in terms of the bezel which is the smallest it's been on this model but also the actual profile of the TV is is it's like a pencil now one of the ways they do do this is by creating a connection box that is separate from the actual TV and it actually makes things a little easier when you have the display mounted it can be tough depending on the type of Mount you have to get access to the back of a TV so Samsung just says okay look the TV is incredibly thin you're going to have this connection box which is separate and you're going to have better access to it and you're going to get a nicer design because of it so we have a number of different components here now the other thing to mention about the one connect box is if you don't want to have it sit separately that's fine too you can actually mount it to the top portion of the existing stand so it can kind of sit behind the TV in that case it would act like as if you had the ports directly on the TV so it has flexibility from that standpoint I think in most cases and at least for me I prefer to have it separate just makes accessing those ports a little bit easier and then you have the singular cable going to this one connect portion over here here is a very short one connect cable that can go from here into the display if you do have the one connect box mounted directly to the display and then we have a slightly longer one here if you want to have it come down into a media console or just mounted somewhere else it reminds me a little bit of a game console just way thinner and I should mention at this point this display should be great for game consoles as well it actually is capable of up to 240 HZ refresh so that's pretty wild all right power cable on the side which is recessed four HDMI ports including one EC you can see the little game controller there as well two usba ports another us usba Port here we have an antenna connection point of course there's also Lan for a wired internet connection you have Optical for audio and then the one connect Port so the stand has to be pretty robust obviously for an 855 in TV I should also mention that if you're looking at Samsung's flagship TVs there are other sizes available however when it comes to 8K you kind of want the biggest TV you can get so you can take advantage of those extra pixels if you're familiar with Samsung remotes this will be a comfortable place for you you have dedicated buttons for Netflix Disney plus Prime video volume channels home button like they've tried to make it I guess as simple as possible but what I'm most excited by is not native 8K content because as mentioned there's almost none of it I mean you can go on YouTube the stuff there is not even extremely high bit rate some of the 8K stuff looks awesome but it's like demo videos and like I don't know the odd nature video or something it's cool but the majority of the content you're going to want to watch is going to need to be upscaled and that's Samsung's entire pitch with this display let's get the TV set up and see what that looks like all right so everything is set up now including the surround sound which actually looks pretty good I like this industrial look this display is staggering like it is large scale obviously we're looking at an 85 in display and it almost seems like it shouldn't even stand up considering how slim it is and it is Slim all the way across it's pretty wild I mean like a fing finger width no less than a finger width it's like a pencil width insanely thin and one of the ways they're able to achieve that is with the one connect box I see that you have it mounted here Mo so I'll just pop this piece off which covers up some of your cabling so this sort of showcases how you'll run your cables through lots of opportunity connect your different devices plenty of HDMI ports so then you go ahead and just slap this piece on and that just keeps everything looking clean from the rear let's go ahead and get our peel which Mo has saved for me here what a peel it is I thought it might be a cool shot like landed in front of the L so our sound system starts with the sound bar in front which is going to cover your front and side channels and then we've got those rears in the back which are Wireless they're powered but wireless communication from the audio system nice little indicator light in order to tell you that they're linked up since they are linked wirelessly they do have some quarter threads if you do want to mount them on speaker stands rather than place them on industrial style cinder blocks which is what we do and then the subwoofer is back there as well that's a pretty substantial subwoofer the beauty with this Q Symphony setup is that all the audio becomes integrated the TV and the upgraded audio system can work together so there's no wasted audio equipment ooh all right so here we have some optimal 8K footage now you won't be surprised to know that 8K looks incredible on an 8K TV however depending on your seating distance and your Source material this experience can vary it is important with an 8K TV to scale up to the biggest size you can get and also to sit closer to it than you typically would on a 4K TV but if you do those things you end up with some pretty incredible imagery w who detail detail now the other thing worth talking about at this moment is the sound setup because we're using Q Symphony here we have a surround sound system with our sound bar our rear speakers which are connected wirelessly that's just power that you see going to them and of course the subwoofer what this does is make sure that you're not wasting the TV's built-in sound but instead it's a contributing factor into the overall surround sound experience and it's loud [Music] woo I'm at like 40 let's go to 100 let's go I'm at like [Music] 40 it's it's wild it's so easy to set up you got like one cable going back and forth that's it next thing you know you have a surround sound experience which enhances this image that you're paying so much for so you probably should think about adding the audio equipment as well now I mentioned how thin this thing is like thin profile but the bezel this screen I mean you can't even outside of going like right to the edge incredibly slim bezel it's it really is as close as you're going to get to edge to edge I mean it looks fantastic obviously we're talking about the Top Dog in Samsung's lineup we're talking about 8K we're talking about the best processor that they include in a television we're talking about extremely slim bezels so all you're looking at is your image I'm looking at 8K footage in its optimal setting in order to sort of showcase what the TV is capable of at its extreme and that's not even talking about the colors the saturation the ability to represent the dark right next to the light where these TVs have made such an improvement through panel technology but also through processing and the processing is the next piece worth talking about in fact Samsung says that your 4K footage is going to look 90% as good as your native 8K footage using their new AI upscaling 4K content like you might be watching on YouTube like you might be watching onbox therapy you can see here we're in 2160p however we're getting the latest upscaling in order to enhance this footage so it doesn't look low resolution on this display see that can be a problem your display can get so good that you start to analyze your Source material and say whoo I'm I'm lacking detailer this doesn't look as good as the 8K content well obviously it doesn't but in this case with this new processor and this AI enhancement Samsung is stating that you're going to get a lot closer to that 8K experience even when you're starting with footage that's lower resolution it's crazy we're calling 4K low reses in 2024 but it kind of is when you expose everything through such a sophisticated and detailed display also it EXP is our uh color grading because I'm red on one angle and white on the other this is their Tech demo to sort of explain what's going on inside it's called the nq8 AI gen 3 processor of course it's got AI in 2024 and AI obviously represents tremendous possibilities for upscaling images making predictions as we've seen on our computers when we're using certain software autofill and things like this AI is just outshining human capability in it ability to predict where pixels should be where detail should be and in this case how to upscale low resolution images lower resolution images it's kind of wild watching an ad for a TV on that TV that the ad is for which I've just discovered is the optimal way to view that ad that's the best way to watch that ad you need to buy the TV first to appreciate what's so good about your TV the caliber of visuals that they included as part of that Tech demo and then the native file in 8k is very convincing the big Focus here for Samsung is obviously ai ai ai ai when it comes to upscaling when it comes to motion enhancers it's all this modern TV tech that you're paying for when you're looking at a flagship model and this is the latest and greatest that's out there this is the 85 you can scale it down a little bit there are still a few options even though we are talking about a premium display [Music]

है नॉर्थ पोल के आर्कटिक रीजन की बर्फ सितंबर 1984 में और यह है उसी रीजन की बर्फ सितंबर 2019 में यह नासा द्वारा कैप्चर डाटा है जो दिखाता है कि सिर्फ 40 सालों के अंदर नॉर्थ पोल की बर्फ किस रफ्तार से पिघल रही है हर 10 सालों में करीब 12.2 पर की रफ्तार से ऑफिशियल साइंटिफिक रिकॉर्ड्स के हिसाब से अब इसी आर्कटिक सी आइस को पिघलने से रोकने के लिए एक डच स्टार्टअप है कॉल्ड आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस जिसके साइंटिस्ट एक ऐसा मेगा प्रोजेक्ट लॉन्च कर रहे हैं जो मार्स कॉलोनाइजेशन जितना ही बड़ा इनिशिएटिव होने वाला है वो इस 15.5 मिलियन स्क्वायर किलोमीटर यानी कि इतना बड़ा एरिया जिसमें पांच इंडिया जैसे देश समा सकते हैं इतने बड़े एरिया को रिफ्रीज करने जा रहे हैं विदन अ डेडलाइन ऑफ जस्ट सिक्स इयर्स और इसके लिए वो पूरे बर्फीले नॉर्थ पोल पर पैराडॉक्सिकली नमकीन पानी छिड़कने वाले अब जिन्हें नहीं पता उन्हें थोड़ा सा बैकग्राउंड दे दूं नमकीन पानी ट्रेडिशनल कॉल्ड एज ब्राइम सारे बर्फीले देश अपने रास्तों पर बर्फ जमने से रोकने के लिए छिड़क हैं क्योंकि जब बर्फ गिरती है तो वो इसी ब्राइंस जो चीज टिपिकली बर्फ को पिघला है उसी से ही ये साइंटिस्ट बर्फ को रिफ्रीज कैसे करने वाले हैं वेल ये अपने आप में ही काफी वियर्ड मगर फैसटिकट फिलहाल इस प्रोजेक्ट के जरा स्केल के बारे में सोच कर देखो यह प्रोजेक्ट कितना मैसिव होने वाला है यहां पर हम सिर्फ हमारे हिमालय में मौजूद ग्लेशियर्स को ही फ्रोजन नहीं रख पाते जिस वजह से जगह-जगह पर बाढ़ आ जाती है तबाही मचती है लोग मरते हैं और वहां पर साइंटिस्ट लिटरली पांच भारत जितने एरिया को फ्रीज करने जा रहे हैं सो नेचुरली यहां पर यह सवाल पैदा होता है कि यार ये इतने बड़े सीमिंगली इंपॉसिबल प्रोजेक्ट को करने की आखिर जरूरत ही क्यों पड़ रही है आई मीन दुनिया के किसी कोने में यह आर्कटिक पड़ता है वहां पर जो कुछ भी हो रहा है उससे हमें क्या ही फर्क पड़ रहा होगा राइट एंड वेल यहीं पर हम सब गलत हो जाते हैं व्हेन आई सेड इन साइंटिस्ट ने अगले 6 सालों की डेडलाइन रखी हुई है अपने ऊपर वेल एक्चुअली में ये डेडलाइन उन्होंने खुद डिसाइड नहीं की है बल्कि यह प्रकृति ने हमारे लिए डिसाइड कि है क्योंकि अकॉर्डिंग टू मोस्ट रिसेंट एस्टिमेट्स अगले छ सालों में मोर स्पेसिफिकली सितंबर 2013 तक हमें पहली बार एक ऐसा समर देखने को मिलेगा जिसमें आर्कटिक सी आइस पूरी तरीके से मेल्ट हो चुका होगा एंड यू नो व्हाट्स वर्स अगर ऐसा हुआ तो नासा साइंटिस्ट क्रिस्टीना पिस्टोन का कहना है कि अगले 25 सालों में हम जितना कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड इमिट करेंगे और उससे जितनी ज्यादा गर्मी बढ़ेगी उतनी गर्मी 2030 के बाद तुरंत एक झटके में बढ़ जाएगी उन्होंने इसे ऑफिशियल सैटेलाइट इमेजिंग पैटर्स के जरिए डिस्कवर किया है जिसका रिकॉर्ड आप स्क्रीन पर देख सकते हो अब ऐसे में इस साल की गर्मी तो तो आपको याद ही होगी 50 डिग्री टच हो गया था अकेले मार्च से म के बीच में ऑल ओवर इंडिया करीब 25000 लोगों को हॉस्पिटलाइज करना पड़ा जिनमें से 56 लोग मारे भी गए सिर्फ इस गर्मी के कारण इनफैक्ट इंडिया क्यू ऐसे सिमिलर ट्रेंड्स पूरे दुनिया भर में देखे गए 2014 से 2023 ये हमारे इंसानी इतिहास के 10 सबसे गर्म साल रहे जिसमें से पिछला ही साल 2023 ऑन रेकॉर्ड वाज द हॉटेस्ट ईयर एवर इतनी गर्मी नहीं पड़ती पर जितनी गर्मी आज है इतनी गर्मी मैंने अभी तक लाइफ में बता रहा हूं इतनी गर्मी मैंने झेला नहीं है आल्सो दुनिया में कुछ ऐसे कोस्टल सिटीज और गांव भी है जो समुंदर के नीचे डूब रहे जैसे कि इंडोनेशिया के इन गांवों को देखो इंडोनेशिया के जावा आइलैंड के नॉर्दर्न कोस्ट पर बसे ये गांव अभी 2005 से पहले ही पूरी तरह से सूखे हुए करते थे बट आज हालत ऐसी हो गई है कि वहां पर बच्चों को तैर के स्कूल जाना पड़ रहा है और माएं लो टाइट का इंतजार करती है घर के काम करने के लिए देन सेम घटना थाईलैंड की कैपिटल सिटी बैंकॉक के साथ भी घट रही है ये सब समुंदर के बीच में जो पोल्स आप देख रहे हो ना ये इलेक्ट्रिसिटी के पोल्स है क्योंकि वहां आज से कुछ दशक पहले एक गांव हुआ करता था दुनिया भर में ऐसे कई-कई और शहर है जैसे कि नेदर ैंसली का फेमस वेनिश शहर यूएसए के न्यू ऑरलियंस वर्जीनिया बीच वाले इलाके नाइजीरिया का लागो शहर बांग्लादेश का कैपिटल धाका एंड लास्ट बट नॉट द लीस्ट इवन हमारा फाइनेंशियल कैपिटल मुंबई ये वो शहर है जहां पर सी लेवल तेजी से राइज हो रहा है और ये साल प्रति साल डूबते चले जा रहे हैं और आर्कटिक आइस के पूरी तरह तरह से पिघलने के बाद इनमें से एटलीस्ट कुछ शहरों को तो हम खुद अपनी आंखों से सामने गायब होते हुए देखेंगे यानी कि आर्कटिक सी आइस को बचाना हमारे लिए करो या मरो वाली सिचुएशन हो गई है और अगर अब हमने कुछ नहीं किया तो यह इकलौता प्लानेट जिस पर जीव रह पाते हैं ये भी जीवन के लिए एक लिविंग हिल बन जाएगा सो आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस के साइंटिस्ट इसे रोकने के लिए क्या कर रहे हैं क्या वो समय रहते पांच इंडिया जितने बड़े एरिया में फैले आर्कटिक सी आइस को फिर से रिफ्रीज कर पाएंगे वेल इसका जवाब एक्चुअली में काफी इंटरेस्टिंग है लेकिन उसके बारे में डिस्कस करने से पहले इसका जो रूट प्रॉब्लम है यानी कि ग्लोबल वार्मिंग की वजह से जो सनलाइट इतनी इंटेंस हो रही है और गर्मी बढ़ रही है इससे पर्सनली मुझे बहुत दिक्कत हो रही है आई एम श्यर आपको भी हो रही होगी देखो आपको तो पता ही होगा हमारे प्रोफेशन में लुक्स का भी एक बहुत बड़ा रोल होता है सो शूट से पहले मैं हमेशा अपने घर से बाल सेट करके तो निकलता हूं लेकिन गर्मी और ह्यूमिडिटी इतनी है कि सेट पहुंचने से पहले ही बाल खराब हो जाते हैं अब यस हेयर वैक्स जरूर लगा सकते हैं लेकिन क्योंकि इसमें केमिकल्स होते हैं मैं पर्सनली इसे अवॉइड करता था अंटच्ड हेयर वैक्स ये नेचुरल आर्गन ऑयल से बना हुआ हेयर वैक्स है जिसमें कोई हार्मफुल केमिकल्स नहीं है प्लस ये नॉन स्टिकी और एंटी डैंड्रफ भी है इससे मैं अपने बाल कैसे भी सेट करूं ठ घंटों तक ये हेयर को होल्ड करके रखता है सो बाल बिखरने का कोई टेंशन नहीं और इसीलिए ये एवरीडे यूज के लिए एकदम परफेक्ट है और सबसे इंपोर्टेंट बात अगर आप मेरे डिस्क्रिप्शन लिंक से इस प्रोडक्ट को परचेस करते हो तो पहले 200 कस्टमर्स के लिए ये प्र प्रोडक्ट एब्सलूट फ्री है सो डेफिनेटली चेक आउट ट्रू हेयर एंड स्किन नेचुरल हेयर वैक्स लिंक इज इन द डिस्क्रिप्शन एंड नाउ लेट्स जंप बैक टू द टॉपिक एंड डिस्कस क्या साइंटिस्ट समय रहते पांच इंडिया जितने बड़े एरिया में फैले हुए आर्कटिक रीजन के सी आइस को फिर से रिफ्रीज कर पाएंगे कि नहीं वेल इस मार्स कॉलोनाइजेशन जितने मुश्किल मेगा प्रोजेक्ट को अंजाम देने के लिए आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस के साइंटिस्ट ने एक काफी जीनियस स्ट्रेटेजी ढूंढ निकाली है जिससे कम से कम खर्च और मेहनत में हम ज्यादा से ज्यादा आर्कटिक को फिर से रिफ्रीज कर पाएंगे ये स्ट्रेटेजी इनफैक्ट इतनी कारगर साबित हो रही है कि इवन यूनाइटेड नेशंस ने इनके काम से खुश होकर इस नए नवेले स्टार्टअप को पूरी दुनिया की तरफ से आर्कटिक सी आइस रेस्टोरेशन प्रोजेक्ट का लीडर चुन लिया है दरअसल हमारे नॉर्थ पोल्स के पास एक जगह है कॉल्ड स्वल बार्ड आर्किपेलागो ये नॉर्वे के अंडर आता है एंड इट इज वन ऑफ द फास्टेस्ट वार्मिंग प्लेसेस ऑन दी प्लानेट जो साल दर साल हमारे पृथ्वी के एवरेज टेंपरेचर से भी करीब तीन गुना तेजी से गर्म हो रहा है सो आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस ने यहां पर क्या किया ये अपने छोटे डीजल पर चलने वाले वाटर पंप्स लेकर स्वल बार्ड पहुंच गए और उस पंप की मदद से वहां पर बर्फ के नीचे मौजूद आर्कटिक ओशन के खारे पानी को ऊपर स्प्रे करने लग गए ताकि वो पानी ऊपर की ठंडी हवा से फ्रीज होकर ऑलरेडी एसिस्टिंग बर्फ पर एक एक्स्ट्रा लेयर बनाए बेसिकली आपने देखा होगा हिस्ट्री टीवी पर एक शो आया करता था कॉल्ड आइस रोड ट्रकर्स जिसमें कनाडा और अलास्का के ट्रकर्स को थंड में जमी रिवर्स और लेक्स पर बड़े-बड़े ट्रेलर्स चलाते हुए फिल्म किया जाता था वेल उसमें वो जो फ्रोजन रिवर्स दिखाए जाते थे ना वो भी हर साल इसी टेक्निक का इस्तेमाल करके फ्रीज किए जाते हैं पर यहां पर आता है एक कैच अगर आपको याद होगा तो मैंने शुरुआत में कहा था कि कई सारे देश हैं जो स्नोफॉल से पहले अपने रास्तों पर नमकीन पानी छिड़क हैं ताकि रास्तों पर बर्फ ना जमे सो क्या आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस का प्लान बैकफायर नहीं होगा क्या हम आर्कटिक सी को रिफ्रीज करने के बजाय उसे और मेल्ट नहीं कर देंगे वेल ये डाउट ना टोटली वैलिड है और इसीलिए कनाडा और अलास्का में बर्फ के ऊपर फ्रेश वाटर पंप किया जाता है ब्राइक सॉल्ट वाटर नहीं लेकिन आर्कटिक में हम सॉल्ट वाटर भी इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं क्योंकि वहां पर सॉल्ट वाटर भी फ्रेश वाटर की तरह ही काम करता है लेट मी एक्सप्लेन यू हाउ सो जब हम पानी में नमक यानी कि और यही वजह है कि फ्रेश वाटर जहां पर 0 डिग्री सेल्सियस पर फ्रीज होता है लेकिन सी वाटर ऑन दी अदर हैंड ऑन एन एवरेज अराउंड -20 डि सेल्सियस के टेंपरेचर में फ्रीज होता है सो अब आर्कटिक में सॉल्ट वाटर फ्रेश वाटर की तरह आखिर कैसे काम करता है सिंपल फ्रेश वाटर हो या सी वाटर आर्कटिक का टेंपरेचर तो - 40° सेल्सियस होता है ना इतने थंड में दोनों ही फ्रीज हो जाते हैं और इसीलिए वहां पर खारा सी वाटर आर्कटिक आइस को मेल्ट नहीं करेगा प्लस इसके साथ इसके अन्य फायदे भी तो है आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस का ये वाटर पंप देखो ये कितना पोर्टेबल है यट कितना पावरफुल ऐसे पंप्स को पूरे आर्कटिक आइस पर जगह जगह पर फिट करना कंपेरटिवली मच इजियर है देन पूरे आर्कटिक को रिफ्लेक्टिव ग्लास बीड्स या वाइट फैब्रिक से कवर करना सनलाइट को रिफ्लेक्ट करने के लिए जैसे कि प्रीवियस स्टडीज ने सजेस्ट किया था आल्सो या आर्कटिक रिफ्लेक्शंस को इस बात का एहसास जरूर है कि इन पंप्स को फिलहाल तो फ्यूल लगता है जो कि कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड एमिशंस करके पैराडॉक्सिकली आइस मेल्टिंग में ही कंट्रीब्यूट करता है और इसीलिए वो इनिशियल ट्रायल्स के बाद नॉर्थ पोल पर विंड फार्म्स लगाने वाले ताकि उन पंप्स को ग्रीन एनर्जी के मदद से चलाया जाए बट फ्रेंड्स एज विद एनी ग्लोबल एनवायरमेंटल इनिशिएटिव इस इतने नोबल इनिशिएटिव को तक क्रिटिसिजम मिल रहे हैं इसे अननेसेसरी हाइप बता करर या फिर इसके थ्रेट को डाउन प्ले करवाकर लेट मी टे यू फस बा ग्लोबल वार्मिंग डों व अब कई लोग तो आज भी ऐसा मानते हैं और आपने भी यह कई कई बार सुना होगा कि ग्लोबल वार्मिंग तो बस एक होस है हमारी पृथ्वी नेचुरली भी हर कुछ हजार सालों में आइस एजेस और गर्म फेजेस से गुजरती है नेचुरल साइकल्स को डिसर पट करने में हमारा हम ह्यूमंस का कोई भी कंट्रीब्यूशन नहीं है सो वेल इन बातों के पीछे की सच्चाई आखिर क्या है साइंस क्या कहता है सो वेल टू आंसर दिस सबसे पहले तो यह समझो कि ये सोच आखिर पैदा ही कहां से होती है और फिर बाकी के चीजें अपने आप ही सेंस बनाने लगी देखो साल 1850 में ना जब पहली बार हमने ग्लोबल टेंपरेचर डटा रिकॉर्ड करना शुरू किया था तब पृथ्वी का एवरेज ग्लोब ग्लोबल टेंपरेचर 13.7 डिग्री सेल्सियस हुआ करता था लेकिन उसके बाद जब से यूरोपिय ने इंडस्ट्रीज लगाना शुरू किया कंस्ट्रक्शन करना मोटर इंजंस बनाना तो पृथ्वी का एवरेज टेंपरेचर हर 10 सालों में 0.06 डि से बढ़ने लगा और 1982 के बाद जब इंडस्ट्रियल इजेशन और तेजी से बढ़ा चाइना जापान और साउथ कोरिया जैसे देश भी इसमें कूद पड़े तो अब एवरेज ग्लोबल टेंपरेचर हर 10 सालों में2 डिग्री सेल्सियस यानी कि तीन गुने ज्यादा तेजी से बढ़ने लग गया अब यहां पर ना दो मेजर लूप होल्स है या कह सकते हैं छलावा हैं पहला तो यह कि आज का करंट ग्लोबल एवरेज टेंपरेचर है 15.8 डिग्री सेल्सियस तो कई लोगों को ऐसा लगता है कि पृथ्वी ओवरऑल काफी कूल है एंड सेकंड 1850 से लेकर अब तक सिर्फ 1.35 डिग्री सेल्सियस का ही तो टेंपरेचर राइज हुआ है जो कि सुनने में इतना बड़ा जंप नहीं लगता और एगजैक्टली यहीं पर लोग सिचुएशन की गंभीरता को नजरअंदाज कर जाते हैं और ग्लोबल वार्मिंग को एक हाइप या फिर एक हक्स बुला देते हैं वो ये नहीं समझते कि व्हेन वी से एवरेज ग्लोबल टेंपरेचर वो पोल्स की थंड से लेकर इक्वेटर की गर्मी तक का एक एवरेज टेंपरेचर होता है सो अगर ये एवरेज सिर्फ 1 डिग्री से भी बढ़ रहा है तो इसका मतलब होता है कि जो गर्मी वाली साइड है वहां का तापमान एक अच्छे खासे मार्जिन से बढ़ रहा है प्लस हमारी पृथ्वी एक कॉम्प्लिकेटेड इकोसिस्टम है जिसमें कई कॉम्प्लेक्शन टेंपरेचर का होना जरूरी है जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल हमारा बॉडी टेंपरेचर होता है अराउंड 37 डिग्री सेल्सियस अगर हमारा टेंपरेचर इससे 1 डिग्री भी बढ़ जाता है तो हम उसे फीवर कहते हैं और ये एक साइन होता है कि शरीर में कुछ गड़बड़ी हो रही है जबकि सिर्फ एक ही तो डिग्री बढ़ा है ना पृथ्वी के केस में भी बिल्कुल ऐसा ही होता है सिर्फ 1 डिग्री से भी अगर ग्लोबल एवरेज टेंपरेचर राइज होता है तो ये एक अनहेल्दी इकोसिस्टम क्रिएट करता है जो एक कैस्केड ऑफ इवेंट्स को ट्रिगर करता है जिससे और तेजी से फिर टेंपरेचर राइज होने लगता है जो सिलसिला चलता रहेगा जब तक सारी बर्फ पिघल ना जाए और प्रलय ना आ जाए एंड लेट मी प्रूव दिस टू यू कि ये कैसे होता है इसे ध्यान से समझना और नेक्स्ट टाइम अगर आपको कोई भी बोले कि ग्लोबल वार्मिंग एक हक्स है तो इन फैक्ट से उनकी बोलती बंद करना देखो हमारी पृथ्वी को हर समय सूरज से करीब 342 वाट्स पर मीटर स्क्वा जितनी एनर्जी मिलती है लेकिन जो वाइट क्लाउड्स है वाइट स्नो है और बाकी रिफ्लेक्टिव सरफेस है वो इसमें से करीब 107 वाट्स पर मीटर स्क्वा एनर्जी वापस रिफ्लेक्ट कर देते हैं और तभी जाकर हमारा ग्लोबल एवरेज सालों साल काफी स्टेडी रहता है अब यहां पर प्रॉब्लम यह है कि सारे ग्रीन हाउस गैसेस मिलके टोटल 2.6 यूनिट्स सोलर एनर्जी एक्स्ट्रा एब्जॉर्ब करते हैं दन यूजुअल और ये टेक्निकली सिर्फ 1.1 पर ज्यादा एनर्जी अब्जॉर्प्शन है लेकिन व्हाट पीपल डोंट अंडरस्टैंड इज दैट इवन 1 पर भी अगर एनर्जी एब्जॉर्ब अब्जॉर्प्शन बढ़ गया तो टोटल एनर्जी एब्जॉर्ब 3 पर बढ़ जाता है क्योंकि जब ग्लोबल वार्मिंग बढ़ती है तो उससे सिर्फ पोल्स ही नहीं पिघलते उससे एक पूरा चेन रिएक्शन ट्रिगर होता है जो इस पृथ्वी के हर एक जीव को इफेक्ट करता है सबसे पहले तो पोलर आइज कैप्स मेल्ट होने लगते हैं तो नेचुरली वाइट स्नो नहीं रहेगा टू रिफ्लेक्ट द सनलाइट तो सनलाइट ज्यादा रिफ्लेक्ट नहीं होगी तो समुंद्र का पानी ज्यादा इवेपरेट होने लगेगा और ज्यादा भाव बनने लगेगा जो भी एक ग्रीन हाउस गैस है प्लस हमारे पोलर आइज कैप्स एक तरह से एक ढक्कन का भी काम करते हैं जो जमीन की गहराइयों में ट्रैप्ड मीथेन को लीक होने से रोकते हैं अभी स्वॉल बाड का ही बताया जा रहा है कि अकेला स्वॉल बार्ड भी अगर पूरी तरह से पिघल गया तो वह हर साल एटलीस्ट 2310 टंस ऑफ मीथेन हर साल एटमॉस्फियर में लीक करेगा और मीथेन अगेन ठहरा एक डेडली ग्रीन हाउस गैस जो और ग्लोबल वार्मिंग क्रिएट करेगा जिससे और आइस कैप्स मेल्ट होंगे और ट्रैप्ड ग्रीनहाउस गैसेस रिलीज होंगे और यह परपे चुअल साइकिल चलता रहेगा इसके बाद जब ओशनस तपते हैं तो कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड भी उसमें डिजॉल्वेशन वो एटमॉस्फियर में फ्लोट होने लगता है व्हिच ट्रिगर्स इवन मोर ग्लोबल वार्मिंग एंड लास्टली अनदर मैकेनिज्म दैट एक्ट्स एज अ पोटेंशियल ट्रिगर जब गर्मी बढ़ती है तो जगह-जगह ड्राउंस यानी कि सूखा पड़ जाता है और उससे फॉरेस्ट फायर्स ट्रिगर होते हैं जिससे वंस अगेन ग्रीन हाउस गैसेस रिलीज होते हैं और तापमान और भी ज्यादा बढ़ जाता है सो अब इसमें इंसानों की गलती कहां पे आती है वेल आप ये डाटा देखो वो जो 2.6 यूनिट्स एनर्जी ज्यादा एब्जॉर्ब हो रही है ना ग्रीन हाउस गैसेस की वजह से उसमें क्लियर सबसे ज्यादा कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड रोल प्ले करता है एंड गेस व्हाट सम हाउ 1980 के बाद से यानी कि जब इंडस्ट्रियल इजेशन दुनिया भर में तेज हुआ उसी के बाद से कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड वातावरण में ड्रास्ट्रिंग इंसानों से हटाकर प्रकृति के नेचुरल प्रोसेसेस जिसकी वोल्कानिक इरप्शन वगैरह पर डालते हैं क्या वो यह कहना चाहते हैं कि जब 1980 में इंडस्ट्रियल इजेशन तेज हुआ एगजैक्टली उसी पॉइंट से नेचुरल कैलेमिटीज जैसे वोल्कानिक इरप्शन भी ज्यादा बढ़ गए क्या ये कुछ बहुत ही ज्यादा बड़ा कोइंसिडेंस नहीं हो गया और अगर ऐसा सच में है तो शायद इन्हीं नेचुरल एक्टिविटीज का ह्यूमन एक्टिविटीज के साथ ही कुछ को रिलेशन है और ऐसे में इन साइंटिस्ट का ये मेगा इनिशिएटिव टू रिफ्रीज आर्कटिक लाइफ सेविंग साबित हो सकता है अगर आपको यह वीडियो अच्छा लगा इससे कुछ भी नया सीखने मिला एक लाइक जरूर ठोकना इस वीडियो को जितना हो सके शेयर करो अपने फ्रेंड्स और फैमिली मेंबर्स के साथ ताकि उन तक भी ये अवेयरनेस फैले और

You know what that means! Hello and welcome to No Effort November, a series of videos for the month of November in which no effort is made. Are you a prude who can’t bear the thought of your children being exposed to naughty language in movies and television, but you just can’t bear the thought of missing out on watching stuff as a family? Are you looking for a technological solution to free you from the guilt of exposing your kids to bad words? Is it 1998? Well then have I got the solution for you, the TV Guardian. This amazing device attaches to any ordinary television set and transforms that foul-mouthed boob tube into a proper G-rated gentleman. Mostly. How does it work? State-of-the-art technology, of course! The TV Guardian filters out foul language from cable or satellite TV
AND home video sources like VHS tapes, DVDs, and let’s not forget Laserdiscs. Simply disconnect the video source from your TV and connect it to the Guardian. Then, connect the Guardian to your TV and now you can watch TV as a family without worrying about an F-bomb absolutely ruining your night. How does it work? State-of-the-art technology, of course! Didn’t I just say that? Uh, let’s begin with a look at this gadget. The device itself is pretty simple, with two complete sets of composite video and audio jacks - which are helpfully labeled Right, Left, and Video, but you’ll have to guess which one is the input and which one’s the output. There’s also a coaxial RF out for old-school TV sets and another RF connection above it which is… unlabeled. There’s a DC barrel plug for power input, which they did 
bother to specify as 9v, 100ma DC, but forgot to finish the diagram for plug polarity. Helpful! We also find two three-position switches for changing settings. We’ll get back to those. Lastly, there is one more switch tucked way behind a hole at the top of this panel which is once again unlabeled. They did a bang-up job here. That’s the channel 3 or 4 selector for the RF modulator, 
which you’d know if you bothered to read the manual. Now I know that this was likely a fairly low-volume product,   and it’s also 20+ years old, but the cheapness of the construction here cannot be stressed enough. This looks and feels like an electronics project box, and frankly if it weren’t for the TV guardian branding I’d think it 
literally was an off-the-shelf electronics project box. Of course there is a custom circuit board in here… [feigning sadness]
oh no, I voided my warranty but yeah even this is pretty basic. Just a few chips and an off-the-shelf modulator, essentially. That’s because this is using much of the same componentry you’d find in all sorts of contemporary video equipment. It’s just got a bit of a trick up its sleeve. The device uses our old friend closed captioning to watch out for profamity. Since I already made a video on that topic I won’t go deep into it here. Plus it is November. But in the US, starting in the 1980’s television broadcasts and home video formats
began regularly incorporating closed captioning in the form of a hidden data stream across the length of
Line 21 in the analog video signal. Line 21 is near the end of the vertical blanking interval, which is a string of blank lines that help an analog television draw the image. While you’re not supposed to be able to see it, in the digital age we’re starting to find parts of it pop out occasionally, like here in Frasier. These blinky dashes are encoding text and basic 
formatting, and they get extracted as high-low pulses by a television set, or a separate device, and decoded to generate text atop the image. This was a way to add captioning for those who desired 
it without making it part of the broadcast image, hence the name closed captioning. Now, an older analog television like this one, mindlessly drawing glowing lines
on the face of a cathode ray tube over and over again, doesn’t process what it’s doing and this picture tube actually 
draws the lines, blinky dashes and everything. But they’re getting drawn outside the visible area, somewhere like here. That’s thanks to overscan:
the actual image is blown out just a bit beyond the edges of the screen which was necessary due to the vagaries of analog video and since most picture tubes didn’t have perfectly rectangular faces. So you weren’t ever gonna see this datastream unless there was 
something wrong with your television set. But modern displays what with their neat 
grids of pixels and discrete resolutions   generally don’t stretch the image they 
are told to display beyond their borders.   Some do for silly reasons which makes using 
them as a computer monitor very annoying until you find the “just scan” setting buried in the menus but... for the most part, a modern display or television will show the entirety
of whatever you throw at it. And some less-than-careful analog-to-digital transfers
have gotten done over the years, which captured part of the vertical blanking interval. That’s what’s happening in this episode of Frasier. Whoever did the transfer didn’t take care to ensure the 480 rows of pixels they’d capture from the 525 lines of video started at, like, line 23 or 24. Or perhaps they just thought overscan was gonna live on forever. Anyway, back to the TV Guardian. Baked into its programming is a dictionary of offensive words and phrases which, for science, I’d love to see but it’s not written anywhere in the manual, aw shucks. Now, when it’s turned on and active, 
it decodes the captioning data from line 21. If it finds a match with one of those 
objectionable things in its dictionary, the guardian jumps into action and… mutes the audio to protect the innocent. That… that’s what it does. Now, I may sound like I’m making fun of this little gadget. And I must admit that this particular form of parental control
 seems a bit… odd to my ears, but the way it’s done is actually pretty clever. Here, let’s all settle down as a wholesome 
family and watch Goodfellas together with the Guardian turned on. Profanity is definitely the only objectionable part of that movie, right? [ambient road noise] So far it looks like a typical movie-going experience,
but watch what happens here. [clunky thud, ambient noise] [audio cuts out] [Jimmy - What's up? Did I hear something? What the F - ]
[audio cuts again] Not only was the audio muted, but when that happened the closed captioning was placed on-screen so it can be read and stand in for the missing dialogue. And that captioning was altered to remove the offensive word, in this case ""fudge."" But it didn’t simply remove the word, it also took out the the. “What the fudge is that” became, simply, This sort of word swap or rephrasing is done whenever necessary. And it’s sometimes pretty good at keeping the 
context intact. Like, for instance in this scene. [ How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and - ] [audio cut] [sound returns] Good government “bull excrement” was replaced 
with good government ""baloney."" [ For us, to live any other way was nuts. T - ] Here, the line “to us, those goody good people who work 'shirty' jobs”
got turned into “who work crud jobs”. Cruddy would have been a better fit but still, not bad. As much as this is clever, it’s really doing this because of a limitation stemming from how the captions work. Captioning data is sent in spurts which encode all the text to be displayed on screen - and where to place it. Entire sentences are often displayed at once, in fact a call and response between two characters is sometimes on screen. The text will stay there until the next spurt of data is received which either contains more text and formatting or says to clear it. So, if a chunk of captioning data contains a bad word or phrase, the TV Guardian knows it will be spoken at some point the text is displayed, but it doesn’t know exactly when. So the only thing it can do is mute the audio for the entire 
time that caption block appears on the screen. [Partner. Is that what you've been trying to tell me, you want me to be part - ] [audio cut] [It's not even fair, no?] As removing an entire sentence or more could 
very easily cause you to lose the plot,   it has little choice but to display the 
text with the objectionable parts altered. Now that is an optional feature. One of the two option switches we haven’t talked about yet is labeled ""caption,"" and you can choose between On, Cuss, and Off. So far we’ve seen it in the cuss setting, but if you like, you can move 
the switch to “off” — using a tiny screwdriver or something because they’re recessed in a way which I can’t decide if was deliberate for parental control reasons or just bad design — and that will simply have it mute the audio
and leave you wondering what was said. I don’t know why you’d want that but you can do it! You can also have it leave captions on continuously, 
leaving nice and friendly phrases unaltered but, whenever someone uses a mouth which makes 
you wonder if they kiss their mother with it, it’ll cut the audio out and make whatever 
alterations to the written dialogue it sees fit. You can also choose how strict you want the filtering to be.   If phrases like “My god” bother you,
you’ll want the extra strict enforcement turned on. But if you’re just a little bit more lenient, you can choose the mild setting which lets such religious-adjacent phrases through, in addition to less-objectionable potty-mouth words. Now these are printed in the manual. I won’t read them all off but it includes such bangers as
balls, wuss, up yours, forms of screw, and even ""H E Double Hockey Sticks."" And if you only care that your children don’t hear these words
but you yourself are in for a good profanity-laden evening, you can also turn off the filtering altogether. Now, it’s probably obvious but this method has a few key weaknesses. We’ve already discussed how it has to mute entire sentences or more but, to reiterate, it has to mute entire sentences or more. And its decisions on how to fill in what it 
censors are good most of the time but can also be… really weird or even just bad. Here’s a list of all the examples that I’ve found. I’ll try to keep this family friendly, folks but you might not agree 
with all my decisions here so just be warned. We already established that ""excrement"" turns into crud, but if it’s phrased as “oh, shirt” then it becomes “oh, man.” Pretty good. The phrase that rhymes with ""missed off"" gets changed to teed off (or just teed). Prick becomes jerk. Bastard also turns into jerk. Uh… ""rocksucker"" was also turned into jerk. Really there’s a lotta jerks. But slut, ah well that turned into flirt. It’s fine with moron. That’s cool with the guardian. The n word simply becomes ellipses which… yeah that’s probably for the best. A word now commonly considered a slur became simply “gay” so the caption “he’s treating me like a gay” popped up here. Interesting. And then on the strict setting, balls gets turned into tail, which is funny because that word can also just mean… balls or be a name as happened here. Oh, and the exclamation ""My God"" becomes Man, which… I guess that’s fine. But then there’s the F-bomb. As any sailor mouth knows that particular word can mean many things
and results to censor it will vary. Here’s a decent example. ""Maybe it’s me, I’m a little forked up."" turns into ""Maybe it’s me, I’m a little 'messed' up."" Great work! That worked fine. And it did a pretty good job earlier when it removed the the in
""what the fudge is that?"" But, uh, if it’s ever phrased as a verb, the guardian likes to change it to ""wow."" Like, you'll wow everything up.
Or, go wow yourself. I mean, OK. Uh, if it see’s “fork’n” the word just gets removed
and an errant apostrophe is left behind. And it appears to change some instances to “go away”
which makes sense for “fork off” I guess but, ""go go away your mother"" doesn’t really mean anything intelligible. That’s a total fail. Oh and, F... trucker is another word that becomes jerk. But even if it made perfect decisions all the time,   it first relies on closed captioning to be 
A) there in the first place B) accurate and not itself censored and C) properly timed and in sync with the speech. By the time this thing was released most everything had closed captions in it, but with the rise of the DVD, some studios went rogue. And in fact, the manual calls out Universal for doing this. See, DVD players are capable of injecting their own line 21 captioning data so analog TVs hooked up to them can decode it on their own. Here’s an example with The Birdcage, another film which I’m sure in the eyes of a TV Guardian buyer would be completely unobjectionable if only it didn’t have cuss words. But of course, DVD players could also display closed captions themselves. And far more capably, offering captions in multiple languages, 
commentary tracks, and in any style, font, or color the publisher desired. Universal, it seems, deemed the newfound capabilities of DVD enough to negate the need for old-fashioned line 21 caption support in their releases, at least circa 2000. So for Universal's DVDs the Guardian has no idea what’s being said,
and it’s f-bombs galore. Another issue comes from captions which don’t exactly match the dialog.   This is actually quite common, usually when dialog is fast-paced. [ It was there that I knew that I belonged. To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They weren't like anybody else. I mean, they did whatever they wanted. They double parked in front of a hydrant
and nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer, when they played cards all night,
nobody ever called the cops.] For instance, in Goodfellas, the Guardian correctly catches that terrible version of “ticked” when Henry’s narration says “my father was always ticked off,” but just after this Henry repeats “he was ticked” at the beginning of
three separate phrases in something of a run-on sentence. The captioning is structured more loosely, though, with the offending word only placed in the beginning of that sentence. So the audio is unmuted and the last one is… missed. [ ... was in a wheelchair, he was pissed
that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house] Won’t somebody think of the children? Then of course, what if whoever wrote the captions 
was a prude who censored them? Instead of actually writing out H E Double Hockey Sticks they could have written ""H asterisk asterisk asteroid."" Now, doing that is very bad captioning practice - after all,
if adults are choosing to see a movie with profanity and rely on captions, they’re not seeing the movie they chose to see if the captions are censored. So in the grand scheme that should be rare. But oh the sweet irony of a prudish transcription causing 
profanity to slip through the TV Guardian. Lastly, there’s caption timing. Live events rely on stenographers furiously stenographering what’s spoken and that leads to a substantial delay in the captions. So better hope those sportscasters aren’t potty mouths. Scripted content is generally better, but it’s not perfect. The Guardian let quite a few things slip through in Goodfellas. To be fair, they don’t claim perfection on the box. Another somewhat odd choice was an inability to censor any RF source. There is a coaxial input but this is just a pass-through, and as a matter-of-fact this shipped with a red cover over the top connection and there’s a note in the manual that basically says “don’t use this.” Yes, it has a built-in RF modulator for outputting to older TVs, but the censoring function only works on the composite input. So if you want this to work with live TV,
you’ll either need to have satellite or cable, or you’ll need to use your VCRs TV tuner for over-the-air broadcasts from now on and hope your kids don’t figure that part out.   I imagine this was mainly a cost-cutting measure but it still seems silly. Oh, and since there’s only one input… well that gets fun when you have a cable box, a VCR, and a DVD player and you'd like them all to be Guardianed. Better hope your VCR is fancy enough to have two inputs, and then you can run everything through it. But if you’re not so lucky, you’ll need some sort of video switcher. The manual even says as much. The limitations we just went over are all technical ones, though. There’s also a pretty glaring conceptual hurdle. I chose Goodfellas and The Birdcage to demonstrate this because I have a feeling the sort of person who bought the TV Guardian might object to some of the visuals and themes in those films. Just a hunch. The TV Guardian can’t do anything about the content or what’s on the screen; it can only ever be a pretty-good but not perfect profanity 
filter. So I’m somewhat perplexed by the perceived value here. You’re still gonna need to screen for 
whatever you might not want your kids… seeing! I suppose there’s a lot of content out there which is otherwise pretty tame but which has a few sailor mouth moments. But it’s really only that middle-ground that this can do anything for. And if I may be so bold, if you’re that worried
about your kids hearing the occasional bad word,   well you better not let them leave the house. That was a joke, just wanna be clear, but yeah - there’s a lot of profanity outside of television, hate to break it to you. Still, though, as much as I think 
this is silly and not at all for me,  I will tip my hat to it for being pretty clever. And, if you think there’s some merit in this idea, or maybe you know someone in your life who would 
have loved one of these, well I have good news! This company still exists, and they make HDMI 
versions now so you can guard your Netflix. Except, not actually. Yeah, they’re  still relying on line 21 captions. Probably because HDMI doesn’t actually carry captioning data. The website makes it pretty clear that whatever you’re plugging into the new versions of this stills needs to have a composite video output for it to work,   so the HDMI video feed is… I guess just a passthrough that it draws captions on top of? I dunno, I’d investigate further but this is No Effort November. Before I go, I want to do two more things. First, I want to thank my long-time patron Colin for sending this thing to me. It’s very much not either of our jams, but it certainly is an intriguing use of closed captioning. And second… well I think it’s time I finally rip the band aid off about a certain video topic I promised. In my video on closed captioning, I said I’d be making a video on Teletext. And I said I'd do that “Soon” That was almost four years ago. So what happened? Well, I don’t think I’m the right person to tell that story. I’ve never used it, and as such I really have no enthusiasm or nostalgia for it. For those that don’t know, which is mainly people outside of Europe, teletext was an earlier and way, way, waaaaay more capable use of the vertical blanking interval for sending data along with television transmissions. And I cannot stress the way way wayyyyyy more capable part enough. It wasn’t just captions. It was full-on news, weather, sports information, trivia games,
and even computer programs all sent alongside ordinary television. For whatever reason, probably the lack 
of a nationalized television broadcaster,   that never got any traction here. Americans just don’t know what teletext is or was. We never had it aside from small-scale tests here and there. Those who live where teletext is common might be surprised
that our closed captions work just fine on VHS cassettes - see our standard was designed with that in mind. Teletext on the other hand is very high-bandwidth, and television sets couldn’t decode it from a consumer videotape. However, some really cool people have developed 
software techniques to recover the teletext information from home recordings, and archives are being built and expanded as we speak. That’s really interesting to me, but without a personal… connection to it, I just won’t give the story justice. I’ll leave that for someone else to tackle. I’ve put links to some info about Teletext and to the archive, if you're curious, down in the description. But yeah, a teletext video… isn’t gonna happen on this channel. I bet there are some pretty cool videos on YouTube right now, though - ohhh goodness. No. Nooo… Why are these popping up? They have nothing to do… OK, well if any of you out there have been holding off to make a video,
waiting for me to do something, you go right ahead - I’ll even be on the lookout for ‘em. And this one’s pretty good if you want to learn a bit about it right now. Ok bye. ♫ profanely smooth jazz ♫ Are you looking for a technological solution to your fear of nope. Are you a prude who can't bear the thought 
of your children being exposed to [runs out of air] oh god I didn't take a breath at the right time Of course there is a custom circuit breaker... circuit board. It's not a circuit breaker! Captioning data is sent in spurts which encode all the text tood ugh! Captioning data is sent in spurts which encode all the text to be displayed on - [laughs] That's a mouthful!

This is like Dietz Nuts all over again. It's not even supposed to be funny!

it goes out to the contestants and the way that it's weaved through on the inside determines how easy it is to pull so just to give you an idea of how important this is the Beast team originally set this mechanism up to require 32,000 Newtons of pulling Force but it's only as they started to play test it a few days before with a whole extra crew of play testers by the way let move in a little bit they realized 32,000 Newtons is going to take people way too long for the challenge to be fun to watch so just by weaving this rope through the Contraption in a slightly different way they could quickly lower the required pulling Force to just 10,000 oh and also this microphone here is sat there specifically to capture just the sound of effect of the Rope being pulled it's a little bit crazy just how many things you have to think about if you want to do this right even literally the flooring Jimmy decided that he wanted this place to look like a Coliseum so they pulled out every single bit of AstroTurf from it and then they've covered it with these Olive pits to basically give it that cinematic sand being thrown up ceiling when people are running around through it this is the Box camera we're using to adjudicate as soon as one of these Boulders cross the finish line that's the winner and so we'll be able to see from this camera which boulders and that team's eliminated didn't even occur to me that you need adjudication cameras we set our camera at the same height as this finish line so we can see exactly who won they're both at 80 ft so every single contestant also has an NFC wristband that they're scanning to keep track of who's in the game and who's out of the game when you're out they'll know that you need to go out too if you leave we're not leaving you're not leaving we're not leaving okay it took around 3 hours after revealing this first game before the thing actually kicked off partly to give the teams time to strategize partly because everything takes longer than you expect when you're trying to organize this many people ready wow this game genuinely lasted about 15 seconds in total and it was specifically designed to be that way oh my god that's literally it red team is done we just lost out on this chance to win $5 million we not Le I can't believe how quickly that happened Mr Beast wanted to make sure that the first game people saw was as easy to explain as possible and as quick to finish as possible not so much for the people here but more so that the viewers of the final video are able to get easily invested without feeling like they're suddenly having to learn something really complicated you can actually see people in that queue they're so defeated some of them are crying you know when you watch Mr Beast videos online and you think it can't be like that in real life the feeling is very much here I I love you too you all watch our videos love your videos oh my God Ricky Ricky you guys must feel like top of the world right now it was so nerve-wracking so nerve-wracking does that scare you like seeing what the other teams can do I can't be scared we're we're a part of History here well I'm rooting for you guys personally cuz you're fans yellow team you heard that yellow team yellow team yep I heard that all right yellow team for the win and now while we waited for game two to start now felt like as good a time as any to head to the main camera room to see the belly of the Beast and while the camera team were out actually filming the show who better to show us this room than Mr Tariq since the last time I saw you a lot has changed from the equipment to how we go about things to the lighting you've seen the scale of the projects has to be better and Jimmy's not as particular about the cameras anymore so he used to be really in the weeds with it now it's like I trust and I like it so these are just the ground cameras they'll be for talent they'll be just for close-ups on any of the contestants just like a grabb and go run and capture that moment this is very rigged up very rigged up yeah I noticed every single one of these cameras has a light on it darker images don't perform better retention wise at least is what we've learned and then we have the time code here it's just so we make sure everything is time coded ah yes the time code so they bought one of these devices to plug into every camera on this shoot for one job so whenever it goes to editing they know exactly what happened and when it happened so for example if somebody Falls and it's a really funny moment every single camera you could just search for that second and you'll have 100 viewpoints of that one shot almost 500 for this kid almost 500 I'm curious how the rig has evolved a lot heavier we have more stuff especially like tailored for editing better mic the signal just makes it easier to grab it and just get everything you need in one shot holding this for about 5 minutes I can see why there's an ex St ATT T oh yeah I mean you get some strong soldiers so that's the Run and Gun cameras there's 28 of those and they are pretty high spec totaling $100,000 in value the only one of these that's a tiny bit different is Mr be personal camera rig which has two lights on it instead of one to make him the brightest thing on screen so that your eyes are naturally drawn towards him there's a whole corner copia of lenses and they all have different purposes you guys use GoPros a lot but GoPros capture like a very different kind of shot to something like this is there a difference in what shots you use for what purpose emotional shots we try to do telephoto so we put somebody on the other side and just zoom in on their face as much as you can and then just kind of get that reaction you'll see a lot of the most vulnerable real moments on Mr be videos being captured like this because the camera is so far away that the contestant isn't spotting it and so isn't acting for it but that is far from the full Suite of camera G here there's 35 Sony fx9 Cinema cameras dotted all around the stadium to get the main wide fixed shots of the games there's 10 pan tilt Zoom or PTZ cameras which are also fixed in place but can be remotely operated to control what they're looking at 20 DJI Osmos for handing to the contestants to Vlog certain sequences since they are literally the easiest cameras to operate all rounded off with 400 I kid you not 400 GoPros they use these cuz they're small enough to fit inside of things and also just blend into the background so they don't appear in the rest of the camera's shots and that's not even factoring in all of the accessories like power banks for every single GoPro and also the proper Flagship camera gear like the Box cameras the sky cameras and the whole Army of drones but we are getting to that I noticed everyone's got delightful little nicknames for the different SE SE and so hot and cold for this battery section I assume hot means fully charged cold means empty yes it's exceptionally organized you can tell this is someone's job to create this pile absolutely Tariq then took us to Mac who is the lead editor of the Mr Beast team why he so tall man he's all dressed up he's tall and he pulls me out when I'm in my underwear and I'm all short sticks me right on camera I am not short that's all we came here for yeah and now that we' establish that Mac definitely isn't short I thought well Mr Beast videos are pretty much the most consistent highly viewed videos on the internet so given how involved Mac is especially in the intros of them how do these guys make sure that they perfectly capture your attention at the start the way we look at intros basically just like a continuation of the thumbnail most people don't have YouTube premium right and so they'll click on a video then they'll watch like a minute out or 5sec out and skip it whatever they do they will literally forget what they clicked on so what kind of things have you thought about with this video specifically the intro we were thinking about basically flying camera back instead of flying camera forward I want to see Jimmy's face I want to see the $5 million cash prize and I also want to communicate spect the other thing I thought was really interesting about the intro shot is they filmed it on two separate occasions across 6 hours of time giv that the intro is the single most important 10 seconds of the entire video these guys actually set up and recorded the full thing once before any contestants had even arrived when they have the time to make sure that they have one intro that they know works but then once again with all the contestants just in case that take ends up having better energy is there a shortage of shirts I just keep ripping them I'm not the is short I'll tell you what isn't short the amount of footage that these guys' editors have to get through but there's a solution to that we have the best editors in the world if we have 10 hours of footage it gets sunk the assistant editors will take it down to 2 hours of what's usable like a really great editor an editor that can do videos at this level I can't find them anywhere and so preserving them and preventing them from burning out as much as possible is like the name of the game thank you dude you're a legend I love your videos by the way actually your editors are really good don't get any ideas man you guys looking a jump ship no I'm just kid all right let me take this off okay we're going to call it for tonight after the first challenge the timing on this is absolutely crazy my brain is so fried it doesn't feel like 3:42 a.m. yeah I guess there fluorescent lighting all around the place can you see my face here by the way this is the face of a man who's been awake for nearly 24 hours because of the sudden decision change today to switch from Day filming to night filming in fact scheduling just generally was easily one of the toughest parts of the shoot because instead of the original plan of 2 days of filming it actually ended up being three nights not to we've mentioned and the extra 3 days around those three nights that everyone involved in the shoot had to make sure they were always ready for not easy for anyone involved contestants included I'm just kind of used to it usually we end up filming deep into the night like this at night I can point lights and control where your focus is during the day you see everything so I prefer to film at night I mean it's pretty brutal rest up okay night two game two so in this game contestants will stand around a whole load of briefcases they look at a board which will tell them which briefcases are safe and which will get them eliminated and then they will have to get to one of those safe briefcases before anyone else can so what's going through your mind right now well I just honestly want to make sure the briefcases get put out right I just want to make sure it all looks good we have a lot of writing on this shoe one thing you've talked about a lot is the way you tell stories is that changing go watch a Mr Beast video from 3 years ago I'll be like 50% louder it'll be like 50% faster yeah and you'll get like a headache you're making like a purposeful effort in this video for example just just slow down exactly let some moments just sit Trust that people will watch because you know they're very invested in the story as opposed to like being tricked into watch because there's like cut cut cut cut cut what time is it right now it's only like 10: right actually yeah it's 9 9:00 p.m. oh yeah this is pretty early this is great like I actually should be awake right now and that's crazy did you talk to the people who got out it feel I felt so bad yeah there was some pretty real tears we tried to make it easier on them by giving everyone $2,000 that way everyone at least had something to go home with the first challenge we eliminated 400 people and since we gave each of them two grand that's $800,000 the money isn't the only thing these guys have to think about when people are eliminated do you remember these RFID bracelets well this is where they come in again there's some sort of checkout process as well when they entered the arena we scanned so we knew they were here SC baby so we counted that we had 2,000 exactly then we could start the game then when they got into teams oh so when they sorted themselves you added that data onto their rfids so that your system knows exactly which team Green Team yellow team then we have all those lists ready it's the same as eliminations so all of the red team that was eliminated even though we knew it was red team just to be absolutely sure we scanned every single one on the way out wow then we know if somebody's missing in the stadium is this because you've been burned before on previous games people are hide did you see the end of that game but Jimmy had to call her up to tell her that oh come on and red team's out she was a red team contestant he was trying to stay trying to stay in the game yeah so the bracelets are really a way for us to keep track of everybody now if you already thought the shoot was a complicated Affair you have not seen the start of it because it was at this point that I was introduced to a whole new branch of the operation this is Emily and she is a story producer having all of us here and just taking notes of choses that happen little quotes we hear that would make good content it just overall helps the post-production process so the entire role of these guys is to look and to listen to what's happening on the field to try and figure out what the story is going to be while the video is still being shot so that by the time it ends up in the post- production editing stage that team can be as efficient as possible part of the recruitment process you ask people to send a one minute video of themselves and you use that to judge their character and their energy and so you're saying as part of that you pick the top tier people and you're like you get a microphone yes 40 contestants are miked up out of the 200000 this board was the initial idea of who would get miked up I think as they meet the people and as people like show their true selves on the field they'll switch it out this is absolutely crazy this is movie investigation pinboard type by once people get eliminated they'll remik other people obviously like things change and mics change so like we have people designated to go out there and keep track of who gets remake which helps us like tremendously during the post-production process you've got Heroes villains family and then others you've not just pegged people as being main characters but you've pegged that they've got a personality trait that might make them a villain yes so yeah you can't predict the stories that will form but you can predict the people who are most likely to form them those people are given the microphon so that's fascinating are you listening to those people in real time on the average Beast video will have one person listening so we have six people and then I'm doing like visuals right now everyone gets seven people to listen to so that instead of listening to 40 people at once you only have to listen to seven people so this is the live universal time code and that's synced with all the cameras so you know exactly what's shooting when and then these are the notes the story editors are leading so this means that when the editors get the footage it will not just automatically slot in at the exact time that each shot was actually taken but they will also get all of this guiding information from the story producers so they know specifically what look for within those shots everything's been thought about yes so that's where all the story producers hang out this is basically Jimmy's private viewing Suite so whoa it's basically the same thing but this room is specifically designed for Jimmy to come and have a kind of one glance view of every single thing that's happening so you can give really quick feedback in between him being on camera there's a lot of screens here so there's 18 TVs in this one room quite impressed with the uh the bezels on these as well it almost looks like one continuous video War they're bringing out the briefcases for the next game should probably go you know what's extra crazy about this because everything that happens in the stadium is recorded and might end up being part of the video even the setup of things needs to be a rehearsed Affair it took 100 people nearly an entire day just practicing how to set this one game up lining up these briefcases figuring out how to enter the stadium in an organized way timing the process to make sure it doesn't drag and also measuring to make sure that every table was exactly qu distant I hate when it's like day of and we do those things and it's not choreographed cuz it just looks very amateur when it's all time to choreograph then we can timelapse it it can be like bring out the briefcases but if it's not like sped up time lapses good so it has to come out in an organized way that looks good when it's fed up yeah or then it just looks weird it's perfect for retention oh my god dude I love you more this Beast I should say that oh my God is that on camera no it's not yes it delete it right now please go all right three two go look like I see a people oh okay 3 2 1 reveal R can't believe you're getting reactions like this at 4:00 a.m. in the morning but now seeing this game being filmed there's another question that's been looming on my mind where does all the footage from all of these cameras actually go this is the dit room these guys are guess you could say the very important but very unsung heroes of this project cuz their entire job is to make sure that no piece of footage goes missing which when there's like 500 cameras on a shoot is a bit of a logistical problem so the whole process starts with these drives someone will physically run into this room with a box full of these drives what these guys are doing is taking the footage on that drive and categorizing it based on which game that footage is from which camera recorded that footage and which type of microphone picked up the audio for that footage which sounds like an absolute nightmare of a task but they're doing it so that when the editors are editing the footage all they need to do is to just think which bit of footage do I need as opposed to having to rummage through like a 100 different folders to find it but it will make the edit like 10 times faster right now this is where the fund begins they plug these drives into their computers which are all Mac Studios by the way because well I'm told they don't like Windows but then those Mac studios are wired into something called an ingest station which is eight very large hard drives every single one is 20 terab meaning that one ingest station has a max capacity of 160 and then you realize that there's 20 of these ingests in this room so 3.2 petabytes of storage but it gets crazier because they're shooting this show for Amazon Amazon have insisted that they have at least three layers of backup for every single bit of footage so as well as these ingest stations every single drive has never getting AR raas it will just stay as a permanent hard copy of everything that's been recorded and then every single one of these in stations has has a fiber cable coming out the back of it this is a very fast connection we're talking 25 GBS per second there's a very specific reason for this fiber cable and we can actually follow it out of the room way out of the room still going still going still going and you follow that cable all the way around and you end up with this which is basically just one massive server and that serves as the third layer of backup it almost seems stupid just how many precautions are being taken but then when you start to adding up how much they're spending to make the show it starts to make sense how much they're spending to keep the show this room is actually particularly cool for a few more reasons because these are video recording boxes so you know how it normally works with a camera you record onto an SD card that's inserted inside but these guys are doing it a little bit differently because every single one of the fixed cameras dotted around the stadium is physically wired all the way across the stadium into these boxes and that has two pretty major benefits one that instead of recording on tiny fiddly little SD cards they record onto proper drives but also too some of these cameras are no joke 100 m up in the air so imagine how much Manpower it would require to individually keep track of every single camera so that it doesn't run out of storage and then swap over the SD cards when it does but with this setup one person could literally man everything this is also super interesting so because this recording actually happens over a really long time like I think we hit record at 10: p.m. it's now 3:12 in the morning the lighting changes so this guy over here is actually in real time adjusting the color temperature the black levels the saturation of the cameras to make sure that they stay consistent both as the time of day changes but also between the many different types of cameras being used on the shoot because if you just left each one alone they would all naturally take footage that looks slightly different to each other this is the video router so it's the Box in which every single one of the video signals that you see comes through first to be able to be distributed to all these separate monitors so long story short if this box goes down so does the entire video which is why there's a 24/7 fan just blowing cool air at it so do you remember the pan tilt Zoom cameras that we talked about earlier well this room is also where those are being remotely operated from and the beauty of these cameras is they allow you to follow the action so let's say I find a disruption happening with these briefcases I can find where that disruption is happening and then I can just zoom in all the way onto that disruption so it's allowing me from a distance to create these really stable cinematic sub stories within the biggest that gets so close you forget that the camera is positioned right on the very end of the stadium it's just blowing my mind that all of this like all of this is the back end for one YouTube video just to be super clear do not go until I actually say the word goo he's our guy look up at the screen all right there you go see I'm oh actually I said it you're right oops oh my God I messed up but hey I think he's pied to losing have to be great how are you feeling nervous yeah I can see it on your face is it you versus every single person around you are everyone thinks I'm out really oh man yeah how will you feel if you are it's fine it's my dad's birthday today is that worth losing $5 million it's literally called Rick e it's too perfect 3 2 1 open your brief [Applause] K I'm with that I decided that's enough Beast games for today too much heartbreak 4:40 a.m. we're heading back that feels like a victory early yeah early the time had come it was time for the third final and most chaotic night of all starting with the flag game where all contestants are going to line up on one side of the field and each round a varying number of flags are brought into the middle contestants have to decide which round they're going to make a run for it and when they do they have to make sure they grab a flag while they're at it or they're out knowing that in total there aren't going to be enough flags for every player where they make the first like two or three like really easy so they get it and then after that we're going to do dozens of rounds I want you guys to be super dumb is there a dominant strategy you think there's a lot of strategy to this I would probably pick one quadrant and just be like well there's a flag here I'm going no matter what I'm going no matter what I like really try to talk everyone around you out of it it was also at this point that I managed to get hold of something that you never really get to see so these are prev visualizations of the Amazon thum thil and it's absolutely crazy like how these were pre visualization Mr who do not draft things is a clear favorite so far I think this one wins they have one version of this thumbnail poster image based on like 15 of the most popular movies and games from fortnite to money Heist to How to Train Your Dragon and this is the one they ended up picking from them before long the first flag it was time for the flag game to begin as soon as I blow this horn the round will begin I won't lie to you I found this game absolutely fascinating to watch oh look those two are racing for flag one it started off so organized with a few of the louder people basically making it very clear to the others around them that they were going to run for it so that no one else tries to but then as the game went on you start to notice that order breaking down because you can't stay on the sidelines forever because they will just run out of flags so this just got more and more chaotic there a tiny little drone up there zipping around the stadium I think we should find out who's flying it wait he's up there he literally looks like an imperial staffle Commander I think this is the one we've seen zipping all around the stadium like extremely quickly yeah this one this one as well oh yeah this looks very like homemade almost yeah they're all custom built did you do it yeah you made them yeah yeah custom built and then the gimbals are my designs who are you medin drum a few years ago I tried out the idea of using a head tracking to gimal just to see if it would help with camera correction and it ended up just being so much better than I expected you didn't just build the drones you built the entire system the head tracking system this tilt following my head yeah yeah wow previously fpv is always flown fixed angle which is where the piloting camera and usually GoPro are fixed to the Drone but the problem is that really limits the shots you can get like you can't like look down or anything yeah with this this gives you a full 5° of Freedom which pretty much means you can accelerate in any direction while looking in any direction so you're controlling the movement with this controller yeah exactly and your head is looking up and down movement is controlled by controller tilt movement is via HED rcking there's two cameras here one is the GoPro itself one is down here what is that doing so this is our piloting cam this is what I'm seeing in my goggles and then this is our recording cam of course of course right cuz you can't stream directly the GoPro yeah exactly that is absolutely incredible so this compared to like the big skycam that's overhead what's the perk of this uh perk of this is I can get inside of the crowd I'm not limited by my like range I can go up into the stand dive in do you get dangerously close for fun yeah yeah so because there's less Flags in this round he's been given permission to take off with the bigger drone you know cuz if there was like 100 across the field you've got a pretty good chance with that of whacking someone in the face whoa oh my god let's go have a look at the footage that is absolutely amazing so there's two types of drones being used on the shoot they've got 10 of the more standard DJI drones and if you look here you can see that those are the ones responsible for these slower more cinematic shots but then this guy with his first person view drone his job is to get really close and get these super unique in the crowd action-packed chaos shots if you have an idea and you think it might or might not work it's worth exploring cuz I didn't think this would work before I tried it and now it's changed my life so it's like wow good for you man that's cool team come true oh yeah also look a little closer at the seats in every single one of the 65,000 seats in this Stadium just for this video These Guys printed out and fitted a full-sized Slender Man only for the production team to later decide actually no that looks a little weird well that's a shocker and then send people out for a second time to flip every single one of those 65,000 Slendermen around to the blank side so now you only see their faces when you're up in the stands but now it was time to get closer to the most serious pieces of camera gear on this shoot this is the kind of stuff that you don't normally get to see like this starting with the sky camera which is being controlled from a box all the way in the top corner of the stadium so this is the aerial camera room this is I guess where the magic happens yeah you guys are the sole controllers of the sky cam yeah got the pilot right here I move the camera rig in space up down left right my operator Kirby over there pans tilts zooms focuses and gives us the best shot as possible oh I see it's like a tank turret versus driver exactly patchy helicopter I've never heard that comparison but yeah that go wow this is some of the most beautiful footage I've seen in my life what makes this different to a drone safer it can't ever fall out of the air and hit anybody we have a larger camera Lar larger sensor larger lens so we can create a little bit better image than most drones can explain to me what's happening on this computer this is our fly space I can always glance at that and know I'm 56 ft above the turf here is that important because you're trying to stay out of the way of other cameras and their shots and exactly so the coordinates that we use when we first get here we build that fly space and I can put walls barriers obstacles to keep us safe from hitting stuff so for instance the boulder structure over there I have a wall right here these yellow ones are ramps so we can go up into the sets and not run right into the pile of money yeah and so the camera will now do that automatically now that you've set those constraints indeed so when you go from green to Yellow it will automatically lift if it's too low that's right wow that's a smart bit of Kit and this is fascinating watching you two guys talk to each other cuz you're both controlling different parts of this camera are you telepathic we've done enough games together that we kind of think along the same wavelength if he's flying a certain direction I know what kind of look is possible from that angle that he's got the rig physically at so then I just pan or tilt Zoom whatever and it makes the shot look good it's like good dance Partners the longer they've been dancing together the better they can read what the other one's about to do you two would kill it on a dance floor so I'm seeing something and it's upsetting me a little bit are you recording in 1080P no they are receiving 4K just 10p to the monitors so that the throughput is limited this is just for us cuz that would be a massive waste yes indeed it would indeed it would I'm so relieved but it's easy to forget this show isn't just about filming a video it's a very real tournament with very real Stakes so as you've had a taste off earlier these guys also have to make sure that there are proper systems in place for adjudication so anytime two contestants think that they're the ones who touched the flag first there's a whole Squadron of Staff who have to run to that big dit storage room they have to take the drives that have the footage on they have to run them back to the stadium and then go through that footage from several of the fixed cameras frame by frame until each dispute is resolved and grabs it first the guy on the right would be the one that has possession this guy yeah yeah yeah this is stuff you don't see in the final Mr Beast video but there are disputes literally every round of every game and you can't move on to the next one until each one is resolved which as you can imagine is another reason why there is so much waiting around when you're on set but also do you notice how every single person working here is wearing a headset well each of those is connected to one of these called a bolero which basically allows you to talk to any other person in the stadium immediately without even needing to dial a phone number it's a version of like a a walkie SL telephone so you've got a walk which normally you talk one at a time this is kind of like that but I can talk over you this gets rid of the whole over and out Roger yes they're called comms or pl's which stands for party line which is a throwback to early phone lines when you'd have a whole neighborhood or a whole group of people they're all on the same phone number like on your pack here y all the camera guys are on that button so it's one button to talk to everyone who's been assigned as a camera everyone who has that button we also do a lot of like deployment of antennas there's one right there so those are all over the venue and you guys have installed these all yourself yeah our group of five guys here so you basically created your own mobile phone network inside the stadium yeah just for this one video and that's a wrap on game three and since the team were also determined to not let this go on for another day it was very rapidly time to set up for the final game well I say very rapidly like I said earlier everything does take way longer than you think but you know it took 3 hours to get everything for this game into position instead of 24 so this final game which is the game that determines who ends up making it to the main Amazon Prime show is a bit of a returning Classic on the Mr Beast Channel this is last to leave so contestants split into teams and each team stands on a pillar except they're not really teams because Mr Beast will then offer bribes of an increasing value until someone in one of those pillars jumps off accepts the money for themselves and condemns the rest of their team to lose by the end of this challenge one of you will backstab your entire team and to see this game in action we headed to one of the Box cameras wow look at that thing when you're on the ground it all feels like chaos but from up here you can see the action in a very different way so we've been told that this guy is apparently planning to sabotage the entire event and so the story producers have let this trained operator of the Box Cam know that and so he is staying locked onto this guy like a hawk waiting to see what he does just to try and convey the gravity of this piece of technology this is a 16 mm to 35 mm M lens which basically means you can go Ultra Ultra wide at 16 mm or decently zoomed in at 35 but this this camera right here is 8.4 mm to 832 these are absolutely Bonkers numbers like the kind of numbers that allow you to view the entire stadium in one shot or go all the way to someone's face who's standing on the opposite side of it and so the total price of one of these bad boys $100,000 each and there's eight of them the final game begins reveal what the first Pride will be it'll be $5,000 no takers he's going to have to up the state I'll give you 50 Grand oh hasn't started yet the second he announced it abolute cor didn't start that Tim yet oh my go no cuz the Tim hasn't started yet and that was a very strange rap on game four so now just before we get to the final cost of this entire production the only question left unanswered is this $5 million in cash I cannot believe they actually did that with real money you actually can't get through there without trampling on $1,000 bills how did they actually get it see this Mr Beast from JP Morgan Chase total is $5 million you steing some should we I mean probably would have noticed what do you think of it what do I think of $5 million in cash yeah how does it work to get that amount of money in cash cuz that's obviously not a normal thing that JP Morgan are approached with goes all the way to the top and then you know bring armored trucks with like a little militia to your studio and drop it off that's a fun BTS so that's how they get $5 million as for how they keep it so there's Stadium security on the outside police on the inside armor truck two security guys around the top that just sit and watch it so if someone made a run for it they would just tackled them it's in ones it's hard to run with a lot of ones I don't know if you've ever tried to lift ones no not that many just one of our team C briefcases proba pounds and so if you run with it I can catch you I'm old we estimate on the stage right now is 12,000 a Mony £12,000 that's the equivalent of two adult African elephants worth of pure paper notes they did the math so they could build the structure to hold it are there cameras specifically trained on that money as well yes we put extras on place we spent this entire 3 Days running around counting up the value of all the equipment and Tech that we've seen and so the final cost to make this one YouTube video is well we forgot a few things we got all the staff costs we got costumes which remember every single person here needs an outfit which is printed in house and has to be fitted we got the cost for all equipment used in each game every Boulder every briefcase and so on we've got the contestant costs 2,000 flights 2,000 Hotel I love how casually you say that meals three times a day over the course of a week not to mention a total of $2 million just in money given to the contestants who got out for this one episode plus the insane audio gear just to make sure that everyone's voice is picked up and sounds good on video if you have to guess the audio gear in this entire video what is it worth oh millions of dollars but then also stuff like the months of pre-prep that had to go into designing every game the cost of the Raiders stadium the place where the Super Bowl was held it goes on and on on but there's quite a big saving from the fact that a lot of the equipment you see here is being rented as opposed to bought leaving the final cost figure is $14 million for the video And1 19 million if you include the 5 million prize money"

the first half of 2023. 80% of Twitter either left or quit or was pushed out,
laid off, whatever you want to call it. And yet the website still runs. Even though two thirds of tech workers are men, more
than half of those laid off in 2022 and 2023 were women. Approximately 50,000 H-1b holders lost their status due
to unemployment over the course of this year. Canada is going to be developing a specific stream for
some of the world's most highly talented people that will be able to come to Canada to work for tech

performance. This is where you have not met Cloudflare expectations
for performance. We've decided to part ways with you. Yeah. I'm gonna stop you right there. This is a viral video posted by Brittany Pietsch, a
former employee of Cloudflare, a San Francisco based tech company. The video posted on January 2024 and got
so much attention that it may have kicked off a new subgenre of viral video: watch this person get laid
off in real time. The tech industry is again seeing widespread layoffs
after a rough 2023. LinkedIn just laid off nearly 700 employees. Qualcomm is planning to cut more than 1200 jobs. Google, Amazon and Snap are among the companies
continuing to downsize. And the start of 2024 seems no different as layoff
announcements, especially in the tech industry, continue to make headlines. Units affected they also include hardware engineering
ad sales so far. Last night, CEO Sundar Pichai told his workforce to
expect more cuts. An Amazon spokesperson did confirm those layoffs. The head of Prime and Prime Video and MGM saying in
that memo that the company is making some of the cuts to prioritize investments for the long term. Layoffs are also plaguing industries like health care,
banking and media. However, the tech industry is the one that's been
dominating the headlines this layoff. And everything that's happened in tech, I think is
pretty eye opening. You know, like you can have your dream job, you can
have your oh, it's my dream to work for Microsoft or it's my dream to work for AWS. And you get there and you realize huh, okay. It's just like any other job. It's a great place to be. There's a lot of great perks, but at the end of the
day, they can get rid of you like that. The layoffs to the start of 2024 signal a dramatic
shift in the tech industry. We're going to continue to see layoffs happen as the
future of work has changed, as the future of technology has changed, and as investors appetite for risk and
growth versus profitability has dramatically changed as well. So why are big tech companies and other industries
laying off tens of thousands of workers at a time when the US economy looks strong on paper? The start of the Covid 19 pandemic was a dire economic
event, at least at first. The tech industry, though, boomed. In 2020, Tech's top seven companies added $3.4
trillion in value. The Fed's emergency moves to bolster the pandemic-hit
economy, like cutting interest rates to near zero, helped boost tech stocks. This move helped the tech industry to expand and went
on a hiring spree as people were confined to home. Amazon added the most number of employees during this
golden period, peaking at 1.6 million employees in 2021. If you rewind before the layoffs, all the tech
companies were really putting an emphasis on growth, and so capital was really cheap, you know, so you
could get loans, you could get money. Access to capital was really affordable. And then you see, as interest rates went up and you
start to see that that growth in headcount didn't translate to growth and profitability and access to
capital became quite a bit tighter. You saw many companies start to hit the panic button. And so we saw these thousands and thousands of people
get laid off all at once. And that was quite a shock. 80% of Twitter either left or quit or was pushed out,
laid off, whatever you want to call it. And yet the website still runs. Um, do you think people are looking to Elon Musk and
thinking, you know what, we really need all these people. I do give Elon Musk credit for this, for kicking off
and making this acceptable Twitter. But a lot of the big companies decided to get lean and
efficient. And, you know, this is where you kind of start to see
the incredible leverage of what these tech platforms really have, which is they didn't need those people,
right? They were hoarding the talent. It was an option bet, and it was a cheap one for them. Yeah. I ask every tech CEO, do you take inspiration for what
Elon does? And they'll say on the record, no, we don't. We would never want to do that. But, you know, in the
group chats, they're all like, wow, that was an amazing move. The artificial intelligence hype of 2023 is starting to
have real world effects. In 2024, major tech CEOs are doubling down their
investments in AI. In January 2024, meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced
his plans to build an artificial general intelligence known as a GI. Hey everyone. Today, I'm bringing. Meta's two AI research efforts closer together to support our long term goals of building general
intelligence, open sourcing it responsibly, and making it available and useful to everyone in all
of our daily lives. All this investment in creating AI jobs, but at the
expense of others. The recent report from indeed shows that the number of
job posts containing gen AI terms has been surging. So there's about a 500% increase in the number of jobs
that mention generative AI. There's about a 6,000% increase in the demand for job
seekers for these jobs. But there still is, I think, a mismatch the other way
in that the total amount of demand for AI talent far outstrips the number of AI professionals. Every company in every industry is trying to figure out
how to use AI in everything they do. I mean, AI is going to create a lot more jobs as well. But at the same time, I would say that there will be
jobs that will be automated. So you think AI has already hit the business
effectively? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Especially in the tech sector. I mean, they've been talking about it for years now. The fact that you have more companies moving toward
artificial intelligence, and they're looking at the fact that as opposed to paying somebody 200 or
$300,000 a year to do the job, I can actually use artificial intelligence to do the job that they
used to be able to do. This AI thing is real. It's not going away, and they can't have people
holding them back. And so what they've been doing over the past year is
finding places within the organization that they can trim so that they can get to a place where they're
shipping faster. So taking managers out and then engineers who are
skilled for previous generation of technology, they're also leaving to make room for people who are more
skilled for artificial intelligence. Ai is definitely playing a role in the layoffs that
we're seeing. Uh, automation has increased efficiency for some of
the workers who are able to to utilize AI to make marketing decisions, to analyze data, to serve
customers more efficiently and effectively. So AI is a paradigm shift that is changing the way
people work and changing the priorities of tech companies. Right now, I don't. See that there's a big impact from AI in these tech
layoffs. Uh, some businesses have maybe cited that they're
trying to, you know, shift priorities, and they're letting some employees go to focus more energy on some
of these generative AI tools. But I think it's important to say that that's very
different than saying that companies are. Well, we can let people go now because, you know,
generative AI and all these tools are taking jobs. The tech industry used to have this shiny image of
having big salaries and unlimited perks, but the recent tech layoff stories have completely shattered
that image. I really don't have any regrets about posting it or
what's happened. I think the bigger picture is that I've been able to
be a voice for people who have gone through something similar. You know, the stories that I've received of
people who were laid off 20 or 30 years ago and they still remember to this day how that made them feel,
and it did not make them feel good. And I think that we should shed light on stuff like
that so we can make a change, otherwise nothing will change. In my experience, the public sharing of things like
one's layoff I think is partially due to the fact of the rise of social media
such as TikTok, even YouTube shorts. People are becoming much more comfortable with sharing
their experiences. And oftentimes when layoffs happen, people feel shame
when they are being laid off. In reality, though, oftentimes if people are being
laid off, it's a failure of leadership of that company. Tech companies that conducted widespread layoffs have
seen a bounce in their stocks. The tech heavy Nasdaq climbed 43% in 2023, its best
year since 2020. Meta was the biggest gainer among big tech, surging
over 194%. The tech stock boom also helped boost the wealth of
tech billionaires. The super rich CEOs saw their wealth grow by 48%, or
$658 billion, in 2023. It's hard, particularly for a company like Google,
which over the past 25 years hasn't gone through a moment like this. But, you know, we've always deeply cared about our
employees. Layoffs are not a sign of a negative developments. They are, in some sense a sign of positive
developments, of a greater demand for their services and of automation and productivity
improvements. Now we see the stock market reacted quite favorably to
this round of layoffs. We see these record stock prices for a lot of these
tech companies. And so the stock price, the investors really favored
profitability, really favored this lean year that these tech companies had. And so instead of rewarding the growth that we saw
them all pursue years ago, they're now rewarding profit. And so the layoffs have continued. People have become used to them. And regrettably and sadly, it seems that the layoffs
is going to be the new normal. Data suggests an influx of layoffs in the tech industry
starting from the second half of 2022 and peaking in 2023. Some non-tech sectors are also seeing widespread
layoffs. A prime example is UPS. The Courier giant raised eyebrows by announcing 12,000
job cuts in January. The media industry isn't immune to layoffs, either. In 2023, the industry shed over 20,000 jobs. And 2024 looks no different as big names like
Paramount, NBC, Sports Illustrated, the Los Angeles Times all have announced major job cuts in early 2024. The banking sector is also not shying away from
cutting jobs. Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank are some of
the big names that have already announced their layoff plans for 2024. It's worth noting that even though these mass layoffs
continue dominating headlines, labor markets still seem strong. The US economy added 353,000 jobs in January,
much better than the Dow Jones estimate for 185,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate held at
3.7% against the forecast for 3.8%. Experts are divided on whether the recent tech
layoffs would trickle down to non-tech sectors. Looking at the current job market right now, there's no
evidence that we're going to see any trickling. Obviously, you know, kind of the jury's still out. It's still early to tell. But it's interesting, as we look back at 2023, 2023
was a year of a lot of layoffs in the tech industry, and we didn't see any of that trickle out. Even within the tech industry, which is usually the
government usually defines it as the information sector. We didn't see a very high layoff rate, so we saw a lot
of companies announcing layoffs. But those companies kind of carried an outsized share
of the media because then once we rolled it all up, there was maybe about 1% of employment that was
being laid off. So really, ultimately, the overall rate of people
losing jobs to layoffs remains near historic lows. It hasn't yet trickled down to the rest of the economy. As we're seeing, the stock price is really high,
unemployment fairly low. But at some point, if this continues, uh, both
companies and individuals are going to have to cut back spending. And that has consequences that reaches far
beyond the tech industry. The tech sector shed more than 386,000 jobs in 2022 and
the first half of 2023, and that number is climbing. Google today joined a growing list of tech giants
scaling back, adding to the tens of thousands of workers in the industry who find themselves
unemployed. It is Amazon doing another round of layoffs. Mark Zuckerberg's year of efficiency back in focus this morning after another
round of sweeping layoffs and job cuts. The email that was sent out in the morning to everyone
in the company basically saying, unfortunately, your role was impacted. And that's how I found out. And then they pretty much shut everything off at the
end of the day. I was on the committee that was hiring new college
grads. It was like thousands and thousands of applications
for maybe like 10 or 15 spots. But I thought, you know, if we're still hiring new
college grads, clearly the company is fine. Why would we hire, you know, new grads if if the
company were going to do layoffs? Known for its boom and bust cycles, tech has seen its
fair share of layoffs in recent decades. More recently, the industry has faced headwinds
related to the crypto crash and the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank. Job postings for software development positions. They're down closer to 60% year over year, and they
are actually below their pre-pandemic levels. So we've seen a much starker pullback in hiring for
software development, which a lot of tech jobs. But while layoffs have taxed retrenched workers, a
booming artificial intelligence market is giving the industry a renewed sense of optimism. I have been in San Francisco for almost 12 years now,
and I have never felt this kind of energy, and I was here for the mobile boom, right? I worked at Uber, which I think was the one company
representing that mobile explosion. And I can tell you it was nothing like this. Every cafe, every restaurant, every conversation that
you overhear in the street, half of the time it's GPT, it's AI, it's the latest company that's being funded. It's it's accelerating. Generative AI startup deals announced or finalized in
the first quarter of 2023 totaled more than $12 billion, compared with about $4.5 billion invested
in the space in 2022. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft have also made massive
investments. The US tech industry accounts for 10% of the nation's
GDP. It employs roughly 12 million people who work in more
than half a million companies. Those businesses are concentrated in a handful of
coastal areas, including San Jose, Washington DC, San Francisco, Boston and New York City. So how have layoffs impacted tech workers and what
will the AI boom mean for their future? The pandemic and ensuing lockdowns brought the US
economy into a tailspin in March 2020, forcing businesses to shut their doors. By May, 23 million Americans lost their jobs. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest
since the Great Depression. But tech companies face a different climate. Remote work and cloud computing meant more people were
pivoting towards online services, boosting revenue spurred on by rosy predictions and lower
interest rates. Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook, parent Meta
and Google parent alphabet went on a hiring spree. Meta had about 72,000 employees at the
end of 2021, more than 60% higher than 2019. Alphabet had more than 190,000 on staff at the end of
2022, 59% higher than 2019. But after years of unstoppable growth, Big
Tech's pandemic bubble burst, forcing tech companies to trim their rosters. I want to say, you know, up front, uh, that I take full
responsibility for this decision. Um, you know, I'm the founder and CEO. I'm, uh, responsible for for the health of our our
company. Met was a company I've always wanted to work at. A Dream Job, a dream company, for sure. Carl Wheatly, a recruiter for meta, grew up in the Bay
area and spent four years working for the social media giant. Meta laid off more than 11,000 workers, or
about 13% of its workforce, in November 2022, it announced a few months later it was reducing
its headcount by another 10,000 employees. I was talking to my family about it. They grew up in the Bay area. They've been through multiple layoffs over the past. I think for our age group, I would say this is
probably one of the, I think, biggest downtrends or look for layoffs. Other companies quickly followed suit. If you want to think about a company that overbuilt during the
pandemic, I'd say that Amazon is the number one company that overbuilt. Where is where are the cuts? Amazon announced in January 2023 that 18,000 workers
were being laid off. Two months later, it said an additional 9000 positions
would be trimmed. That same month, alphabet cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6%
of its workforce. I thought, Holy crap, I've finally made it. I'm working at probably one of the best companies in
the world, and I'm making an amazing salary and I have longevity. Like I am good for many, many, many, many years. Paul Baker, a video producer in tech, worked at Google
for six years. We all got this email early in the morning on January
20th. It's just it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I actually froze, going, wait, is this for real? I opened my work laptop and it says no access denied. Like no passwords are working. So I had to look at my personal laptop, which had an
email from them stating, hey, you've been officially terminated. We're giving you two months notice, but like you're
cut off, you are banned from going to any Google office. You cannot contact anyone like nothing. Company leadership was in a far different position. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's 2022 compensation, for
example, was worth $225 million, about 800 times the pay of the median
employee. The company's stock has continued to climb since the
announcement. Other companies in this space that made cuts to their
workforce include Microsoft, Salesforce and SAP. While tech layoffs have been painful, the blow has
been cushioned in many cases by generous severance packages. Recently laid off google employees in the
U.S. received 16 weeks of pay plus two weeks for every year
of employment. Salesforce employees received a minimum of nearly five
months of pay. Stephen Campbell, a software engineer, was laid off
from Airtable, a cloud based project management service, in December 2022. One night I stayed up especially late and woke up to a
bunch of slack messages saying, are you safe? Are you okay? And I thought, like, was there an earthquake in SF? Like, what's going on? Obviously I'm safe, I feel fine. And as I woke up a little more, I thought, oh no,
like, I know what this is. And so I, like, opened up my work laptop and I got a
notification saying, like, your access to this laptop will end in 30 minutes. With help from a severance package, Campbell co-founded
two new businesses. RevAmp AI uses machine learning and generative AI to
get insights into customer data sets. His other business hosts in-person events to discuss
the future of generative AI. The thing about generative AI in San Francisco right
now is that there's similar buzz to crypto, right? There's all these meetups which I'm
fortunate to throw some of them. There's all this venture investment going into it. I mean, absurd amounts of money is getting funneled
into generative AI startups. The difference for me between generative AI and
something like crypto is generative. Ai is solving problems for people today. It's delivering value for people today. San Francisco has 11 out of 20 of the top AI companies
in the US by dollars raised. Collectively, those businesses took in $15.7
billion between 2008 and 2023. Investments in automation and AI at big tech companies
could be a contributing factor in recent layoffs, meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees prior
to its third round of layoffs that investments in tools like AI would help engineers
write better, code faster and automate workloads flow. Crivello founded Lindy in 2022. The company's AI personal assistant helps automate
tasks for workers like drafting emails, sending calendar invites, and taking notes during meetings. Something absolutely huge is coming, and I don't think
people have quite realized that yet that everything is about to change, uh, especially the
information economy and knowledge workers. Steve Jobs said that computers were
like a bicycle for the mind. I think that AI is like a jumbo jet for the mind. I think it is. It is going to radically change how
people work and go about their lives. Generative AI could add as much as $2.6 to $4.4
trillion to the global economy annually. I think, counterintuitively, it is actually going to
result in a net increase in employment in the tech industry. It's a basic fact of economics that when
something becomes cheaper, its complement becomes more valuable. Tech workers are a complement to AI. Ai makes tech workers a lot more productive. And so when something becomes a lot more productive
and a lot more valuable, we want more of it, not less. I don't know if I necessarily would want to say that I
don't regret getting laid off sooner, but getting laid off was such an overall positive
experience to me. Really, the only downside to it was the initial shock
that was tough to deal with. While layoffs are having a big impact on tech
companies, the sector is accustomed to periods of growth and contraction. Tech has always been an industry with very high churn,
and that actually comes from both sides. So job seekers have always really valued the
flexibility that they have in order to jump from tech company to startup to major company to really grow
their career. And at the same time, tech, because it's often at the
forefront, has been a subject to big booms and busts. The bursting of the .com bubble two decades earlier
eliminated more than 1 million jobs. The Great Recession spurred additional cuts. By 2008, Silicon Valley tech companies employed 17%
fewer workers than in 2001. But there are a few key differences this time
around. Even though two thirds of tech workers are men, more
than half of those laid off in 2022 and 2023 were women, according to a study analyzing more
than 1100 LinkedIn profiles. The groups most heavily impacted by layoffs include HR
and talent sourcing, software engineers and marketing employees. Bianca Brown started with meta in 2019. She was laid off from her job as a program manager in
2023. I tried to sleep the night before, I couldn't, and then
maybe it was around the 8 a.m. mark. I got the email. Um, my heart kind of dropped, you know? I took a deep breath and I was like, okay, you know,
this this is your new reality. This is something you have to navigate. The study also found 48% of laid off employees were
between 30 to 40 years old. 89% were based in the U.S., and the average employee
had about 12 years of work experience. And while the number of U.S. tech jobs are projected to slightly lag the longer
term trend, the demand for tech workers should remain high for the foreseeable future. The unemployment rate for tech workers as of May 2023
was 2%, well below the national figure of 3.7%. While tech companies shed a modest 4700 jobs that
month, over the course of the entire year, a significant number of jobs were added in IT
services, cloud infrastructure, data processing and hosting, and tech manufacturing. Employment opportunities for software developers is
predicted to grow by 26% between 2021 and 2031. It is a cooler job market for tech workers than it was
maybe a year or two ago. But at the same time, a lot of these skills and
experiences from the tech sector are still in high demand. Oftentimes, these tech skills and this
experience from the tech industry is very valuable in other parts of the economy as well. Tech workers are also finding jobs in other industries
desperate for their skill set, ranging from financial services and manufacturing to the government. Nationwide, tech workers earn on average $87,000
annually, 60% more than the average U.S. salary of $54,000. California tech workers average about $117,000 a year. Despite those trends, competition for jobs remains
fierce as unemployed workers face a restless job market. I've already applied to probably about 165 jobs, and
I've had only two interviews, and both were first interviews
after the recruiter, and they ghosted me, like, didn't respond to my emails. Nothing. So we're also living in a time where people
just don't get back to you. But if you go on LinkedIn, there's so many recruiters
and designers and engineers and everyone in which looking for jobs, right? There's hundreds or thousands of people applying for
the same role. I just tell everyone to kind of put your sales cap on,
get a tool where you can find emails, and you kind of have to go out there and kind of find your own job. The H-1b visa program is essential for bringing
qualified technical capability into the country. We need to bring Americans back into the workforce and
reform existing programs before we expand immigration. If 2 million more immigrants came to the US each year,
we could reverse our predicted population and productivity decline. After decades of deliberation surrounding US
immigration policies. High skilled tech workers are looking towards a new
country Canada. Many warn that if the US doesn't find a way to bring in
more of the world's best talent, other countries like Canada will. Canada has launched a new initiative to attract this
talent, as well as so-called digital nomads and skilled American workers. But how did we get here? And how does a country that is home to the world's
biggest tech companies lose thousands of highly skilled workers to Canada? We spoke with several foreign tech workers and
immigration consultants to uncover the story of how the US's bureaucratic visa process pushes workers north. It is very stressful. Every single year. The stress increases. It's not straightforward, it's very convoluted, and you
have queues and queues. Your ability to even work in a country and contribute
to the country is just going to depend on a lottery. The H-1b visa is a nonimmigrant work visa that allows
US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations. Specialty occupations require an area of expertise and
at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. These jobs often include high skilled workers in tech. Since its creation in 1990, Congress has limited the
amount of H-1b visas available each year. The current cap is 65,000, with an additional 20,000
made available for graduates of an American university with a master's or doctorate degree. Because the visa is sponsored by an employer, holders
who lose their jobs have 60 days to find a new job, transfer their visa status, or face deportation. Shiva Koul is from India but came to the United States
to study in 2013. She started working at Microsoft in 2018, who
sponsored her H-1b visa. I was lucky enough the first time, but I've had friends
who've had to apply multiple times and friends who did not get selected or picked up in the lottery
at all. Getting an H-1b visa has become increasingly
competitive. In order to get approved, an employee has to be
sponsored by their employer and then go through a rigorous application process. Once vetted, they are entered into a pool of
applicants who are randomly selected for a visa. Harinder Singh, a software engineer that has a
bachelor's and master's degree from Georgia State and is an H-1b visa holder, knows all about this. I have been in the lottery three times, and it took me
three times to get accepted in the lottery. For the first year, I wasn't accepted. For the second year I wasn't accepted. It was very stressful because if things don't work
out, you have to leave the country. In 2021, nearly half of the eligible registrations
received a selection for the random drawing. But for the upcoming 2024 year, out of the 758,000
registrations received by the government, only 188,000 were selected for the final
random drawing, meaning less than 25% received a visa and thousands were turned away. Once someone receives an H-1b visa, they'll face a
number of restrictions. I've been living here for a decade. I've been paying my taxes since my student years. I don't have the same level of rights that a person
who's from the states would have, but I have the exact same and even more number of duties since you're
not a citizen, and since you don't have a green card, you can't even work at a subway. Because you're restricted with your visa status in the
US, and you don't even have flexibility to move around, you don't really have flexibility to change
jobs. Plus, the green card process, which is the pathway to
permanence in the US, is a very, very tedious and a long one. Since holders are at the will of their employer, they
cannot change jobs or work side gigs. The spouse or child of the holder also cannot work
without applying for employment authorization. So you have highly educated spouses that are just, you
know, sitting in the US not able to work. Sometimes they're PhD holders that are just staying
home because they can't even work. A natural way to get past this bump is to apply for an
employment based green card. But for holders like Shiva who come from highly
populated countries, the backlog is longer than her lifespan. It's painful because all that's left between me and
that green card is one piece of paper. That is the last step of the green
card. And because there's a backlog, that's why I can't get
to that. There is no other reason for that. The US implemented a country cap of 7% for green cards,
which means H-1b visa holders born in highly populated countries like India and China are
experiencing lifetime waits. 75% of the people who are on H-1b visa in the US were
born in India. Majority of Indians suffer by this wait time a lot. They can never get permanent residency in their
lifetime. In 2023, the backlog reached a record high, with 1.8
million people waiting and 1.1 million of those people came from India. With the grim path to permanent residency, a lot of
H-1b tech workers are exploring their options. H-1bs were moving to Canada, applying on their own for
the permanent residents and doing it since I started, you know, 20 years ago, the highly educated
foreign national is really at the mercy of the US employer. Big tech companies account for a large amount of H-1b
visa approvals. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Meta accounted
for over 60,000 approvals in the last two years, but all of these companies, except for Apple,
underwent major layoffs in the past year, leaving H-1b visa holders in limbo. Like what affect that would ever take that is going on. And the US immigration rules. You have up to 60 days to leave the country. You have to gather your everything. And if you don't have anything doing, you have to
leave the country. Originally from Ghana, Anokye moved to the US in 2019
on a student visa, he received a bachelor's and master's degree in materials science
and engineering. After being laid off from micron earlier this year, he
transferred his H-1b visa status to a visitor visa while searching for his next step. I'm still looking for jobs in the US. It's not easy. Even till now, companies are still
laying off, so it's kind of a bit difficult. From October 2022 to April 2023, approximately 50,000
H-1b holders lost their status due to unemployment, and 12,500 of
these workers did not transfer to another legal status, meaning they had 60 days to find a new sponsor
or potentially face deportation. Then on June 27th, 2023, this happened. Over the course of this year, Canada is going to be developing a
specific stream for some of the world's most highly talented people that will be able to come to Canada to
work for tech companies, whether they have a job offer or not. And on July 16th, Canada opened visa applications for a
pilot program that would allow up to 10,000 H-1b visa holders in the US to apply for a three year
open work permit in Canada. This is unprecedented. Never heard of any similar program in the past, and. The program was a huge success, reaching its 10,000
capacity on the first day. But this pilot program is only one part of Canada's
tech talent strategy a larger, multi-year plan to recruit the world's top tech talent. There's been an unprecedented labor shortage in Canada. The tech field is growing, and the labor shortage has
been significant in that specific industry for years and years. So that's why the focus is really it's really to be
able to provide the businesses in Canada and the economic situation in Canada, the economic
immigrants it needs based on their skills. Basically, Canada's tech market has grown 15.7% since
2020, outpacing the US, which grew at 11.4%. The country now has 1.1 million tech workers, which
makes up 6.5% of the workforce. A CBRE study found that Toronto and Vancouver rank
inside of the top ten tech cities in the US and Canada, with Ottawa and Montreal ranking ahead of
major US cities like Atlanta and Chicago. Canada is also home to Shopify and other big
tech companies like Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Amazon all have a presence. Both energy and coal were affected by the tech layoffs
and have applied for and received their Canadian work permits. I knew he was going to be very competitive, since there
was a lot of other US workers who also have been affected on layoff, and
even those who have not yet been laid off. My main reason was to have a sense of security. I wanted to make sure that if nothing pans out, if I
can get a Canadian work permit and apply for positions in Canada before my grace period
expires, I can just move. The open work permit is not job specific, which means
they can work in any industry and are not limited to tech. And unlike the H-1b visa, they do not need to
have a job lined up before moving to the country. Currently, it is on my plan of trying to move to Canada
if I am not able to find anything within the US as soon as
possible. Personally, I prefer, um, mostly like jobs in my field
of study. So engineering. Others, like Singh, didn't apply but had Canada as a
backup plan. I had already applied for a different program to have a
work permit in Canada, so I was already in the process to go to Canada as a backup option. Not everybody is jumping on the next flight to come to
Canada. They're probably taking their time out of these 10,000
applicants and their families, how many actually do arrive in Canada? I also understand, at least from some of my clients
who have applied for this option only as a backup plan. They don't intend to move to Canada in the immediate
future. They probably want to wait for six months, one year,
probably see how it's going on. The Canadian government issues work permits at the
point of entry upon an approved applicant's arrival in Canada. It says so far, more than 6000 work permits
have been issued under the H-1b temporary measure. The H-1b is a really good when they move to Canada
because they established economically, they adapt really well, and usually they like Canada because it's
very similar to the US. It's always been a pool of ideal candidates. Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller wasn't
available for an interview, but a spokesperson provided this statement. The immense interest in Canada's H-1b
visa application stream is a strong indication of just how competitive Canada is on the
global stage. By 2030, the number of Stem jobs in the US is
projected to grow by 10.5% to 11.3 million. But in 2019, only 14% of us Stem students worked in
Stem post-grad. In fact, 62% of college students that studied Stem
worked in non Stem fields in Canada. After graduation, foreign students have an easier
pathway to permanent residency, the equivalent of the US green card. In Canada, most of our work permits are study permit. There is a direct facilitated pathway to permanent
residence. It's fairly new where retention is very important
because statistics show that people who studied here or worked here are the best at establishing economically
and contributing. Hakuna Kochar is a tech worker who came to Canada on a
student visa from India. He has since been able to gain permanent residency. I didn't want to go to a country where I feel like I
would always be a foreign resident for a long time if I ended up working there, and to me, Canada felt like a
much safer option. I graduated in 2021 and within a one and a half year,
I already have my permanent residence. Full time tech workers in Canada have an average salary
of $94,800, while the US is $129,700. However, this hasn't fazed many immigrants. I'm pretty stable in Canada versus I know many similar
friends who chose the US as an option, who didn't, who are still like struggling with that. And many have ended up coming to Canada as well. In Canada, the government uses a point based system
based on a number of factors, including language skills, work experience, age, and education to
determine visa eligibility. Unlike the US, it does not base your permanent
residency status on your country of birth. The Canadian immigration system in Canada is not
perfect, but it is more responsive to the, you know, globalization and the change of the
labor market or the economic situation more than where the person comes from. It offers a lot of permanent stability, peace of mind,
and that is not easily accessible in the current US immigration
system. Some say Congress needs to act in order to retain top
talent in the US. People should just take a step back and just revisit
and make changes in one go, instead of like taking eons to make those changes because it affects
people's lives. Reform is is needed based on the circumstances. But I think that all civilized countries are moving
towards, you know, shortage of labor, especially qualified labor. I mean, that's it's that train has
left the station everywhere. The policies are extremely inflexible. And when I say inflexible, they haven't changed with
times like there was a time when only a few thousand people came in from a particular country. Now you have, you know, plethora of people coming in
from those countries. As for the future, where do these tech workers see
themselves? If I had opportunity, I would like to stay in the US,
but if that doesn't work out, Canada is also a great country, especially for immigrants. I don't think. I would want to stay in the states long term for sure. I think right now people are choosing to go more to
Europe, Canada and Australia as opposed to the states. And frankly, if somebody asks me today if I would
suggest that they come here, I would not recommend it. So long term. I'm definitely going to stay in the US
because at the point of career I am right now, I have more opportunities in the US. I haven't really considered living anywhere other than
Canada because I'm very happy here."

Oh my god. You know what? I've actually done that one time. Oh, I've totally done this It's super cool. I did it to the school computers in high school Did it look like this? ah You know, I try to just block that memory out of my mind. What were you thinking? That it was off. Oh my god, you did it all by accident. Oh, yeah. you know, it's great though I've seen it where you can actually rip out RAM sticks and the computer will work for a little bit of time yeah, as long as it doesn't try to access whatever was in that particular stick of RAM or doesn't try to write to it because the Computer still thinks it'll have eight gigabytes. Yeah, or whatever Right, like this looks like somebody took one stick out and then the system was like, where did those bits go? I don't like this and that's what happened. Someone unplugged something and now the office internet doesn't work. Oh my god You know, what's crazy our server room look like that. It wasn't this bad. it was that bad. wasn't this bad I mean, that should be easy to figure out though. Just find your modem. I Mean, you know, you figure that potentially. Yeah, it depends on what you unplugged and if you actually have everything documented, huh? I understand how it happens and you know what a lot of the time It's not the fault of the people who are actually in charge of admitting the thing. Yeah, some third-party contract will come in They won't label anything and then your boss is breathing down your neck or your team is breathing down your neck to get their systems Back up and running you go. Okay. Well, I've solved it now. I'll label it later, times 15 years. Plan a burn the office down. No one looks for a bullet in a bomb. Custom loop. Oh god. Hold on. Hold on. No, I see it already There's some things about this that look very good. The orientation of the radiator will help the air bleed out of it. I Think I see where this is going What I had to look away What where did it? Where did the seal break? It didn't look like the tubes. Can you play in slo-mo? I don't have the o-rings in the CPU. It looks like it's there though. No the o-rings not in. I have seen this happen this generation of block needed to be Disassembled in order to change the mounting hold down. If you forget to put the o-ring in hey that don't seal. This is salvageable But my god, this is why when you test your water cooling loop you do it with water Not the like blue Smurf vomit, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. Oh, that's blue fortnight chug jug .Here We're over analyzing it with big brain. Yeah With the higher level of water in the loop could have the pressure and the gravity. No, they don't have an o-ring in it I should tell them it's not a touchscreen. Oh Okay, why is everything they want to touch right in the center? Apple if this isn't enough evidence That you need to make your devices touchscreen. I don't know what will be. what it looks like they were drawing here What are they drawing? Are they trying to summon some demon? It's like someone just lotioned up and went to town on the monitor But I like it this way it's convenient. Oh my god Okay. Yo, this is you like in another life. I didn't even realize how bad this was. Does it work? I mean, that's a cool function if you can make it work that way Oh, yeah, I'm all for it. When I first looked at this I was seeing the glass and I was seeing a phone propped on the glass and I was like, man You go and touch that phone. It's gonna knock over the glass. Your phone's gonna get that was like a battery pack Yeah, I didn't even notice that the phone is split apart Yeah, and then the liquid would spill directly into it, but you know you what you can also do is just lean the phone Against the glass. Oh, yeah. Oh, can you see them? Yeah, you could see them. Oh, yeah Absolute giga Chad right there Is that Elijah? Okay, that's gross Go full screen. We need to zoom in. I don't know if I could handle that This is actually disgusting. look it's convenient. So he's got Heineken and Red Bull Red Bull lots of smoke lots of smoke ports Is that pudding in the bottom left? Dude, dude, the top of the desk is the tip of this garbage  But look at the screen let go up up up up up see like he they're showing it off power aid Does the healthy, you know, why do you say healthy if there's like 17 packs? Hydrated I guess. Oh, that looks like this dude. That looks I think that's piss. Oh, no. Oh god. Are those pee bottles? Oh No. Oh, no. Why would you leave them open? Yeah, that's the problem Jake And they're on the look at this just just seems fake. Like I want to know if this is staged and I think we can figure it out. Look at this banana This banana has not been there that long You know, you're right a lot of it looks too new Like why are all the McDonald's cups like so pristine and like the Red Bull cans not crumpled? I mean, maybe this is just a hard day's work. You're drinking a lot. You're gonna be peeing a lot Maybe they take pride in their degeneracy. Like they've been like this for a long time. Yeah, check the comments Let's see what the comments like It's just apple juice How is that possible? Are those splitters? What am I looking at? Wait, go go back. Are those like those two-in-one Ethernet splitters that we did a video on? Yeah, looks like. that like don't work. What are they can work if you use them the right way? Okay, cuz you can use only four wires and so you split the two pairs or choose the four wires. Sure Yes, and use it that way for like cat5 or whatever, but look at all the empty ports on the switch above them Why are they splitting? Like what are they doing? What is the point? Okay. Well, what's on the next rack? Oh god The floor. Oh, you can't even walk in here. All the wires hanging from rack to rack really pisses me off more in all honesty What am I even looking at? Like this is a huge building with a non-trivial number of people presumably who are being paid Which tells you already that whatever company is operating here has a non-trivial amount of revenue that they clearly Do not invest in IT. Who hurt you? Who hurt you? That's like if somebody calls you to come work on this when you walk in the room You just go I'm a billing you hourly. No you go you turn you turn around and you leave. No, I take it What dude no, I'd take the money. Oh, I take the money. You know what? It seems like everyone in the comments are on your side. I'll be paid hourly, please. It's got to be hourly There's no way I would quote the job because clearly that's cobbled together from generations of a hardware Nothing like malicious compliance. speaking of malicious compliance. Our sponsor wants me to talk about the Eon 16 X But I'm gonna do it my way It's got a 2560 by 1600 16-inch display running at 240 Hertz for a Gaming experience, but if you want to use another display like we are today, it's got a ton of options for IO It's got Thunderbolt 4 which makes outputting video or connecting to a dock super easy it's got USB 3.2 Gen 2 type-c which supports DisplayPort and Power and it's got good old-fashioned HDMI 2.1, plus unlike many modern devices It's got three USB type-a ports and a headphone mic combo jack What it doesn't have is what we're about to look at. My heart stopped beating. That looks like our set Oh, I've seen this. Oh my god. This is Sarah. Oh good. It's us. Oh, no, it's us. Why? Oh god, I remember this. Oh, yeah Oh God why is it so crunchy? Just getting it out. Oh Sarah, please just the physical pain of Linus is great here This is just as hard to watch the second time. This is the worst one so far, like actually. Oh, no, it's got 7,000 upvotes. to be fair the computer worked after this Microsoft please remove the nightmare that has kicked off from install Now look Accessibility is a good thing. Yeah this Wasn't the right way to do it. Yeah. No, so this is an argument for imaging things. Oh, yes That's a great thing. Skip all this garbage. Yeah So sometimes when you have to do mass installs for office or a school you can set up one laptop and then use Microsoft's Imaging to create that and install it on multiple devices Yeah, that way you don't have to listen to a thousand Cortana's. No you make the user do it with the out-of-box experience exactly There's got to be a phobia of this people repeating the same thing over and over again. IT managers workstation user one is a domain admin. That's what, it was the login name Really? I thought Windows doesn't even let you do that. It's Windows 7 dude. What I just like sorry. Who is this? User one is the domain admin At least it's not just password That's worse because at least with password they'd have to guess This is just telling you what the password is. That's fair. Yeah. Well, the good news is when they fire their IT manager They won't have any trouble getting into the system. Yeah, exactly. I mean There's nothing like building out and maintaining a fancy Authentication system and then just making the password the username just don't have it This is the kind of office where like no one's really in charge of IT. Oh, yeah, right Someone has to go kick the rotor. All right, like this guy's leading the horse to water right here. Yeah, holy Single cat 5e holding up a rack, huh? Oh, they're tied it on here. Oh, I'm so uncomfortable Oh, I've seen this one. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh My god, that's mint. I'm so mad This one really bothers me. I'm confused now because it shouldn't like hook in here. Yeah, why did they take it down? It probably fell. You know what? I bet it is. I think the deep stuff is too deep to fit in it But then they've got stuff just hanging out the front anyway, okay, so it must sit in the bottom portion like it came out Yeah, here's the pills to help them feel better. Yeah, we'll just we'll just tie this Ethernet cable. We've done jank, but this is terrible. Don't do that at all. Why my internet keeps dropping Oh, is this just like follow the cable? Okay, there's gonna be a cat at one end of it This is gonna be a cat. Is this the power cable? It's a phone line. Oh, no, that's the power cable. Okay Okay power up over there heck is okay. We're going Okay, this is gonna be a jump scare. I'm gonna get huh to another power. Oh my god Don't daisy-chain, uh-huh. Well, are we going down into the basement? Did we just We're in the basement now. See a crack shot another power. Surely. He's got a closer power connection Is the house not wired for electricity except for one outlet in the basement somewhere that is legitimately possible Just open across the floor like, He goes to the neighbors house Another What f***, sorry part of my life. it looks like Asia, light switch There is so much wrong with that You know What's funny is I went through this with Yvonne's phone not charging and I realized that her phone charger was plugged into the bedside Yeah, I gotcha. It's got a light switch for yeah. Yeah, it took me it took me like An embarrassing amount of time to figure out why sometimes it didn't work. I'm surprised it booted I mean the modem doesn't take a ton of power probably so I mean but with how much other daisy-chaining stuff We don't know what was on the other end of the. 18 fridges on it. Who knows else? Yeah powering the neighborhood. Grow up. Yeah Chromebooks returned end of the year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I at my school. We had a laptop program We had to think pads, kids did the worst stuff to their laptops. Why would you do this? a child This isn't your property. So in fairness, though, it's kind of a vibe. I Kind of like it Halloween who needs a H key when you have Halloween key Yeah, they're like legitimately using it to learn a for Apple. What else we got here. There's more pictures, too Oh, yeah, right. Let's see if there's I study pimp ology I'll Thunder to your grandmother. I'll Thunder to your grandmother That's not that that one's pretty tasteful, yeah, I like this one. Yeah Chromebook definitely Chromebook It's done with like a watercolor paint. Yeah, like they did this an art class. There's pretty tasteful You know what else is tasteful is the back of the origin laptops with the next talking point. Such a good Okay, fine, okay fine. We'll talk about origins UV printing there This was done in a tasteful way as well. With the eon 16x and the 15 SL You can add your choice of HD UV prints or laser etching to make them unique And while they're not gonna be able to fix what we just saw if you do have any issues You can always call their support line for a helping hand. Okay user spilt coffee on his laptop. Oh No, and put it in the oven. No Oh Think pad too. oh There's so much wrong with that sentence and that is a fraction of how dead everything inside it is No, the best part is think pads have drainage holes in them. Usually so your liquid will flow through it That is true. That is some think pad laptops. Not all of them Yeah, but still with coffee you probably want to take it apart to get some of the gunk out because it's not just water This is black coffee. Maybe you're okay, but Still have something in there, right? Yeah, but not the oven. That's the TLDR The nipple is fine though. You can still use that laptop. fireproof nipple. Yeah, you lost the F key entirely You can't pay any respects to this at all. F Person mistook LED polarizing film for protective plastic and peeled it off. Oh, yes. I'm actually impressed that they were able to get that much of it off. I hope you didn't want to close any programs ever again I think we have an old video on this where you can actually take that film and like make glasses out of it So you can have like a private screen. Yeah, it's also a super fun science project, by the way Yeah, your kids to do that. It's super super cool. I mean like don't use a good laptop the eon 16x is way overkill for what we're doing today but it's got a sleek and compact design and manages to pack in an Intel core i9 14900 HX an RTX 4090 mobile GPU Wi-Fi 6E, 64 gigs of RAM and 3 terabytes of total system storage on Samsung 990 Pro NVMe drives. moving on. Hospital server. Oh, yeah, don't go to this hospital. You're gonna die. A battery backup though That's a big one. So that's something a UPS ain't saving you Like one pair of scissors who knows who's dying? Yeah, like holy Wonder what this bracket is from. Hey, they made sure they didn't lose the screws though. They're right there. It's for the UPS Top comments probably like I know which cable or something found a wall. Don't click on that. What is click on the link? Oh There's a guy there's a guy go back to the picture. No shot top middle Yeah, he's right there Think I might know that guy Jerry Man, the guy that noticed that is wild User dropped it walking to the car. It came in the day after the Super Bowl You are so full of s*** User that is not from being dropped. That's a I lost my bet. Or do you spike it in victory? Maybe? Depends on how he came in that day. Was he upset or happy? There's no way that's a drop. Oh, no, I can totally see what happened here Literally, you can see the bend. Yeah dropped it while walking to the car Yeah, I dropped it while walking to the car and then I drove over it seven times Customer came in with his iPhone his glass cracked He thought he could peel off the glass so he wouldn't notice the crack anymore. Well, I mean mission accomplished I mean, yeah, I don't see the crack much. I Can still see the crack How do you even go that far it would have broken about halfway like why'd you keep committing to it? It's like some real methhead energy or something. I don't know Why did you keep going. gouge that out of it Didn't you reach a point where you were like, maybe I should stop and he missed some glass here. There's still glass here Yeah, he left some of the crack. Yeah, that's the problem with this Jordan Hey, yeah, oh my god fair enough I need somewhere to set this candle. Yeah, not there Oh, they put it on top of a computer It dripped through the top grill It's like someone barked Pepto-Bismol into the case. The two capacitors in the bottom right make it look like Kirby Kirby has consumed this server. No, I know what it is. It's got to be like a cable box Mmm, that would also explain why somebody has a candle on it. It looks like there's like RCA jacks. Yeah I think this is a cable box. Oh Gross. is wax conductive? I don't think so Cuz like I'd be curious on if this PC as long as it didn't get in anything major. Maybe it still works. It'd be warm Cleaning out a PC belonging to a cutting stone shop. Oh god Well, you're gonna want a mask for that It doesn't stop there's a learnable here There's a reason those computers that are passively cooled like the industrial computer. Yeah, there's a reason they exist Bros, probably gonna have like asbestos poisoning after whatever he's blown out of there cuz that's nuts. What is the top comment? Anyway You need to be using a passive computer a sealed one. Yeah for this. Yeah, we have one in our shop for that reason Yeah, well, hang on folks. We've got another quick word from origin pc here It's all about their Aeon 15 SL If you need something a little smaller with a little less horsepower at a lower price the 15 SL might be for you It's still got a 240 Hertz 2560 by 1600 display along with most of the same IO we saw earlier It's a great option for anyone gaming on the go. Now this. oh my good my space heater stopped working I think a lot more probably stopped. How do you even do? That's straight up so dangerous. It's terrifying. Don't plug a space heater into a power bar And if you do don't plug in anything else, no, just don't. yes But if you do. just don't even says on the cable, I know yeah, but they also they compounded the error Jake They compounded it, this is a compound error. It was next to the heater. Oh So do you think this is, how does it get that far? And look that's a good point to yeah, like how do you get to this point and nothing failed beforehand? This is every level of scary. Yeah. When it wasn't a phone holder after all No, oh I've seen this one. oh my god when it wasn't a phone holder Oh Wait, wait, wait, wait now you can just lift this screen up and hold it up with a drink for yeah. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, no, no, just peel it peel off the glass parts. Oh, that's the part under it is flexible. You could do both Is that for like ventilation? That's what? I don't know. What is that for? I don't know. Yeah, you can't even access it It's not very big. What is that for? It's not a phone holder though. Someone's gonna know let us know in the comments I have no idea Tragedy. Customer put toilet paper between CPU and the cooler because he read online. It was almost as good. Uh The worst part is this looks like it was running for a while It looks burnt like it's got dust and stuff built up kind of where it would be in such Zoom in. Are you serious? It looks almost like it's kind of like just turned into powder. And the thing is that with a processor from this era The computer would probably work a fair bit. It would just thermal throttle to hell and back Mm-hmm, and the performance would suck. What article would that have been? AI? You know what? When was this post made? Let's close out of the just hit the X and top right? Yeah Yeah, no, it's not as good as thermal paste please use thermal paste. Don't do that yeah, or PTM 7950 LTTstore.com There you go. Bend it except My god This is nothing compared to the time we had the editors build their own workstations and one of them, Dennis. One of them, Dennis screwed the motherboard into the motherboard backplate without a standoff when the rest of the board was secured with standoffs Yeah, was it Dennis? And then proceeded to edit on that machine for several years. It was definitely Dennis. I believe it was Dennis. Okay end-user had a heater next to the PC was randomly shutting off She thought she smelled burning a couple of times. It was literally screaming. Yeah It's probably fine, yeah, but like oh At my old job. I've 100% saw this Yeah
I had a client who their computer was shutting off randomly and they couldn't figure out what the source was But they had a heater by their feet and the computer was under the desk Yeah, so it kept shutting the computer off. So I this is probably more common then we would ever like to admit. it's seem that is just the bezel at least too. It's not like the cases And yeah, as long as there's no longevity of heat damage to any of the components, right? All right
I got a couple more here down to the last ones. When Amazon support told me to bake my SSD in the oven May I know what happened. here, I'll be I'll be Amazon. You'd be Amazon. All right, may I know what happened? Yes, I connected this SSD to my computer. I tried both slots and the motherboard did not detect it I have another SSD and it works perfectly in both slots Thank you for the information if I may ask do you have your internal SSD right now? The Western Digital one that I bought from Amazon. Yes, perfect Can you please try to remove the RAM and then put it back a bit of a twist? Okay It is a Karen. Oh, it's his Karen customer To ours. All right in my computer. I'm using like to talk to you. Yes, please so polite The RAM has seen us correctly. I can assure you of that. Also if I did that I would have to end this call I do understand that this might be weird, but I'll assure you that this will work. Try to preheat your oven. Oh my god He just goes with it how much is that in Celsius The bot recommends them because they have a broken m.2 SSD to pull the RAM out of their system Preheat their oven to bake the RAM Did they say to put it on tinfoil to? wrap the RAM tightly in tinfoil. So bake the RAM bake the RAM. That is a wild I mean. Look reflowing things in an oven can work as a temporary measure to maybe Pull data off of it. If if a solder joint has has failed. Don't try to justify anything from baking ram.I mean Data recovery. We had to freeze the hard drive. So the opposite direction of heating. Okay it's fair. And you especially shouldn't put your RAM in the oven if you have a broken SSD and leave the power cable connected while you're baking It all right on to the next one. So this is why we don't run a 50-foot budget HDMI cable. Yes. Yeah You've been there. Oh, yeah, usually this is more than we usually get. This is long pretty good for a super long cable They're lucky. They've got anything. Do you remember 16k gaming and the hell we went through with the cables on that? I do Yeah, that's how I found infinite cables. That makes sense. Yeah, they were the only ones that had a decent quality Long display port. In Canada that could ship quick. Dude. We bought so many cables for that stupid video Yeah, like I think probably four or five different sets. I mean the right side of the screen is okay Just keep your discord on the right side I Hope you all had as much fun as we did I just want to take another moment to once again Thank our sponsor origin PC. Whether you need a balls-to-the-wall Maxed out eon 16x or something a little more modest like the eon 15 SL origins got you covered You can check them out using the link down below.

Is that a sword? Sick! The gunk level is actually not that bad. We asked everyone on our team to submit their setups. And now we're going to judge them. Like last time, we won't know which staff member it belongs to until after we give them a score out of 100. So things are probably going to get a little hairy. But I mean, we're not entirely heartless. Whoever gets the lowest score is going to get free lunch. Which we're going to pay for with money from our sponsor. Who I'll tell you about after we do a couple of setups. Roast number one, let's go. Oh my god. I don't know what's worse. The fact that that HP monitor contains so many bloody stickers on its bezel. Or the fact that they didn't take them off. Them not taking it off is clearly worse. Also this monitor is ancient compared to everything else that they have. This monitor has elegant functionality. Why are you being such a monitor shamer? If it's an old monitor, that's fine. My problem is that the rest of the stuff doesn't look old. They probably spent six times the amount on their keyboard than they did on their monitor. I don't know, the stain on their LTT desk pad looks pretty old. Or fresh. When I see a GPU that looks like this. And I see a mouse that looks like that. I see somebody who has their priorities a little... Who would be psychotic enough to do this? You can replace this with a 1080p monitor. Which is even going to be a resolution upgrade for... $75. Or on Facebook Marketplace. $20. I would buy a used one. Literally $20. Yeah. Wait, we have to rate them. No, we have to rate them first. So we get a total score to 100. Alrighty, we're going to reveal in 3, 2, 1. I give it a 35. Wow, really? No. You are ruthless. Monitor, zero. You don't get any points for that. You might as well not have one. I thought I'm supposed to be the mean one. This is Nolan. Nolan. His apartment flooded. So this is his after-flood setup. I'll buy you a $20 monitor off Craigslist. Roast victim number two. Nice. Well, this is obviously Nicole. I'm just going to give it a good rating because I love Nicole. Wait a second. Are those headphones? Yeah, I was going to say... Well, there's also ones hanging from the thing, but... You wouldn't use these when you have these. Would you though? Also have a lot of crust on your side glass. Real estate trading services. Is there a footrest? I actually kind of love that. That's kind of... That's a 10 on my vibe meter right there immediately. I really like that. 10 vibe. Really cool wrist rest. Cool keyboard. Really cool keyboard. Why would you take a picture of your nail clipper? And is that one of those ear cleaners? Wait a second. What's going on? This is a new place. No, this can't be Nicole anymore. The individual updated their setup between first submission and second submission, but this is the same person. I saw the penguin and I was like, Nicole, now I don't know what to think. Let's get some scores in. Well, I think we should rate the current setup. All right.
3, 2, 1. 44. 47. Dang. Nice setup. It's really good. It's Curtis from HR. Ah, okay. That checks out. The only reason why I rated balance down slightly was because the mouse pad. That's true. It's a good value. Like our sponsor, Ridge. Make those around you green with envy. Thanks to Ridge's voodoo green wallets and key cases. They're sleek, durable, and of course, very green. Grab them at the link in the video description. I like. Ooh. A lot of people going with the one vertical, one horizontal monitor setup. That's nice. What is to the right of his computer that's like as big as his computer? Really, Luke? You're so toxic PC master race. You don't even know what an Xbox looks like. At least PlayStation still looks like mildly unique. Dude. That is a hot take. What is with the hot take today? That is a hot take. To be fair, all the stuff that this person did looks really good. I mean, you never know when you're going to need gaming keyboard and better ergonomics. I'm not even bashing it. Clearly, this photo is staged though, and they still couldn't be ours to cable manage. I feel like this could be a designer setup. Yeah, but then they also have one of the more rare mouse pads, and their setup is quite aesthetic. That's the LTX mouse pad. It's not rare. Yeah, but you can't just like buy it all the time. That's true. You can just take it. Oh. Yeah. 46. Apparently, I like 47. That's pretty high. This is Chewy, our social media manager. Nice. That checks out. Nice. Alrighty. Roast victim number four. Wicked cushions. This is neat. Yeah, the keyboard's cool. Your temp is zero, so you haven't configured anything. Wait, go back to it for a sec. Okay, the date's right. Are you really going to give them vibe points for having the date correct on their computer? I mean, you can't even browse the web properly if the date's not right on your computer. I like the case. Whoa, just the wheels. Got some wheels. Hey, you know what though? You've got to store them somewhere. You're supposed to store them inside. It's actually kind of a vibe to have them right next to the computer. I kind of like it. Is this Plouffe? Okay. Don't look at me. I'm not saying anything. Keep guessing. No, there's no way. Why? Because Plouffe has aesthetics. Well, no, he doesn't. But he has more junk. This looks really nice. This is where the care goes. Yeah. How is everything out of your mouth? Even the nice things. Just brutal. The desk was featured in Do You Need Gaming Hardware? I bought it off the company the first month I worked here. They said it was okay because they weren't going to send me back to Ontario. Oh, because he would have been on probation, so not eligible usually for a staff discount yet. All right, let's rate it. All right, three, two, one. Forty. Forty-six. Dang. I was going to go higher, but then I wanted to troll Jamie. There you go. You got it. Jamie from Logistics. All righty. Next person. Wow. I likey. Got the monitor arm. Got the cable management. The banana looking wrist rest is actually kind of cool. 3D printed headphone holder. No headphones to be seen, but man or lady of culture. And that's the correct era too. Are these CPU boxes a stand for your tower? Everything else about this is so classy. What the fudge? I kind of like it. Oh, you would. I kind of like it. You need all these computers for it. I like it. Yeah, sick. All righty. Three, two, one. Forty-four. Forty-six. Nice setup. Yes. I took points off of those boxes. They suck. I put points on for those boxes. They're awesome. But your vibe is going to be pretty high as long as you've got floppy disk coasters. I think this is Jesse. This is Nick Harris from the labs. Yeah, that makes sense. Dang it. All right. Next victim. Why is the only thing I can see this MacBook charger on the floor? We've seen surprisingly few cringe anime waifus so far. I knew it wouldn't last forever though. Cable managed. I like to see it. Cable management looks fantastic. Cable management box. You left a sticker on your subwoofer. Please take the sticker off. Okay. I mean, that's where boxes go. Even more. Oh God. Cute. I thought it was like a plush at first. Very cute. Okay. I thought it was taxidermy. No. Fired. The graphics card was given to me by Linus when he gamed against people for graphics cards and he beat me so hard. He gave me another try. This was at the verified actual gamer live event. Just based on the graphics card that I apparently gave them. Is that a hint? No. I don't remember this. Well, this person must not have been an employee at that time? Question mark. Could you compete against you as an employee? I don't think so. I don't think so either. I just don't remember this. Rating time. Yeah.
Let's give a rating. 3, 2, 1. 40. 48. 40. 48. 48. What did you give them a five for? Value five? Look how much they spent on anime figurines that they could have spent on their computer. This is James Lin, our new test technician. Oh. Roast victim number eight. Ooh. They got the water-cooled Mac Pro. I forget who bought it. Or won it at the Christmas party? Is that a gaming controller next to a Mac? I have so many questions. Yeah.
Let's go to the... Mac gaming. I like it, actually. I think I can be fired for saying this, but I love their mouse pad. It looks really good. I kind of like that they matched the vibe of it being in the kitchen with the, like, kitchen-style stool thing. No. Your chair needs wheels. A computer chair should have wheels. Cameron, none. No one needs to see me in my messy apartment. Okay. Cool. What do you rate this? 3, 2, 1. 41. 46. This is Tatiana from Creator Warehouse. Oh, that checks out. You're going to lose some value points for gaming on a Mac, though. However... Whoa, you rated higher than a 10. However, I gave a 12 for the tower. It's a water-cooled Mac Studio. That's the coolest thing ever. All right. Next victim. Is that a shower? No. No, no. That's a window curtain. I thought it was a shower curtain. F***ing tin of cookies. Just, like... I mean, this looks like it's supposed to be for a racing setup or something, but no wheel to be found. No.
No, it's not for a racing setup. Heavy curtains to ensure that no light gets through. For a vibe-out, hard-while-chillin'-on-the-couch setup. That's what it's for. Case, the cheapest thing Canada computers had on hand. NTG2 shotgun mic? That's what I'm talking about. You see that interface, too? With camera? Nope. So you're just a serious business gamer with a shotgun mic and the world's nastiest carpet. Like, I can see the chunks of things on it from here. Alright, 3, 2, 1, reveal. 23. 32. Vibe 1. Peripherals 10. What? Vibe 10? This is Jordan, our writer. Dang it, Jordan. I gave it a 10 vibe, not because I like the vibe, but because it has very strong vibe. I can't give 10 vibe to anything that has this layout for the desktop icons. We're gonna have some extras over on lmg.gg/floatplane. Oh. The fact that it's Plouffe on the desktop wallpaper just means they haven't changed the default wallpaper that logistics puts on everything. This is a Jamie Pilkey initiative. Yeah. 7 terabytes. Is this a flex? Don't have much files to store on it, lol. I kept watching the, uh, what do they call it? Note how he blames me and then immediately says he doesn't blame me. I gotta fight first. Oof. I breathed in because I was gonna do a take. Alrighty. Victim 10. Okay. The Disney wallpaper. Yeah, wow. With the stuff on the door. You are clearly still in your childhood room. The headphones are hung up. Yeah, I'm not liking the headphones here. That's gonna dent your headband. Yeah. Also, this is not enough mousing area. What is this doing here? What is, what is that? Looks like Paddington Bear or something. Something that had a volume knob. All right. I somehow moved into my partner's childhood bedroom. Yeah. Alrighty. 3, 2, 1. 30. Dang. This is young. One of our newer editors. Lame vibe young. Although it is a young vibe. You know what? They, they, they went as hard as they possibly could with the monitors, which I respect. You can't just grade people based on how many monitors they have. No, I'm just- There's more to life than having a bunch of monitors, Luke. Yeah. And they're clearly like making it work. Good value though. Clearly don't waste money. Yeah. Traxxas. An RC nerd. Got the project mat over there. Really like the inclusion of the project mat. This is my vibe.
Right next to the computer. This is my vibe right here. Great. 10 vibe. So this is right beside it because you can see the project mat. Oh, so it's a turn left, which I like even more. Ooh. Getting stuff done. I agree. See, this is how you can keep some boxes, but have it be tasteful and classy. Okay. Stash it. You know? Is that a cushy footrest? I like it. Computer build wise, it makes almost no sense. Bottlenecks everywhere. No, no, that's okay. Yeah.
Your CPU could be a little bit more powerful and you'd get a bit more out of that RTX 3090, but it's not that bad. 3600 DDR4. What are you even talking about? Don't beat yourself up so much. You're going to lose a point on your tower. You're going down to nine. For being mean to yourself. For not knowing that it's a perfectly good tower. It was built in a Scrapyard Wars type fashion where whatever was cheaper on sale, I bought. Nice. I'm giving them the point back. No. I feel like last time my whole thing was people had really bad mouse pads and now my whole thing is people only have one monitor. Can you stop shaming people? You know, some of us can only look in one direction at a time. Reveal in three, two, one. 45. 46. I love this setup. Very good. This is Justin. Nice. Fabricator for the writing team. Really good setup. Yep. And I hadn't even noticed Link up here just overseeing and making sure that everything's going cool. I didn't notice either. Love it. Alrighty. Next person. The cup holder that perfectly fits the LTD water bottle is kind of sick. The mouse pad. Yeah. That mouse pad needs some help. You could have spent some of the money you spent on a Mac on having a decent mouse pad. Got him. What is this? Why is your speaker pointing over there? I respect the box monitor stand though. I respect it. Yeah.
Especially. Especially when you didn't have the budget for something better because you spent it all on AirPods Pros. Is that a smoke detector? I don't know. Does it hurt holding on to a dying IP like this? It does. I know. I'm not even holding on and it still hurts. I know. So you can tell they haven't given up. Yeah.
It's modern stuff. Yeah.
Current era stuff. Some old stuff. This is so sad. Yeah. It's got the whole vibe just changed. Yeah. That took a lot of the excitement out of this for me. These are super cool though. Yeah. Or at least they would have been when Star Wars was cool. Yeah. Kind of a cool place to hang out. Yeah, actually. Got the AC. Love it. They put the good mouse pads there. Two chairs, sorry? And yeah. Yeah. Wait, what? Better mouse pads. Yeah.
Why are your better mouse pads over there where there's no computer? Are you operating your air conditioner? Three, two, one. 40. 40. Vibe two? Yeah. Star Wars morning really killed it for me. That's fair. All righty. This is Liam from the floatplane team. Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. Whoa. This is a sick setup. This is awesome. Under desk mounted Terra. Managing to have, you know, some clutter, but keep it super, super tasteful. You got some Mario, some Lewis Hamilton. You got your frigging speaker down there. Vibe three. Holy. No, I cannot. I was so into it until we got to anything to do with audio. If my ears were in my crotch, then this is a great setup. Also, leather mouse pad, value. Four. Three, two, one. 35. 46. And I'm pretty sure this is Maria. Correct. Overall, I think that one's really nice. I just, yeah. Your ears are up here. Yeah. All right. Next victim. Based. Is this a bag of apples? Going from Maria's setup to this cup of urine on the table. Get over it. Is that a CERN cup? Oh, man. You're going to need some string, Luke. Oh, man. Here's some string and lip balm. Vibe 10. I love this. This is sick. Is that a huge bottle of isopropyl? I think so. This can't be that old, Luke. The bread plushies from this year. Yeah, whatever. It's sick. Everything about this is awesome. It's just juice. Get over it. Don't bother putting this in your case. I mean, you'd hate to keep track of them. Doesn't need them to charge right now. It's fine. You take it a full level past the box of Kleenex, and you go straight for fast orange hand cleaner. You real, man. I mean, why contain the mess when you can clean the mess? But you know what? Vibe 11. Is that a sword? Sick. Oh, my God. Well, we found them. We found the wipes. I think there's some deodorant. Some deodorant. I think it might be Tynan. It's almost certainly someone from the Creator Warehouse team. And seeing that exercise ball as the chair. Oh, and the first aid kit too. He's like safety first aid guy. It's like obnoxiously safety first aid. He wanted baby gates after I fell down the stairs. I'm just going to say I like the exercise ball chair. I'm giving him a 9. I give it a 43. It should have been a 49, but it got a 50, because I gave the Vibe 11. That's kind of cheating, but it is Tynan. Next victim. What? Green zip ties. Classy. Power button. Equally classy. Wow. It's weird, because it's almost like you broke into someone's house who had a really cool vibe, stole a few of their cool things, and then brought it to your weird, like, masturbation cave. It's almost like a gradient. And then you get to all the, like, cans, and it's like... Right? Why is the middle monitor tilted so far down? Oh, yeah, look at that. Do I recognize the mouse pad as being a particular person's? That may or may not be here right now? I didn't think this is what their setup looked like. I'm not confirming anything, bro. Well, no, I mean, I know he has a stupid frame case. That's him, too? He has a stupid frame case? He has a super stupid frame case. That is a really stupid frame case. It takes up so much space at LANs. What's really interesting, too, is you can really see how bad the cable management is everywhere, because you can see right through the stupid frame case. There's not nearly enough pathetic simp shit here, though, so I'm not sure that this is Elijah yet. But it has that garbage keyboard with that wrist rest. Oh, wait, it's a Belle Delphine wrist rest. Yeah, this is almost certainly Elijah. Why are two of them the same? You had opportunities to make custom screwdrivers, and you made two that are the same except for the shaft? Where did you get a black shaft? It was in a bin. You know he's the next AMD Ultimate Tech upgrade, right? Well, he needs it. I don't even know if I want to go in this house. I found more simp bullshit. That's just the same keyboard case. Yeah, but the thing is, like, why are you proud of it? It looks good on a shelf. Oh, my God. You know, this is more than the average American has in their bank account. This is probably more than Elijah has in his bank account, because he put it all here. I will not confirm that. Why is your middle monitor pointed down? Well, the mount is not strong enough for the weight of the monitor. Also, why'd you buy a curved monitor? I didn't. Where'd you get it? Christmas party. My old job. Okay, let's get to work. Sounds like I'm getting lunch, boys. Oh, yeah. We can't rate him too low, because then he gets rewarded for it. I've already decided. He's trying to win a free lunch. All right, 3, 2, 1, reveal. I don't want him to get anything. Yeah, all right. I gave him a 30 for balance, just so that I'd be able to give him a high score, so he won't lose. All my other ratings are real. I love that we coordinated on that. Dang it. I had already given him all 10s before anybody said anything. And I didn't see it. Well, thank you. At least I can say I have the highest score now. Really high rating on that one. Belovedheadphones.png. They've been loved. My main desktop is so messy, you don't want to see that. You know what? I love this art wall, though. This is so authentic. 10 for vibes. Given how clearly old this is, the gunk level is actually not that bad, given how old it is. To be able to wear all the way through that, like, ooh. How do you wear through the entire side of your mouse? That's really impressive. It honestly probably gives them a really good grip, though, because their thumb's going to, like, slot into position. It probably feels great. If this mouse dies, they're probably going to be very sad. I remember this chair. Yeah, the Costco Deluxe. Yeah, it's a piece of crap. My chair is peeling, my headphone pads are falling apart, and my thumb has destroyed my mouse, and I'm running out of storage space. Please send help. I agree. I'm taking off some points for that crappy chair. I got suckered into the same one, so I'm just mad still. That's... You didn't do anything wrong. 3, 2, 1, go. 41. 47. Ah! Yeah, nice setup. This is Hannah, the editor. Oh! Nice. Relatively new, just off probation. I hope your mouse never dies. Welcome, Hannah. She seems to not be that stoked on the mouse. I think you like the mouse more than she does. Maybe Luke would buy it from you. No. This is not the same. My thumb is not going to go in the exact same spot. It would have to be the exact same spot for it to be good. Ooh! With the Evangelion case? With the matching water bottle? Okay. Vibes are maxed. You didn't even talk about the CRT yet. Oh, it's sick? I don't know that it's... It looks actually like it might actually be legit. Any tips? You're asking for tech tips? That's not what the notes are for. Cue less jarring. 3, 2, 1, reveal. 34. 49. Wow, quite different on this one. Yeah. I really like it. That computer's stolen from work. He gets a zero. You know who it is? I know who this is. This is Sam. Sam, the editor. Yeah.
We just filmed an AMD at his house last week. Sure did. Zero for stealing that computer. No, in all seriousness, he won it at the Christmas party. He won it at the Christmas party. Super nice computer. Hold on, let me fix this. That's the equivalent. Let me fix this for you. 44. 44. Bin Laden? What? Bin Laden. Okay. This person wants the free lunch. A lot of action here. Got an Xbox. Body piercing spray. That's a weird thing to have on hand. Is that a Dreamcast? All right, you might be slightly... Oh my God. No, I know who this is. There's no way that this isn't Tanner. Oh my God. Why is it... Why are there so many pic... I don't even think this is Tanner anymore. Is that... No, that's one of the LTT Bean... Oh no. Hold on. Wait, no. Because Alex D's place is nice now. I'm so confused now. That is a dusty Vita. How many pictures do you need? Who are you? Base Star Fox. It's almost too tidy to be Tanner though. All right. I think I've seen enough. Really? You're not going to take the wrap off of that CPU block? All righty. That's higher than I intended. 3, 2, 1, reveal. 30. 42. I don't really vibe with it and the value is not good. You've spent too much on Wii games. You said you think you know who it is. Who is it? Yeah, this is Emily. Yeah, there you go. I know because I painstakingly assembled that piece of shit. Correct. In her Intel Extreme Tech upgrade. I give this a vibe of 12 and a balance of 10. It is very balanced. The expense paid for retro games is very balanced across the entire room. CableTie.jpg. Okay, I can see why it was included. That is the world's cutest cable tie. That is a very cool cable tie. That's a really long headphone holder. Do your headphones hang low? Do they wiggle to and fro? What is the point of that? Ninja printed. Luke's favorite. You just got a 10 for your peripherals. Peripherals, 10. He hasn't seen anything else yet. I don't know. You might end up with a 6 for having only one monitor. Maybe. 7 actually is my standard score. Looks pretty great. I like that mouse pad. Sarah did a good job on that one. It's limited edition. By and large, our staff have pretty nice setups. Other than Elijah. What the heck? 47. 40. I like it. I took some points off for that chair. This is Natalie from Creator Warehouse. Oh, yeah, okay. I'm not rating the chairs so much because I find chairs are so specific. Yeah, it looks like an off-brand DX Racer which is already not a good racing chair. Yeah. No offense, Natalie. If you stole it from work, then at least I could have boosted your value mark. 117, 117, 117. Someone might like Halo. Not sure. Yeah, I got a couple. What are those Funko Pops or whatever? Oh, yeah. MasterChef. Yeah. This is under your desk? This is where you display your collection? That seems like the world's most useless place to put those. Yeah, they're already useless. If you're not going to put them on display, good cable management, though. You did not pay extra for a My Hero Academia chair. Value down! You took too many pictures. I'm taking off a point for that. Ollie, lucky setup. Love it. 43. This is Mitchell. Good stuff. Customer service. Nice. Whoa! That's pretty awesome. Okay. Paper on top of your computer. Yuck. Mouse pad hanging off the edge. Equally big yikes. At least it's hanging the same on both sides. Yeah. That's cool, though. It's super cool. I'm not 100% sure what's going on there. UPS, though. Very nice. I respect it. I respect the uninterruptible power supply. There's a lot of cables, but they did do some work to make them not horrible. This is not how ring lights work. Ring lights have to be close to you. They put in the effort. Yeah. They stole a lot of extra large cable arches from work. This individual bought them. They bought them. Yes. And couldn't figure out the key bar holder. Struggled with it for two hours. The only person I can think of who's this dedicated to sticker bombing things is Ploof. Isn't that literally how he sticker bombed his cooler, though? I don't remember. I remember that now. This is a very different setup, I think. Yeah.
Did he move? Oh, wait. No. He has gotten into figures, hasn't he? Oh, my God. Does this guy really need more hobbies? Oh, yeah. Hold on. Outed. Frickin' outed. Three, two, one. 36. I didn't write a total, but a lot. Great vibe, zero value. I think you waste more money than Elijah, which is truly remarkable. I gave him extra points for the monitors just because I thought that would make him happy. No other real reason, to be completely honest. And also gave him 12 for the vibe because I really like the couple setup and how they're kind of meshed together is really cool. And he's got a UPS because he's trying to be smart. And just like there was a lot of things that contributed to good vibe. All right. Well, that means our winner of free lunch with the lowest score of 54 is Nolan. Enjoy your lunch, Nolan. Very first one we reviewed. And enjoy this segue. I'll try to get you a new monitor. To our sponsor, Rocket Money.

machines and gadgets we're going to buy them we're going to fit them and then we're going to test them to find out if we've made a big mistake so quite a few of the big things already done we've got the hob we got the oven we got the tap so what do we need I guess we still need a toaster so you might have seen I'm semi obsessed with this Japanese brand called balmudo yeah it's literally like the first thing you make anyone experience when they come into the house but I thought if we're going for the most high-tech kitchen is there a more high-tech one and then I found this one revolution Pro why didn't you just screaming on a toaster tap your toastiness level 1 to 7 and watch it toast in half the time so this is actually an interesting dilemma it's either we go for the slow methodical balmuda experience or the really really fast toaster I think we need to test the balmuda against this that's a fantastic idea winner stays yeah I'm actually curious like what's uh Tik Tok saying about kitchens with the ninja creamy you'll never buy ice cream again because it turns just about anything into ice cream frees your ingredients and it does the rest it's just asking to be tested let's try it they also do a slushy machine which is either a complete waste of space or a dream kitchen gadget I can't actually tell we also need a microwave the microwave is no longer your kitchen's greatest I saw and then it shows us this interesting that's a TR sh this one's actually okay in know 1,000 W microwave but then it does 1100 W powerful steaming we need a blender smart blend technology I me they just added the word smart to what it is 100 speed touch slider 100 speeds is a lot of speeds and a Sleek show stopping design I can't imagine many people are going to be stopping looking at this looks like the best one £849 for a blender so one other the things someone really recommended we try Sonic ice so it's made with flaked ice compacted into cylindrical nuggets and is love for its soft Airy texture that makes it more pleasant to chew what kind of psychopath chew their ice wo glacial Pro so this is what it looks like we already tiny in Pebble West wa yeah super fast ice nuggets in 4 minutes wow I have bought a lot of Gadgets in my time but hits different when you're buying it for yourself another thing we don't have is a bin yeah I mean the mounting bags of trash in the corner reinforced our statement so what about the one you have outside your studio right now yeah it's a really good bin to be honest it's got a little sensor and anytime you wave over it it opens straight away and it's really quiet as well I wonder if there's something else this is a pretty cool site yeah simple human really nice actually it's very much the vibe of this house this is interesting is that what I think it that's like a paper towel Hub and you take out the middle and that's a spray bottle that's minimalism sensor pump for your soap yeah that that does make a lot of sense doesn't it so you can control how much you get based on where your hand is put your hand up close to a small da or further away from wall feel like it's going to be a little bit of a learning curve there like a couple of times at the start you got to put your hand here be entire canister I think it's just a standard dish R I really like it it's clean oh yeah I just remembered Robot vacuum cleaner one of the big reasons why we actually bought this house is is because every single floor is just concrete floors with no seams between the rooms so one Robot vacuum cleaner will cover the entire floor and this has to be the one so now that we got all the basics it's time for the weird and [Music] wonderful so doing the other things then are dining table dining chairs B and we had a very productive time at the furniture shop finding all of them oh ah this one looks padded like it o this is the moment we realized swivel was an absolute must for us even for a dining chair oh oh my God yeah that's incredible I feel like we found something in this that we did not know we wanted like the idea of this rotating dining chair anytime someone talks on a table you're looking at them now in order to have a swiveling dining chair we also needed to make sure that we found table legs that were high enough so the chairs don't get stuck and tucked away enough that your legs aren't banging into them as you move around o i quite like the angular ones plus we also found our Dream table top to go with it hey what the I love the feel of it I love how thin it is the legs don't interfere for me it's made by a company called reflex and what I found absolutely fascinating about it is that it looks like marble but it's actually tempered glass thanks to a printing technique that they've developed and that has two major benefits they can make it way thinner and they can add this frosted matte finish which seemingly makes it pick up zero fingerprints do you mind if we grab one of those moving chairs this could be the perfect combination are we getting it yeah we're getting full rotation look at that so that's our table our base and all dining chairs locked in but there is scope to add swivel to one more product this is far beyond what I expected from a bar stool I've used bar stools before but they do not have the cushioning of this the stitching of this the piping of this and it's when you sit on it it just ah I don't think we're going to get better than this what do you think yeah okay let's do it now this was surprisingly the most fun room to put together so far cuz this is where it really dawned on us that this is going to be our kitchen that we cook every meal in every day that for the first time we could optimize every single micro aspect of it perfectly for us everything down to the theme we wanted to create the perfect little reading look the programming of the lights to be able to create the exact scenes we wanted and so I am buzzing to show you the final product welcome to the dream kitchen today we find out what is the absolute best kitchen Tech in the world through a combination of things that we've already tested very thoroughly and things that we're about to test together now starting with this I've seen people raving about this ninja slushy machine probably once a week for the last 8 weeks on social media but then equally that's never stopped us eventually finding that something is still a stupid idea so we got one we set it up and the idea is that you can put anything in here so long as it's got some sugar in it so I'm actually going to say something Rogue here but Red Bull is probably my favorite tasting drink ever so can this preserve that flavor while actually making the texture even better be so cool if it's also able to keep its Fizz although judging by the amount of effervescence in here I'm guessing it won't whoa okay this is really exciting but now right next to that is the Nugget edible ice machine that we bought earlier the way that we planned this kitchen out is this is one of LG's signature wine buets we got it with the house but you know there's only so much wine two people can drink so it's actually also kind of the perfect place to store everything you'd need for a cocktail or a mocktail so then that makes this the ideal place to store the two gadgets related two drinks but there's a dilemma with this one because when we first bought the house and we were deciding what gadgets to get for it we didn't have a fridge here but then in the process of trying to find the best fridge we ended up with this the LG instav view the key thing for me just being that it's very space efficient you can store stuff right up until the edges I do find it really funny though that their entire marketing and product name centers around how you can knock to see what's inside this one section like gee I wish there was a fast way of seeing what's inside a fridge but my point was that this like many fridges nowadays has an ice machine baked in this is clearly the easier option it has a filter on the inside and even disinfects its nozzle each day with ultraviolet light so is nugget ice from this machine here so good that it's worth buying and keeping around this extra pretty bulky machine okay so water goes in the top here so apparently if I just click quick start it's going to start Ching out ice in 4 minutes which needs to be tested and so what it's doing right now is freezing but also combining that frozen water with air to create a lighter more textured Ice Cube something's just dropped into here but we are 5 minutes 30 in so feeling a little misled oh it kind of looks like the thing ate too much Indian food last night been 19 minutes and we now have a sizable portion of nugget ice that was Dreadful and they normal fridge ice okay aesthetically I actually don't think that looks any better okay so you add water to normal ice then water to the Sonic ice it practically disappears on the inside it's just not appetizing is it it kind of looks like I've stuck a load of cotton wool inside my glass now for the big question is it more pleas to ingest doesn't stop you getting brain freeze that's for sure it just tastes like crushed ice not impressed does that mean I have to chew [Music] this there is a difference but there's only a difference if you decide that you're going to eat your ice at which point if this is a 9.5 out of 10 on the Pain Scale then this is still an eight all right well this was actually a fairly easy decision you get a three out of 10 on the bright side though this looks completely transformed like not in the slightest bit like Red Bull anymore which is both very exciting and concerning this is a pretty big moment whoa why does everything look like it's taking a dump today that's actually pretty slick I have to say so one thing I can tell it's only been sitting here for 30 seconds but the liquid has separated to the bottom mhm oh my God yeah that's the stuff it looks like just really dry ice with all the liquid at the bottom but this is actually melt in your mouth perfectly shaped deliciousness and whether this is because it was originally a fizzy drink or not it tastes fizzy it's that kind of micro I texture fair play deserves the hype that is a 9.5 out of 10 now onto the other side I don't think we quite appreciated when we first got the house how crazy useful it is that it's been pre-fitted with two identical self-drying dishwashers right next to each other so originally we bought a dish rack to keep up here but actually having two of these means that we don't even need that because there's always one dishwasher that's ready to load used dishes into and one that makes sure that we've always got clean stuff ready and then for the few things that are just too big for the dishwashers you just hand wash them and you put them on this which we got from Joseph Joseph and it's such a clean little drying system but cabinet 2 is the breakfast area we decided that it's the most efficient route to get bread from the fridge put it into your toaster and then work your way straight to the dining table but which toaster I think this is going to be such an interesting battle because these are both basically the most expensive toasters you can get but they both do this toasting in completely opposite ways so let's solve this once and for all which is the best Toaster in the world so the Bal Mudder is the way simpler machine you put your bread in you turn it on you set a timer and you let it cook with the one twist being that you can also fill it up with water which coats the bread in a fine mist and then because water heats up faster than air it makes the outside crispy in the inside fluffy the revolution Pro is well it's definitely the more customizable toaster so there's like 20 30 different types of bread you can pick which ones show up and what order they're in you pick whether you're starting from fresh or frozen and then even what toastiness level you like oh my God the image actually changes depending on what you select so you can preview what your toast is going to look like not to mention you can do paninis with this accessory and even becomes a warming rack using this one okay let's set it to a perfect free there we go 3 2 one go a oh that is so slick now I got to say between the two the balmuda looks prettier and also we've only used this revolution like twice and the entire finish is covered in fingerprints it's just really hard to keep clean but then Counterpoint it does also have a removable crumb tray and is even smart enough to tell you when it's full so you know when to remove it whereas the bow mood is probably going to be a little higher maintenance wait what think 5 Seconds To Go are you kidding me wow that said while I am a great appreciator of speed that doesn't look anything alike like if you're going to go as far as to program what every stage of bread should look like shouldn't you first prioritizing making sure you can actually make the bread look like that okay so that took nearly three times as long but tell me that is not a more professional looking piece of toast I'm not exaggerating when I say I think the Bal muda's toast looks vastly more appetizing let's bust them up it's the best part of my day this is a pretty average slice of toast it's got a little bit of crisp on the outside but it's also quite doughy inoffensive but forgettable oh got to make sure I eat an equal amount of this toast you know just just to keep it fair every time I compare the Bal muda to something else I have the exact same reaction it's just better every time I take a slice of toast out of that baluda my first impression is is damn that's really hard but it's designed that way so that when you add a little bit of butter it softens it to the point where it is perfect whereas that butter normally makes every other piece of toast a little too soft okay so there's two slices of toast in front of you can you taste them one by one and tell me which one you think is better they're very different [Music] colors oh I don't know [Music] oh you're getting thre a lot of bread to make this decision this is a better done toast this is this kind of feels like bread with butter o skaing yeah off we go you toast mate cabinet 3 is the lunch/dinner area hence the microwave which has actually been really good for us but it's a microwave we don't need to dwell on that got to say though one of the coolest things about this kitchen is that it not just has these hidden cabinets that you can make disappear when you close the doors but also that every single one of these cabinets has four main sockets so that we can keep every single appliance that we want to use permanently plugged in ready to go without clutching the main island which as you can see brings me great joy oh yeah in terms of the smaller bits in this kitchen by the way so we bought our dining equipment from a company called fabal and it's been amazing nothing has any seams for things to get stuck in everything cleans in one swipe it's completely scratchproof and it's fine in the dishwasher we also got our glasses from the same Fable company because know me you know I cannot resist bezeless things and these are probably the thinnest glasses I've ever used while being a lot stronger than they look it's also just a really efficient form factor because you're not carrying any extra weight and your liquid literally starts from the very bottom cookware wise we settled on carway in the end these things are like nonstick to another level they look beautiful and you can also tell that this is a company who thinks about the little things like for example how they ship them with the magnetic holders that you need to store them this thing has been an absolute GameChanger it's a strainer that keeps your pasta or rice completely upright so that you can just pour away the water and then let it sit without leaking and then these are the man Kitchen Salt and Pepper cannons which to my disappointment don't actually launch your pepper across the room but the level of control you get here is insane most normal meals can grind between 12 to 28 mesh size this can do 8 to 60 okay so that's drinks that's breakfast that's lunch and dinner all done well now it's time for my favorite automation candl light mode so let's do it it makes the blinds come down it turns off all the room lights except the one right over the dining table and it makes all of the Phillips Hues that we've hidden around the room go to this lovely warm orange color so cool and that feels like a pretty good leading to dessert so this is the Ninja creamy it is their ice cream machine and even though this one isn't as viral as the slushy machine my prediction is that this is going to be the underdog so here's my problem every night like the moment I finish eating dinner my body switches modes and suddenly just starts craving dessert and so the thing that I'm most curious about is if I put into this just the standard ingredients that I use to make a fairly healthy chocolate protein shake so this is just chocolate protein powder and milk can this turn that into an actually tasty ice cream so you start by ejecting canister and then you place in your prefrozen ingredients so in a sense there is a little bit of prep cuz you have to do this the night [Music] before this is actually just w most expensive ASMR machine I feel like I want some crunch in here oh oats pretty healthy serving of that so you get three options over here and then ice cream oh my God it's going to take 2 minutes is that [Music] [Applause] it now as you can probably tell this is not the cleanest video we've ever filmed but the reason that my face looks this unbothered is because of what we have here so we specifically asked robor Rock if they were willing to sponsor this video because their Q Revo slim is the smartest robot cleaner I have ever used like the navigation on this thing is bordering on self-driving car levels it's absolutely surrounded in 3D sensors that are all upgraded and all work together to form what they call the starsight autonomous system and that means that this robot deeply understands your room for example with any other Robot vacuum cleaner before letting them go you have to first pick up any obstacles you know a clump of cables or some shoes you left around this robot is so so aware that it will not just avoid those obstacles wow but it will identify them it can recognize 73 different floor objects and it will mark them on the virtual map that it builds of your room so you know what it avoided and it knows that those objects are temporary so they won't affect its understanding of a room unlike something more permanent like a dining table would it gets better though because it's incredibly thin and the mop and the side brush are extendable now so it can fit under pretty much anything and it can can also clean right up until the very Corners so long story short we have set up one of these on every floor of the house they send themselves out to clean while we're asleep they head back to the dock on their own when they're done cleaning they empty their own dust bin they power wash their own mop we don't really do anything anymore so link below to check it out and now final few finishing touches that take this from a great kitchen into a dream kitchen so the first is simple human so I have used a couple of products from this simple human company in the past but it's actually getting more of them setting them up properly in our own space that has given me a whole new appreciation for this company so here's how I would describe these products they're not cheap they strongly incentivize you to lock yourself into the simple human ecosystem but while do they make your life easier if you're willing to put up with that so for example this simple human bin from the very first interaction it's thoughtless you just walk up to it and a sensor in front of it will make it open there's a pod up here perfect example of something they want you to keep buying from them but something that's also very effective at making your trash just smell like 90% fresh Citrus basically oh and by the way for the remaining 10% we got the Bri 2 Pro air filter which is pound-for-pound not the best air filter you can get and the app is pretty unreliable but then when you factor in how much it suits the aesthetic of the room and how it also acts as the scent diffuser using essential oils I think it's worth it so then let's say your trash is full they've made every part of the process easy you pull out these pretty rip proof bags you pull the tags to fasten those bags and then to put a new bag in you don't need to go go rummage around under your sink you just reach inside you grab said new bag and these simple human bags even let you know when you're running low with a QR code that lets you order new ones to arrive just in time before they actually run out from you guessed it simplehuman.com see what I mean about the ecosystem now I'd actually go as far as to say that their paper towel holder though is even better so the paper towel goes on the outside feet Regina Blitz if you know you know it's held in place by this arm so it doesn't actually matter how much you've got left and this bottle that sits on the inside it works even better than I expected it to what an insanely intelligent solution to bundle together two products that often need to go together anyway but then equally they will try and sell you on their surface cleaning tablets too which you mix with water to form the solution that goes in here but you can just fill it up with anything but my number one favorite product from these guys has actually ended up being these sensor pumps I was initially worried about buying another Gadget that needs to be charged and also filled up with soap every now and again but we've had like 2 months of heavy usage and we haven't had to do either and it saves so much hassle while cleaning to just be able to wash your dishes with this and wash your hands like this and then of course take off the lid and this is how you order your refills so on brand right it looks like my protein shake has been creamed what did he say now we did have to run this a few times because I think at the beginning the mixture was so rock solid that the blades inside of this couldn't actually cut through wow look at this that Scoops up so nicely there's a little bit of roughness to it I'm hoping that's my oats as opposed to it being icy oh yeah this is actually a game changer I could actually steal myself every night going forward pre- making myself one of these and having a post dinner but actually guilt-free treat it's also not crazy messy like all we have to clean afterwards is one two this video was actually just an excuse to eat you know when I first saw this creamy machine and the slushy machine online the very first thing that popped into my mind was surely that's pointless cuz you see so many gadgets like this like that bartisan that I reviewed a while back where all the work is actually being done by the capsules or the preparation you have to do beforehand and the Machine is just a glorified mixer but that's not the case with either of these the end product would be almost impossible to achieve otherwise oh I think this is a 10 and then the final thing is just we got really lucky with this kitchen it's designed for 10 people to be able to prep food at the same time without bumping into each other it's got one surface that we have to keep clean there's no walls that you can backsplash onto there's no handles on anything that you can get caught in your clothing and so knowing that we had such a good base the biggest thing on our mind was just how do we build the things we want into this without interfering with it like we wanted plants so we've put those quite far back we wanted smart Philips Hue lighting and so we found ways of weaving that into this main island without adding obstru instuctions we got the Samsung frame TV as well here to add to the earthy green fresh theme that we've been trying to create but the box that you need to control the thing we put it inside the wall so that you can't see a thing and that makes this for us the dream kitchen Beyond a dream really this is just wow really so I will catch you in the Next Room hint I will be heavily relying on that one especially over Christmas time"

on suppressed inventions, we discussed some of the most
groundbreaking technologies, from Nikola Tesla's
discovery of free energy to the mysterious circumstances
surrounding the demise of Stanley Meyer's water-powered car. In this second part, we'll continue with
presenting inventions that, for various reasons ranging
from corporate interests to governmental interventions, never made it to the public eye, pushed into obscurity despite their potential
to revolutionize our world. Cavity Structural Effect. Viktor Grebennikov was a self-taught
entomologist from Russia. His journey into the unknown began with a fascination
for the natural world, particularly the insect kingdom, which he believed held secrets
to extraordinary powers, including anti-gravity. The cornerstone
of Grebennikov's discovery was the Cavity
Structural Effect (CSE), a concept he derived from closely observing
the structure of bee nests and the behavior of insects. It all started in the early 1980s while Grebennikov was camping
in the vast Siberian steppe. While laying on the ground, he suddenly experienced
an unusual sensation, only to find out he was lying
atop an underground bee city. He experienced headaches, ringing ears,
and a metallic taste in his mouth, which sparked his interest
in the peculiarities of the natural structures around him. Delving deeper into this phenomenon, Grebennikov
collected parts of the bee nest and began experimenting. He observed
an unusual heat emanation from the honeycomb structures, a sensation that could not be
detected or measured by conventional
scientific instruments. This observation led him to theorize
about the existence of a force field generated by the geometric
configuration of the honeycombs, a field capable of influencing
the surrounding environment in ways not previously understood by science. Grebennikov's investigations
took a significant turn when he examined the chitin shells
of insects under a microscope. He discovered an ""unusually rhythmic,
extremely ordered"" structure that seemed to defy gravity. When he attempted to place
two of these chitin plates together, one plate hovered in the air
for a few seconds before aligning itself with the other. This observation was the first step toward understanding
the anti-gravitational properties of certain natural structures. Convinced of the potential
of his discovery, Grebennikov embarked on a project to harness the Cavity
Structural Effect for human use. He constructed a platform with thousands of chitin shells
attached to its underside, creating what he claimed
was an anti-gravity vehicle. According to Grebennikov, this vehicle could travel at speeds
of up to 1,500 kilometers per hour and reach heights
of 300 meters off the ground. More astonishingly, the device supposedly made
the rider invisible from below and encased them
in a bubble-like force field that nullified inertia
and dynamic pressure. Despite the incredible claims and the profound implications
of his work, Grebennikov faced
skepticism and rejection from the scientific community. After his patent application
in 1992 was denied, Grebennikov attempted to share
his groundbreaking work through a book. This publication
was intended to detail his discovery, outlining the principles and
mechanisms behind his invention, supplemented by
a wealth of full-color images and potentially including photographs from a museum demonstration
of his device. However, in a turn of events
that raises questions about the motives
behind the decision, the publishers, potentially influenced
by external pressures, significantly altered the book
just before its release. This involved the removal
of hundreds of images and all schematic details that were crucial for understanding
Grebennikov's work. This situation begs the question: Why was Grebennikov, already under scrutiny
and skepticism from his peers, subjected to further efforts that seemed to undermine
the evidence of his invention? A longtime colleague of Grebennikov
suggested that he was part of a so-called
scientific underground, which faced opposition
and perhaps even persecution from the established
scientific community and government bodies. Perhaps, then, Grebennikov's inadvertent discovery was more profound
and potentially disruptive than initially thought. It could be that his work
touched upon a force or technology so significant
that it was deemed too dangerous or too powerful to be allowed
into the public domain, prompting efforts
to bury his findings and silence the discussion
around them. The Hemp Car. In the 1940s, amidst the turmoil of World War II
and the rise of the industrial era, Henry Ford embarked
on a groundbreaking project that diverged significantly from the automotive norms
of his time. Known for his innovative spirit and the revolutionary assembly
line production of the Model T, Ford turned his attention
towards environmental sustainability long before it became
a global concern. His vision materialized
in the form of a car that was not only powered
by biomass fuel but was also constructed from it, with hemp
being the primary material. - A new idea from Ford, Ford 420,
the new car made from weed! How can cops stop you
for the possession of drugs when your car
is made entirely out of it? - This initiative, while pioneering, found itself in the shadows, eclipsed by
the dominant petroleum industry which was rapidly expanding
its global footprint. Ford's interest
in renewable resources and sustainable materials was not a sudden revelation. He had long advocated for the integration
of agriculture with industry, believing that farms could serve as a vital source of raw materials
for manufacturing. The concept of the Hemp Car was a direct manifestation
of this belief, showcasing Ford's commitment to exploring alternative
materials and fuels. The car's body was made
from a composite material that included hemp fibers, which, when combined
with other plant fibers, resulted in a lightweight, durable,
and biodegradable product. This material was not only
environmentally friendly but also boasted a tensile strength
reportedly ten times that of steel, offering significant safety benefits
alongside its ecological advantages. Moreover, the Hemp Car
was designed to run on hemp biofuel, derived from the seeds
of the cannabis plant. This choice of fuel
was emblematic of Ford's vision for a future where automobiles
would not be reliant on non-renewable energy sources. The use of hemp biofuel
presented a sustainable, clean-burning alternative
to gasoline, promising a reduction
in harmful emissions and a move towards
greater energy independence. The public unveiling
of the Hemp Car in 1941 was a spectacle that drew
considerable attention. Ford demonstrated
the resilience of the car's body through a sledgehammer test, where the material withstood blows
without showing signs of damage, a testament to its
remarkable durability. Despite the innovative features and the environmental benefits
of the Hemp Car, the project did not progress
beyond its initial demonstration. The reasons for this are manifold, with the prevailing
petroleum interests of the time playing a significant role. The mid-20th century marked
a period of rapid expansion for the oil industry, with petroleum becoming
the lifeblood of the global economy. This shift towards
oil-based energy sources created an environment where
alternative fuels and materials, such as those proposed by Ford, faced significant obstacles in terms of acceptance
and implementation. The economic and political clout
of the petroleum industry, coupled with its strategic importance, meant that initiatives
like the Hemp Car were sidelined. The legal and cultural
landscape of the time also contributed
to the project's demise, with hemp cultivation
facing increasing restrictions due to its association with psychoactive strains
of cannabis. These factors, combined with
the onset of World War II and the subsequent shift
in industrial priorities, led to the Hemp Car project
being largely forgotten. The Radiant Energy Device. In the 1930s, a period marked by
scientific breakthroughs and the burgeoning
of modern physics, an inventor named T. Henry Moray introduced a device that he claimed could harness
the boundless energy of the cosmos. This Radiant Energy Device,
as Moray described it, was purported to tap into
the unseen forces of the universe, offering a limitless
source of power that could potentially revolutionize the way
humanity generated and used energy. However,
despite its promising premise, Moray's invention
was met with skepticism, discreditation,
and even sabotage, leading to a contentious chapter in the history of
alternative energy research. Moray, an electrical engineer
and physicist from Salt Lake City, Utah, was deeply influenced by
the pioneering work of Nikola Tesla and other scientists
who explored the frontiers of electromagnetism
and radioactivity. Drawing on these influences, Moray theorized
that the space around us is filled with a form of energy that, if properly harnessed, could provide
an inexhaustible power source. His device, which he began developing
in the early 1920s, aimed to convert this cosmic energy
into electrical power, using a complex arrangement
of semiconductors, capacitors, and other electrical components. The core of Moray's invention
was a special valve, a semiconductive material
that he claimed could absorb radiant energy
from the environment and convert it
into high-voltage electricity. This process,
according to Moray, did not violate
the laws of thermodynamics, as it merely converted
existing energy from one form to another. He demonstrated his device
on numerous occasions, reportedly powering
lights, radios, and motors in front of witnesses without any apparent
external power source. Despite these demonstrations, the scientific community remained
largely skeptical of Moray's claims. Critics argued
that the device's operation and the theory behind it were not adequately
explained or documented in a manner that could be
independently verified or replicated. The lack of a clear
theoretical framework that aligned with established physics further fueled skepticism, as did Moray's reluctance to disclose
the full details of his invention, citing concerns over
intellectual property and the potential for misuse. The situation
was further complicated by allegations of sabotage
and persecution. Moray reported that his work
had attracted the attention of powerful interests who sought
to suppress his invention, fearing its impact
on the existing energy sector. He claimed to have been threatened, his laboratory ransacked, and his equipment damaged
in attempts to halt his research. As the years passed, Moray continued to refine his device
and advocate for its potential, but he was unable to secure
the support needed to bring his invention to fruition. After Moray's death, his invention faded into obscurity, remembered more
as a curious footnote in the annals of alternative energy than as the revolutionary
breakthrough he had envisioned. Perpetual Motion. Viktor Schauberger,
an Austrian forester, naturalist, and inventor, spent a significant portion of his life studying the dynamics
of water flow and natural energy. Born in 1885, Schauberger's observations
of the natural world led him to develop
theories and inventions that many have since associated
with the concept of perpetual motion, a principle proposing a machine or
system that can operate indefinitely without an external source
of energy. It's crucial to note, however, that Schauberger himself
never claimed to have developed perpetual motion machines. Instead, his focus was on
understanding and utilizing the ""natural power"" of the Earth, particularly vortices in water flow, which he believed could be harnessed
for beneficial purposes. Schauberger's approach
was deeply rooted in his observation of nature. He believed that modern
technology and engineering ignored the harmonious principles
found in natural systems, which, according to him, could lead to energy generation without the cost
of environmental degradation. His famous aphorism, ""Understand nature,
then copy nature,"" reflects the core of his philosophy. Schauberger argued that water, when allowed to flow in a vortex, could create its own energy
through implosion, a concept that stood in contrast
to the explosion-based technologies like combustion engines, which dominate human technology. One of Schauberger's
most notable contributions was his research
into vortex dynamics. He observed that water
in rivers and streams, naturally follows
a meandering, spiral path, and posited that this motion
is essential for maintaining the water's vitality and energy. By mimicking these patterns, Schauberger invented several devices intended to produce
energy or propulsion. His Repulsine, for example, was a saucer-shaped machine
designed to generate propulsion through a series of specially designed
wave-like patterns that would create a vortex of air or water. This device captured
the imagination of many, leading to speculation
that Schauberger had unlocked the secrets
of perpetual motion and free energy. His work attracted the attention of
the Nazi regime during World War II, and there are accounts
of him being coerced into developing his inventions
for military use, an experience that
reportedly left him disillusioned and wary of the potential misuse
of his discoveries. After the war,
Schauberger continued his research, but his inventions never achieved
the commercial success or scientific recognition
he hoped for. The controversy surrounding
Schauberger's work intensified after he was taken into custody
by US intelligence agents and held for 9 months. During this period, all of his documents and prototypes
were confiscated, and he was interrogated
about his inventions and his activities during the war. This episode has fueled
speculation suggesting that Schauberger's innovations
in harnessing natural energies were of such potential that they were considered a threat
to the established scientific, economic, and political order, leading to their alleged suppression
by the US government. Coral Castle. Coral Castle
is an oolitic limestone structure located in Homestead, Florida, and stands as one of the most
mysterious architectural feats of the 20th century. Created single-handedly
by Edward Leedskalnin from 1923 to 1951, this monumental structure
weighs approximately 1,100 tons. The technology behind Coral Castle, as well as the techniques
employed by Leedskalnin, remain subjects
of speculation and intrigue, with theories ranging
from ancient sciences to unknown forms of energy. Edward Leedskalnin's early life
was marked by profound heartbreak, after he was rejected
by his 16-year-old fiancée in Latvia. He then embarked
on a journey to the United States, where he was later diagnosed
with terminal tuberculosis. Remarkably, however, he claimed to have cured himself
using magnets, which also marked the beginning
of the mysterious construction of Coral Castle. He began to build
what he initially called ""Rock Gate Park,"" dedicating it
to the lost love of his life. Leedskalnin, who stood just over 5 feet tall
and weighed only 100 pounds, worked alone,
mostly at night, so no one could see his methods. He claimed to have discovered
the secrets of the pyramids, which allowed him to move
and carve massive stones. The stones used in the construction
are massive, with some blocks
weighing as much as 30 tons. Stunningly, local teenagers who claimed to
have seen Leedskalnin work at night described how they observed
the massive stones moving as if manipulated by some
supernatural force. Many speculated that he employed some form of ancient
technology or knowledge that has since been lost to time. Leedskalnin was secretive
about his methods, but he did offer some clues. He suggested that he understood
the laws of weight and leverage well, and photographs from the time show him using tripods
made from timber. However, these tools
seem insufficient for the task, leading to theories that Leedskalnin
had a deep understanding of magnetic forces and used this knowledge
to lift and move the stones. One popular theory
about Coral Castle's construction involves the use
of electromagnetic energy or Earth's magnetic field. Leedskalnin published several
pamphlets on magnetic currents, indicating his deep interest and possible reliance
on magnetic forces for the construction of Coral Castle. He believed that all matter
consisted of individual magnets and that this inherent magnetism could be harnessed to achieve
seemingly impossible feats. - So if you reverse the magnet forces with a force of some kind
of electromagnetic radio, perhaps, frequency, you can then make these rocks
not as heavy as they seem otherwise
and therefore you can lift them. - Another theory suggests that
Leedskalnin used acoustic levitation, a method that uses sound waves
to lift and move objects. Some researchers propose that by tuning into the resonance
frequency of the stones, Leedskalnin could have
made them easier to move. This theory is supported
by ancient legends and modern experiments that
demonstrate the potential of sound to manipulate physical objects. Despite these theories, no definitive evidence has been found to conclusively explain how
Leedskalnin constructed Coral Castle. The secrecy surrounding his methods
and the lack of eyewitnesses have only deepened the mystery. Today, Coral Castle serves as a museum
and tourist attraction, drawing visitors
from around the world who are fascinated by its history
and the mystery of its construction. The technology behind Coral Castle remains one of the great unsolved
mysteries of the modern world. The WASP X-Jet. The quest for innovative
Vertical Take Off and Landing, VTOL systems has led to numerous
experimental designs, one of the most intriguing
being the Williams X-Jet. Developed by Williams International, a company recognized
for its engineering prowess in turbofan technology, the X-Jet emerged
as a groundbreaking VTOL system. Also known as
The Williams Aerial Systems Platform, or the WASP, this compact, lightweight aircraft was powered
by a turbofan aircraft engine, showcasing a blend of simplicity
and advanced engineering that set it apart from other
VTOL concepts of its time. It was designed
to carry a single operator who could control the aircraft by simply leaning in
the desired direction of travel and adjusting the power. This intuitive control mechanism, combined with the X-Jet's agility, allowed for movements
in any direction, rapid acceleration, hovering,
and rotation on its axis. The aircraft boasted
an impressive capability to stay aloft for up to 45 minutes, reaching speeds
of up to 60 miles per hour, making it an exceptional vehicle
for personal transportation. Despite its innovative
design and capabilities, the Williams X-Jet's journey
was not without challenges. In the 1980s, the U.S. Army evaluated the X-Jet
as part of its ongoing exploration of new VTOL technologies. The military's interest
in such systems was driven by the potential
for enhanced mobility and flexibility on the battlefield, beyond what conventional helicopters
and fixed-wing aircraft could offer. The X-Jet presented
an intriguing option for individual soldier mobility. However,
after thorough evaluation, the U.S. Army concluded
that the Williams X-Jet, while innovative, was inferior to the capabilities
provided by helicopters and small unmanned aircraft. The decision was based
on several factors, including the X-Jet's limited range
and payload capacity compared to helicopters
and the rapidly advancing technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which offered greater versatility
without risking a pilot's life. Additionally, the operational complexities
and training requirements for safely piloting the X-Jet presented logistical challenges for its integration
into military operations. Although this technology
wasn't suppressed and it would be an improvement
in people's daily life, it wasn't utilized
as it was too expensive and relatively hard to fly. The exploration of VTOL technology
continues to evolve, with new designs
and concepts emerging that build upon
the foundational work of projects like the Williams X-Jet. The Cloudbuster. Although we already talked about
Wilhelm Reich's orgone accumulator, the healing device that used
orgone energy to cure many people, this wasn't the only invention
made by Reich. His interest in orgone energy led him to believe that this energy could be harnessed
for various purposes, including
the manipulation of weather. According to Reich, orgone energy was present
throughout the atmosphere and could be
concentrated and directed to dissolve cloud formations, thereby inducing rainfall. The Cloudbuster device,
developed in the 1950s, was the practical application
of his theories. It consisted
of a set of hollow tubes connected to cables
that were immersed in water, which Reich claimed could draw
orgone energy from the atmosphere and direct it to disperse
cloud cover or, conversely, to form clouds and precipitate rain. Reich conducted several experiments
with the Cloudbuster, claiming successes
in rainmaking in various locations, including a well-documented
experiment at a blueberry farm in Maine, where he alleged
to have broken a drought and saved the crop. These experiments
attracted attention, not all of which was positive. Critics dismissed Reich's claims, citing a lack of scientific rigor
and reproducible results, while supporters hailed
the potential of the Cloudbuster to address drought
and other weather-related challenges. The legal and governmental challenges faced by Reich and his
Cloudbuster project were, in part, a consequence
of the broader controversy surrounding his work
on orgone energy. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) initiated an investigation
into Reich's practices, particularly his claims regarding
the health benefits of orgone energy and the use of orgone accumulators – devices designed to concentrate
and harness orgone energy for therapeutic purposes. The FDA's scrutiny
extended to the Cloudbuster as part of its broader campaign
against Reich's orgonomic research. In 1956, following a series
of legal battles, Reich was sentenced to prison
for contempt of court, related to his refusal to comply with an injunction
against the distribution of orgone-related materials. The controversy surrounding
the Cloudbuster was thus intertwined with the wider
legal actions against Reich, which culminated in the destruction
of his publications and orgone accumulators
by the FDA – an act that has been
described by some as a dark moment in the annals
of scientific censorship. The Original Electric Car. The tale of the General Motors EV1, the world's first
mass-produced electric car, is a clear example of the suppression
of emerging technologies due to industrial interests. Launched in the late 1990s, the EV1 represented
a bold foray into electric mobility, a glimpse into a future
where automobiles no longer relied on fossil fuels. However, the journey of the EV1
was abruptly halted, sparking debates
that continue to resonate today, especially in the context
of the 2006 documentary, ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" The EV1 emerged
from General Motors as a pioneering effort
to address the growing concerns over air pollution, oil dependency, and the environmental impact
of conventional vehicles. With 800 units available for lease, the EV1 quickly garnered
a dedicated following, appreciated for its
innovation, efficiency, and the statement it made
about the potential for a cleaner automotive future. Yet, despite the enthusiasm
it generated among a niche group
of environmentally conscious drivers, General Motors announced
the end of the EV1 line in 1999, a mere few years
after its introduction. Their cause for discontinuing the EV1
centered on economic considerations, primarily the limited driving range
of the car's batteries, which they argued
made the vehicle unprofitable to produce and maintain. According to General Motors, the technology at the time
could not meet consumer expectations for range and convenience, making the EV1
a challenging proposition for widespread adoption. However, this explanation
did not satisfy many observers. Skeptics and supporters of the EV speculated that there were
other forces at play, specifically the influence
of the oil industry. The argument goes
that oil companies, whose business model relies
on the continued dominance of internal combustion
engine vehicles, viewed the advent
of electric cars like the EV as a direct threat to their profits
and market position. According to this perspective, pressure from these
powerful interests led General Motors
to not only discontinue the EV but also to take extraordinary
measures to erase its existence. A policy was issued by General Motors
to hunt and destroy every last EV1. Rather than allowing
the leased vehicles to remain with their
enthusiastic users or preserving them
as part of automotive history, General Motors systematically
retrieved and crushed the EV1s, effectively ensuring
that the technology would not advance
beyond its prototype stage. This decision
has been interpreted by many as an attempt
to stifle the development of electric vehicle technology, keeping it from challenging
the status quo of the automotive market. Today, as electric vehicles gain increasing
market share and acceptance, the story of the EV1, with all its controversy and mystery, underscores the notion
that the path to progress is often unplugged and uncertain. Project XA. The story of Dr James D. Mold
and his cancer-free cigarettes is one that would incense
every smoker and every person
who has lost a loved one due to the effects
of tobacco smoking. The history of cigarette advertising and the tobacco industry's practices regarding the disclosure
of health risks is a controversial chapter. It's a well known fact
that for decades, tobacco companies engaged
in aggressive advertising campaigns that not only promoted smoking as a
desirable and socially acceptable habit but also employed tactics that downplayed or outright denied the health risks
associated with smoking. One of the most notorious aspects
of these campaigns was the use of advertisements
that featured doctors or implied medical endorsement, creating a misleading narrative
about the safety of cigarettes. In the early to mid-20th century, cigarette advertisements
were ubiquitous, appearing in magazines,
newspapers, billboards, and later on television. These ads were designed
to appeal to a broad audience, including women, men,
and even teenagers, using various themes
such as glamour, masculinity, sophistication,
and stress relief. Starting in the 1950s, research began to shed light on the
detrimental health effects of smoking, but tobacco companies
fought vigorously to discredit these findings. They funded their own research to create doubt
about the health risks, embarked on
public relations campaigns to maintain
the social acceptability of smoking, and lobbied politicians
to prevent or weaken regulation. This leads us to 1955 when a scientist
named Dr. James D. Mold embarked on groundbreaking
research with Liggett & Myers, a tobacco company
based in North Carolina. Tasked with identifying carcinogenic
components in cigarette smoke, Mold's research
focused on substances that caused cancer
in laboratory mice. This endeavor
led to the inception of Project XA, a bold initiative
aimed at creating a safer cigarette by eliminating or reducing
these harmful ingredients. Project XA represented
a significant departure from traditional
cigarette manufacturing. Mold, with support from Liggett and collaboration
with the A.D. Little Company, dedicated himself
to developing a cigarette that wouldn't contribute to cancer. After 25 years of rigorous
research and development, Mold introduced the XA, also known as
the palladium cigarette. This innovative product utilized
palladium and magnesium nitrate to neutralize cancer-causing
substances in cigarette smoke. Laboratory tests confirmed
the efficacy of these cigarettes in reducing cancer incidence
among lab animals, marking a potential breakthrough
in tobacco product safety. However, despite the initial
backing from Liggett, the project encountered
insurmountable obstacles. The company's executives,
influenced by legal counsel, decided to withdraw support
for Project XA. The lawyers argued
that introducing a safer cigarette could expose the company
to a deluge of lawsuits from consumers harmed
by their traditional products. This legal concern effectively halted
the progress of Project XA, forcing Mold to abandon
over two decades of work. Liggett's directive to Mold
to keep his findings unpublished ensured that the public
remained unaware of the potential for safer cigarettes, leaving the health risks of conventional tobacco products
unaddressed. Another reason
the palladium cigarette never made it to the shelves
was because Liggett didn't want to break ranks
with other tobacco giants like Phillip Morris. Although the company knew that the product would be
commercially viable and marketable, they were more worried
about the potential retaliation from other tobacco companies
in the industry. The cessation of Project XA, after an investment
of approximately $10 million, underscores a troubling chapter
in the history of tobacco research. Worse still, Liggett and other tobacco giants continued to sell
cancer-causing cigarettes, even though they were
fully aware of the health risks associated with what they sold. The Hendershot Generator. Lester Hendershot
was an American inventor in the late 1920s, claimed to have developed a device
capable of generating free energy. The Hendershot Generator,
as it came to be known, was said to harness
the Earth's magnetic field to produce electricity
without the need for fuel. This remarkable invention
had the potential to revolutionize
the world's energy landscape, offering an unlimited source
of power that could render traditional energy sources obsolete. Lester Hendershot's invention was
described as a self-running generator, a device that
purportedly created energy through a series
of coils and capacitors without the need
for an external power source. Hendershot's demonstrations
of the device in the late 1920s reportedly showed it
powering light bulbs and motors, captivating
the imagination of the public and drawing the attention of both
the media and potential investors. Despite the initial excitement, a strong campaign to undermine
his technology was underway, with some detractors going as far
as publicly demonstrating a device they claimed was Hendershot's, attempting to prove
its ineffectiveness. This act of discreditation
signaled to Hendershot's supporters that there were concerted efforts
to undermine his work. Undeterred, Hendershot persisted
with his free energy generator for many years. By the late 1960s, he believed he had a breakthrough
that would interest the US Navy, preparing two models
and a detailed 56-page proposal. Nevertheless,
his proposal was denied. In April 1961, as Hendershot's son
was returning from school, he found his father dead. Officially recorded as a suicide, the absence of a thorough
investigation led many, including his family, to suspect foul play, theorizing that his innovative work posed a significant threat
to large energy corporations. Rumors circulated that Hendershot had been warned
by a major corporation, which he declined to name, to cease all work
related to his generator, underlining the potential disruption his invention could cause
to their lucrative business. Allegedly, Hendershot accepted $25,000 under the condition he halted
his research for two decades. He had expressed fears
for his safety to his family, indicating the gravity
of the threats he faced. Hendershot's death
and the suppression of his invention continue to provoke deep questions. The discussion of all of these
suppressed inventions we showed you, is both enlightening
and disheartening, revealing how these innovations
intersect with power and greed. These tales of suppressed inventions
are a collective loss for our society, which is deprived
of potentially transformative technologies and solutions. Yet, within these
stories of suppression, there lies a resilient thread of hope. We must continue questioning
and seeking out hidden truths, while also advocating
for a world where innovation is not denied
due to economics and politics but embraced for its potential
to improve the human condition. Thank you for watching. If you want to learn about
more inventions like these, you can watch

It's a stark change from 2015 when he told Vanity Fair that Trump winning the  nomination be good. While Vice President Kamala Harris has broad support in Silicon Valley. Musk is part of a small group of tech leaders and investors that have become more  supportive of Trump over the last eight years as they see it. Trump's Republican Party is more welcoming of bold ideas and what we call  kind of American dynamism. I think if these big names are coming out in support of Donald Trump but also  opening their pocketbooks that could have lasting effects on any election. Here's the philosophy, policies and relationships behind the shift and what it means for Silicon  Valley and the election to understand the move to the  right. You have to start here with some tech leaders that were part of a group known as the paypal  mafia. It's a collection of former employees and founders of paypal, many of which have gone on to build some of tech's most influential companies. They're very well connected in the Valley. These are people that are considered thought leaders in the tech space. This group varies on politics. Several lean democratic like Reid Hoffman, one of Harris's biggest supporters this year, she, you know, growing up through California saw all the positives about entrepreneurship and technology. But Peter Thiel has long been an unorthodox voice in Silicon Valley. He has called himself a conservative libertarian and was close with controversial blogger, Curtiss Yarin who refers to himself as a neo monarchist. You'll notice that everything you have that works was made in a  monarchy or by a monarchy or both. So for example, this iphone, this iphone was produced by Apple, which is a monarchy that is, it's a corporation core to both Yarin and Thiel's politics is a conviction that  political and economic systems are bloated, inefficient and in need of radical reform. I still think there is a lot that uh one could do by deregulating  having, you know, less severely regulated economy. The paypal mafia circle of influence steadily expanded, connecting them with other leaders in the sector. One of those connections was Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist who worked on Hyperloop with Musk. I think this is a tech centered centrist movement and we're  techno optimists during the Obama administration, Silicon Valley flourished thanks in part to government support. Every time I come to Silicon Valley, every time I come to this region, I am excited about America's future. People like President Obama really held up big tech as these of innovation, of job creation, as these homegrown places that we should really celebrate. Pishevar participated in tech roundtables and served on the Fulbright Board in the  Obama administration when I was working on Hyperloop, the first one of the first people I pitched it to was President Obama areas of support that President  Obama gave towards innovation. It was great. But the ground started to shift in 2016. Though many Silicon Valley leaders backed Hillary Clinton Thiel to depart from his  colleagues as one of few to publicly endorse Trump. I'm not a politician, but neither is Donald Trump. So when Peter T came out in support of Donald Trump, which was not really a popular thing to do. It kind of gave legitimacy to supporting Trump in the 2020 election, the communications and electronic sector, which includes many but not all tech companies donated a record amount of  money to democratic candidates and pacs. But at the same time, Trump garnered more support from Silicon Valley leaders than he did in 2016, including his future vice presidential candidate, JD Vance Vance previously worked with Thiel. I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left, right. We need like a de baathification program, but like a de woke education program in the United States. And tension was growing between Musk and Democrats, the more progressive wing of the party, people like Elizabeth Warren sort of made him the face of corporate greed. The world's richest freeloader evidently has a very thin  skin. Another pain point for Musk was a series of events and held by the White House. The Biden administration has been very pro union and Musk is famously  anti union. So when the White House would have these big EV summits or Joe Biden would  talk about the EV revolution. Elon was never mentioned. Didn't mention Tesla once and praised J Ford for leading the EV revolution. Does this sound maybe a little biased? Biden's administration also cracked down on big tech and worked on regulations  around crypto and A I. There was a very anti crypto stance and that had a very  negative impact on the industry. A lot of companies got fined and hurt some of them feel like they can't get  mergers done or that, that these policies are overreaching and hurting innovation. Other Biden administration policies, Peso said drove him to support Trump included the handling of Iran fiscal  policy and what he sees as different attitudes about free speech. The Democrats are talking about filtering people's ability to express themselves  on the internet and that's the opposite. The antithesis of what people on the more centrist  conservative side believe in. Musk has expressed similar concerns. Free speech is important for a healthy democracy. It is important. Still in 2022 Musk expressed doubts about Trump in July  of that year, the Tesla CEO wrote on X, I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into sunset. But behind the scenes, Musk was already donating to Republican causes and candidates. We found that Musk has been setting up dark money vehicles to funnel his  funds. One of them was Stephen Miller's organization and an ad campaign called Citizens for  Sanity. These ads were considered controversial. They attacked democratic candidates for being woke for transgender  policies for illegal immigration and for a while who was  behind these ads was a giant mystery, but we found out that he was behind that. In 2023 Musk was secretly behind Governor Ron desantis run  for presidential election, which makes this election cycle all the more fascinating because he's not only in support of  Donald Trump this election cycle who was not his first pick for president, but he created Super PAC in order to help his re election chances. As of October 28 Musk had donated over 118 million to his  America PAC. Donations to Trump have flowed in from multiple corners in June Peso  hosted a fundraiser with David Sachs. The event raised $12 million. I think everyone came away with the impression that he is a true patriot who  loves America and loves Americans and believes in American  exceptionalism in October. America. PAC began offering $47 to those who referred registered voters to sign a  petition supporting the 1st and 2nd amendments. And Musk started speaking about a potential role in the Trump administration  assuming President Trump is willing. And I think he is, I intend to play a significant role in, you know, in making government efficient watching Ilan become more politically engaged  has been, you know, I think exhilarating for many of us because he is the  greatest engineer ever. And he's one of the greatest entrepreneurs in human history. Democrats are still overwhelmingly winning support from the communications and  electronics sector. Tech leaders like Mark Cuban are also hitting the road on Harris's pay. Speaking against Trump and now his trade policies are  basically just gibberish. Harris has also brought back some of the support that the party lost under Biden venture  capitalist Ben Horowitz, for example, posted on X that he would be donating to both campaigns after previously saying  he would donate to Trump. But still the shift among these prominent leaders could change the dynamics of  the election. America PAC has become involved in Trump's campaigning. They're door knocking, they are registering voters, they're getting people absentee ballots. That's a very meaningful part of the ground game for the Trump campaign and especially  in an election that is so close and in swing states that are so important. Thiel Vance Trump and Sachs did not respond to requests for comment on this  video."

well good evening everybody Welcome Elon thanks for being here thank you for having me we feel we feel very privileged we're excited to have you right so I'm going to start with some questions and then we're going to open it up let me get straight into it so Bill Gat said there is no one in our time who has done more to push the bounds of science Innovation than you well it's kind of to say well that's it that's a nice thing to have anyone say about you nice coming from Bill Gates but oddly enough when it comes to AI actually for around a decade you've almost been doing the opposite and saying hang on we need to think about what we're doing and what we're pushing here and what do we do to make this safe and and actually maybe we shouldn't be pushing as fast or as hard as we are like I mean you've been doing it for a decade like what was it that caused you to think about it that way and you know why do we need to be worried yeah I've been somewhat of a Cassandra for quite a while um where where people would I tell you like we should really be concerned about AI they be like what are you talking about like they've never really had any experience with with AI but since I was immersed in um technology I have been immersed in technology for a long time I could see it coming um so uh but I think this year was there've been a number of of breakthroughs I mean you know the point in which someone can see a dynamically created video of themselves um you know like somebody could make a video of you saying anything in real time um or me um and uh so the sort of the deep Pake videos which are really incredibly good in fact sometimes more convincing than real ones um and deep real um and um and then and then obviously things like CH GPT were were quite remarkable now I saw gpt1 gpt2 gpt3 gp4 that you know the whole sort of lead up to that so it was easy for me to um kind of see where it's going if you just sort of extrapolate the points on a curve and assume that Trend will continue then we will have um profound artificial intelligence and obviously at a level that far exceeds human intelligence um so um but I'm I'm glad to see at this point that uh people are taking uh safety seriously and i' I'd uh like to say thank you for holding this AI safety conference I think actually it will regard on in history as being very important I think it's it's really quite profound um and um and and I do think overall that the potential is there for a artificial intelligence AI to um have most likely a positive effect um and to create a future of abundance where there is no scarcity of goods and services um but but it is somewhat the of the the magic Genie problem where if you have a magic Genie that can grant all the wishes um usually those stories um don't end well be careful what you wish for including wishes yeah yeah so you you you talked a little bit about about the the summit and thank you for being engaged in it which has been great and people enjoyed having you there participating in this dialogue now one of the things that we achieved today in the meetings between the companies and the leaders was an agreement that externally ideally governments should be doing safety testing of models before they're released I think this is something that you've spoken about a little bit it was something we worked really hard on because you know my job in government is to say hang on there is a potential risk here not a not a definite risk but a potential risk of something that could be bad you know my job is to protect the country yes that's and we can only do that if we develop the capability we need in our safety Institute and then go in and make sure we can test the models before they are release delighted that that happened today but you know what what's your view on what we should be doing right you've talked about the potential risk right again we don't know but you know what are the types of things governments like our should be doing to manage and mitigate against those risks well I generally think that that it is good for government to play a role when the public safety is is at risk so um you know really for the vast majority of software um the public safety is not at risk I mean if if the if the uh app crashes on your phone or your laptop it's not a a massive catastrophe um but when you're talking about digital superintelligence I think which does pose a risk to the public then there is a role for government to play to safeguard the interest of the public and and this is of course true in many fields um you know Aviation cars you know I and I deal with Regulators throughout the world uh because of um stalling being Communications Rockets being Aerospace and cars you know being TR vehicle transport so I'm very familiar with dealing with with Regulators um and I actually agree with the vast majority of regulations there's a few that I disagree with from time to time but Point one% probably of or less than 1% of regulations I disagree with so um and there is some concern from uh people in silic Valley who who' have never dealt with Regulators before and they think that this is going to just Crush Innovation and and slow them down and be annoying but and and uh it will be annoying it's true um they're not wrong about that um but but but I think there's we've learned over the years that uh having a referee is a good thing and if you look at any sports game there's always a a referee and and nobody's suggesting I think to have a sports game without one um and and I think that's the the right way to think about this is for um for government to be a a referee to make sure the Sportsman like conduct and and and that the public safety is um you know is addressed that we care about the public safety because I think there might be at times too much optimism about technology and I speak I say that as a technologist I mean so I ought to know um and and uh and and like I said on on balance I think that the AI will be a forceable good most likely but the probability of it going bad is not 0% yeah so we we just need to mitigate the downside potential and then how you talked about referee and that's what we're trying right there yeah well there we go I mean you know and we talked about this and Demus and I discussed this a long time ago like literally facing right at and actually you know Demus to his credit and the credit of people in industry did say that to us I you know de was say it's not right that Demus and his colleagues are marking their own homework right there needs to be someone independent and that's why we've developed the safety Institute here I mean do you think governments can develop the expertise one of the things we need to do is say hang on you know Demis Sam all the others have got a lot of very smart people doing this governments need to quickly tool up capability wise Personnel wise which is what we're doing I mean do you think it is possible for governments to do that fast enough given how quickly the technology is developing or what do we need to do to make sure we do do it quick enough no I think it's it's a good it's a great Point you're making um the the pace of of AI is faster than any technology I've seen in history by far um and it's it seems to be growing in capability by at at least fivefold perhaps 10 fold per year it it'll certainly grow by an order of magnitude next year yeah so um so and and government isn't used to moving at that speed um but I but I think even if there are not um firm regulations um even if there's not even if there isn't an enforcement capability Simply Having insight and being able to highlight concerns to the public will be very powerful um so even if that's all that's accomplished I think that will be very very good okay yeah well hopefully we can do better than that hopefully yeah no but that that's helpful actually we were talking before it was striking you you someone who spent their life in technology living More's law and what was interesting over the last couple of days talking to everyone who's doing the development of this and I think youd concur with this is is just the pace of advancement here is unlike anything all of you have seen in your careers and technology is that fair because you've got these kind of compounding effects from the hardware and and the data and the Personnel yeah um I mean the two um currently the two leading centers for AI development are C Isco Bay Area and the and the sort of London area that um and there are many other places where it's being done but those are the two leading areas so I think if um you know if if the United States and the UK um and and China are um sort of aligned on on safety that's all going to be a good thing because that's really that's where that's that's where the the leadership is generally I me you actually you mentioned China that so I I took a decision to invite China to to Summit over the last couple days and it was not an easy decision a lot of people criticize me for it you know my view is if you're going to tryal serious conversation you need to but I what would your thoughts you do business all around the world you just talked about it there yeah you know should we be engaging with them can we trust them is that the right thing to have done if if we don't if China is not on board with uh AI safety it it's somewhat of a mood situation U the single biggest objection that I get to any kind of AI regulation or or sort of safety controls um are well China's not going to do it and therefore they will just jump into the lead and exceed us whole um but but actually China is willing to participate in uh in AI safety um and thank you for inviting them and I and they you know I I think we should thank China for for attending um when I was when I was in China earlier this year the my main subject of discussion with this the leadership in China was AI safety and saying that this this is really something that they they should care about and um they took seriously and and and um and you are too which is which is great um and having them here I think was essential really if they if they're if they're not participants it's it's uh pointless it's pointless yeah no that and I think we were pleased I they were engaged yesterday in the discussions and actually ended up signing the same communic that everyone else did that's great which is a good stop right and I said if we need everyone to approach us in a similar way if we're going to have I think a realistic chance of of resolving it I was going to you talked about Innovation earlier and and regul being annoying there was a good debate today we had about open source and I think you you've kind of been a proponent of algorithmic transparency and making some of the the X algorithms public and you actually we were talking about Jeffrey Hinton on the way in yeah you know he he's particularly been very concerned about open- Source models being used by Bad actors you've got a group of people who say they are critical to Innovation happening in that distributed way look it's it's a trick there's probably no perfect answer and there's a tricky balance what are your thoughts on how we should approach this open- Source question or you know where should we be targeting whatever regulatory or monitoring that we're going to do well the open source um algorithms and data tend to lag the close Source by 6 to 12 months um but so so there but given the rate of improvement that there's actually therefore quite a big difference between the the closed source and the and the open um if things are improving by factor of let's say five or more um than being a year behind is you're five times worse so it's a pretty big difference and that might be actually an okay situation um but it it certainly will'll get to the point where you've got open source um AI that can do that that will start to approach human level intelligence will perhap succeed it um I don't know quite what to do about it I think it's somewhat inev inevitable there will be some amount of Open Source and I I I guess I would have a slight bias towards open source uh because at least you can see what's going on whereas closed Source you don't know what's going on now it should be said with AI that even if it's open source do you actually know what's going on because if you've got a gigantic data file and um you know sort of billions of of of data points weights and parameters uh you can't just read it and see what it's going to do it's a gigantic file of inscrutable numbers um you can test it when you when you run it you can test it you can run a bunch of tests to see what it's going to do but it it's probabilistic as opposed to um deterministic it's not it's not like traditional programming where you've got a you've got very discret logic and and and the outcome is very predictable and you can read each line and see what each Line's going to do um uh a neural net is just a whole bunch of probabilities um I mean it sort of ends up being a giant comma separated value file it's like our digital guide is a CSP file really okay um but that that is kind of what it is yeah now that that point you've just made is one that we have been talking about a lot because again conversation with the people who developing their technology make the point that you've just made it it is not like normal software where there's predictability about inputs improving leading to this particular output improving and as the models iterate and prove we don't quite know what's going to come out the other end I think Demis would agree with that which is why I think there is this uh bias for look we need to get in there while the training runs are being done before the models are released to understand what is this new iteration brought about in terms of capability which it it sounds like you would U would agree with I I was going to shift gears a little bit on you know you've talked a lot about human consciousness human agency which actually might strike people as as strange given that you are known for being such a brilliant innovator in technology ologist but it's it's quite heartfelt when I hear you talk about it and the importance of maintaining that agency in technology and preserving human consciousness now it kind of links to the thing I was going to ask is when I do interviews or talk to people out and about in this job about AI the thing that comes up most actually is is probably not so much of the stuff we've been talking about but jobs it's what does AI mean for my job is it going to mean that I don't have a job or my kids are not going to have a job now you know my my answer as a you as a policy maker as a leader is you know actually AI is already creating jobs and you can see that in the companies that are starting also the way it's being used is a little bit more as a co-pilot necessarily versus replacing the person there's still human agency but it's helping you do your job better which is a good thing and and as we've seen with technological Revolutions in the past clearly there's change in the labor market the amount of jobs I was quoting an MIT study today that they did a couple of years ago something like 60% of the jobs at that moment didn't exist 40 years ago so hard to predict and my job is to create an incredible education system whether it's at school whether it's retraining people at any point in their career because ultimately if we've got a skilled population they'll be able to keep up with the the pace of change and have a good life but you know that it's still a concern and you know you what would your kind of observation be on on AI and the impact on labor markets and people's jobs and how they should feel about that as they they think about this well I think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history here um you know where we have for the first time we will have the first time something that is smarter than the smartest human um and that I mean it's hard to say exactly what that moment is but but there will come a point where no job is needed you can have a job if you want to have a job for sort of personal satisfaction but the AI will be able to do everything so I don't know if that makes people comfortable uncomfortable it's [Laughter] it's you know that's why that's why I say if if you if you wish for a magic Genie that gives you any wishes you want and there's no limit you don't have those three limit three wish limit nonsense you just have as many as many wishes as you want um so uh it's both good and bad um one of the challenges in the future will be how do we find meaning in life if if you have a gen that can do everything you want I I I do think we we it's it's it's hard you know when when when this new technology it tends to have usually follow an S curve in this case we're going to be on the exponential portion of the S curve for a long time um and you like you'll be able to ask for anything it won't be we won't have Universal basic income we'll have Universal High income so in some in some sense it'll be somewhat of a leveler um or an equalizer you know because really I think everyone will have access to this magic Genie um and you able to ask any question it'll be certainly be good for Education you it'll be the best tutor you could I'm the most patient tutor uh sit there all day um and uh there will be no shortage of goods and services will be an age of abundance um I think if I'd recommend people read uh in Banks the banks culture books are probably the best envisioning if fact not probably they're definitely by far the best envisioning of an AI future um there's nothing even close so I'd recommend really recommend fanks I'm very big fan um all his books are good um does not say which one all of them um so so that's that that'll give you a sense of what is a I guess a fairly utopian or protop um future with with AI yeah um which is good from a as you said it's a universal High income which is a nice phrase and that's it's good from a kind of materialistic sense a of abundance actually that it kind of then leads to the question that you pose right I'm someone who believes you know work gives you meaning right I think a lot about that as as you know I think work is a good thing it you know gives people purpose in their lives and if you then remove a large chunk of that you know what does that mean and where do you get that you know where do you get that drive that motivation that purpose I mean you were talking about it you you work a lot of hours I do no as I was mentioning when we we were talking earlier I have to somewhat engage in deliberate suspension of disbelief um because I'm I'm putting so much Blood Sweat and Tears into a work project and burning the you know 3:00 a.m. oil um then um I'm like wait why am I doing this I can just wait for the AI to do it I'm just lashing myself for no reason yeah um must be a glut for punishment or something um so we called call Demus and tell him to hurry up up and then you can have a holiday right that's the plan yeah no it's a it's a tricky it's a tricky thing because I think you know part of our job is to make sure that we can navigate to that very I think largely positive place that you're describing and help people through it between now and then because these things bring a lot of about a change in in the labor market as we've seen yeah um I I think it probably is generally a good thing because you know there are a lot of jobs that are uncomfortable or dangerous or sort of tedious um and the computer will have no problem doing that be happy to do that all day long so um you know it's fun to cook food but it's not that fun to wash dishes like but the computer's perfectly happy to wash dishes um I I guess there is um you know we still have uh sports like where where where humans compete and like the Olympics and obviously um a machine can can go faster than any human but we still have uh we still humans race against each other um and uh and have all you know have these Sports competitions against each other where even though the machines are better they're still I guess competing to see who can be the best human at something yeah um and and people do find fulfillment in that so I guess that's perhaps a a good example of how even when machines are faster than are stronger than us we still find a way we still we still enjoy competing against other humans to at least to who the best human yeah that's that's a good that's a good analogy and we've been talking a lot about managing the risks I just before we move on and finish on AI is just talk a little bit about the opportunities you know you you're engaging lots of different companies neur being an obvious one which is doing which is doing some exciting stuff I you touched on the thing that I'm probably most excited about which is in education yeah and I think many people will have seen s Khan's video from earlier this year is Ted talk about as you talked about it's like personal tutor yeah personal tutor an amazing personal tutor an amazing personal tutor and we know the difference in learning having that personalized tutor is incredible compared to class from learning if you can have every child have a personal tutor specifically for them that then just evolves with them over time that could be extraordinary so that you know for me I look at that I think gosh that is within reach at this point and and that's one of the benefits I'm most excited about like when you look at the the landscape of things that you see as possible what is it that you know you are particularly excited about I I think certainly ai ai tter are going to be amazing um perhaps already are uh I think there's also perhaps companionship which may seem odd because how can the computer really be your friend but if you if you have an AI that has memory you know and remembers all of your interactions and has read every you can say like give it permission to read everything you've ever done so it really will know you better than anyone perhaps even yourself um and and and where you can talk to it every day and and those conversations spold upon each other you will actually have a great friend um as long as that friend can stay your friend and not get turned off or something don't turn off my friends um but I think that will actually be a real thing um and um I have a one of my sons is is sort of has some learning disabilities has trouble making friends actually and and I was like well you know he an AI friend would actually be great for him oh okay you know it's that was a surprising answer that's actually it's worth uh worth reflecting on it's really interesting Ian we're already seeing it actually as we deliver you know Psychotherapy anyway now doing far more by digitally and by telephone to people and it's making a huge difference and you can see a world and which actually you know AI can provide that social benefit to people um just quick question on on X and then we should open it up to everybody you made a change when you in one of the well made many changes but quite a few one one of the one of the Chang you love that letter yeah i' got a real thing about it you you really do you really do one of the changes which you know kind of you know goes into the space that you know we have to operate in and this this balance between free speech and moderation it's you know we grapple with as politicians you were grappling with your own version of that and and you you moved away from a kind of manual human yeah uh way of doing it the moderation to the the community notes and and I think that's it it was an interesting change right it's not what everyone else has done it would be good you know what's what was the reasoning behind that and why you think that is a better way to do that um yeah part of the problem is if if you if you Empower people as censors then well have there's going to be some amount of bias they have um and then whoever appoints the sensors is effectively in control of information so then the the idea behind Community notes is well how do we have a consensus driven uh I mean so it's not really censoring it but consensus driven approach to truth how do we or how do we how do we make things um the least amount untrue like you can say like what one can't pass perhaps get to Pure truth but you can aspire to be more truthful um so the the the thing about Community notes is it doesn't actually delete anything it simply adds context now that context could be this thing is untrue for the following reasons um um and but but importantly with Community notes um everything is open source actually so you can see ex the software um every line of the software you can see all of the data that went into a community node and you and you can independently create that Community node so if you've got if you see manipulation of the data you can actually highlight that and say well this this this there appears to be some gaming of the system um and you can suggest improvements um so it's it's it's maximum transparency which is I think combined with the kind of wisdom of the crowds and transparency to get to a better Onis and and really one of the key elements of community notes is that in order for to be shown people who have historically disagreed must agree um and and there is a bit of AI usage here so there's we populate a parameter space um around each contributor to community notes and then a parameter space so so everyone's got basically these these vectors associated with them which so it's it's not as simple as as right or left it's saying it's it's more it's several hundred vectors that that because things are more complicated than something right right or left and um and and then we'll we'll do sort of a uh inverse correlation say like okay these these people generally disagree but they agree about this note okay so then that so then that that that gives the note credibility okay um yeah that's the that's the core of it and it's working quite well yeah um I've yet to see a note actually be be present for more than a few hours uh that that is incorrect so the batting average is extremely good and when I ask you people say oh they're worried about Community notes sort of being disinformation like send me one and then they can't so so I think it's I think it's quite good I mean the general aspiration is with the xplatform is to inform and entertain the public um and to be as accurate as possible and as truthful as possible um even if someone doesn't like the truth you know people don't always like the truth um no not always um but but that's that's the aspiration and I think if if we are if we stay true to the truth then I think we'll find that people uh use use the system to learn what is going on and to to learn it I I think actually truth pays um so I think it'll be what what I mean assuming you don't want to engage in self- delusion then um then I think it's it's the smart move you know so excellent very helpful right let's uh open it up to all our guests here we've got some microphones they'll come put your hands up they'll come come and find you we got yes go for it thank you good evening uh Alice bentin from entrepreneur first uh thank you for a fascinating conversation I suppose a question for each of you um prime minister the UK has some of the best universities in the world we have the talent what will it take for the UK to be a real breeding breeding ground for unicorn companies um and Elon uh being a Founder in the UK is still a non-obvious career choice for the most exceptional technical Talent what are the cultural elements that we need to put into place to change this thank you both John you want to go first go for it um sure well you're right that there are um cultural elements where you you you know the the culture should celebrate creating new companies um and um and there should be a bias towards supporting um small small companies because they're the ones that need nurturing the larger companies really don't need nurturing ing um so you know just you can think of it's sort of like a garden if it's a little Sprout it needs needs nurturing if it's a Mighty Oak it doesn't need quite as much um so I think uh that that that is a mindset change that is important um but but I I should mention that um uh London is uh you know London and San Francisco or the Bay Area are really the two senses for AI so that so London is actually doing doing very well on that front that the two MO I say the two leading locations on Earth and you know San Francisco's probably ahead of London but London's really very strong or London area um greater London home counties I guess keep going keep going um so I'm just saying objectively this is the case um um and but you do need that uh you need you need the infrastructure you need you need um landlords who are willing to uh rent to new companies you you need uh law firms and accountants that are willing to support new companies and it's generally a mind it is a mindset change um and I think some of that is happening but I think really it's just culturally people need to decide this is this is a good thing yeah yeah no actually well thanks for for what you said about the UK it's something that we work hard on lots of people in the room are are part of what makes this a fabulous place for intive companies including uh Alice so Alice what I'd say is you know my job is to get all the you know the nuts and bolts right make sure that all of you are starting companies can raise the capital that you need everything from you know your seed funding with our incredible you know Eis tax reliefs all the way through to you know your late stage rounds and we need reform of our Pension funds and the Chancellor's got a bunch of incredible reforms to unlock capital from all the people who have it and deploy it into growth Equity right that is a work in progress we're not there yet but I think we're we're making we're making good progress we need talent we need people you right so that means an education system that prioritizes the things that matter and you've seen my reforms I go on about more maths more maths more maths um but I think that is important but also attracting the best and the brightest here if you look at our fastest growing companies in in this country and I think it's probably the same in in the US over half of them have a non-british Founder right and so that tells you we've got to be a place that is open to the world's best and brightest entrepreneurial Talent so the Visa regime that we've put in place I think does that makes it easy for those people to come here and then actually it's the thing that we spent the beginning of the session talking about the regulation right making sure that we've got a regulatory system that's Pro Innovation that yeah we of course we always need guard rails on the things uh that will worry us but we've got to create a space for people to innovate and do different things you know those are all my jobs the thing that is tougher is the thing that Elon talked about which is culture right it's how do you transpose that culture from places like Silicon Valley across the world where people are unafraid to give up the security of a regular paycheck to go and start something and be comfortable with failure you you talked about that a lot I think you talked about it more in when you were playing games right but that you've got to be comfortable failing and knowing that that's just part of the process and that is a it's a tricky cultural thing to do overnight but it's an important part of I think creating that kind of environment yeah if if you don't succeed with your first startup it shouldn't be sort of a catastrophic career ending exactly thing it should be you know what good I think should like should be like well you know you gave it a good shot you know and and and now try again exactly and it's so one thing I was going to mention is like obviously creating a company is sort of a highrisk high reward uh situation um but and I don't know quite what the how it works in in the UK I think it's probably better than than um Continental Europe um but the the stock options are very difficult in most parts of Europe I'm not sure if how than the UK but but if somebody's basically going to risk their the sort of life savings and with and the vast majority of startups fail so I mean you hear about the startups that succeed but most companies are most startups consist of you know a massive amount of of of work um followed by failure that's actually most most companies and so it's a highrisk high reward and and and so the higher reward part does need to be there for it to make sense yeah I think that was a very soft pitch for tax policy that I CH but I actually I can tell you so look I a I agree and we have so we have I think relative to certainly European countries but certainly the US definitely California a much lower rate of capital gains tax okay right so for those people who are risking and growing something like we think the reward should be there at the end so 20% capital gains tax rate um and on stock options I don't know if we've got anyone from index ventures in in the room so you know index one of our bleeding VC funds here they they do a regular report looking at most countries tax treatment of stock options yeah and you know when I was Chancellor of you know treasury secretary equivalent you know we were I think down at uh we were pretty good but we were fourth or fifth and I said we need to for exactly the reason that you mentioned was like this has got to be the best place for innovators we need to move that up and I think in the last iteration of that report we had because of the changes that um Jeremy and I had made we have moved up to I think second from from memory so hopefully that should give you and everyone else some comfort that we recognize that's important because when people work hard and risk things yeah they should be able to enjoy the rewards of that high risk High reward yeah and I think we have a we very much have a tax system that supports that and those are the values that you know I believe in and I think most of us in this room probably do as well right next uh next question I've got seven front of me and then I'll come over here go on go on S thanks very much um we've talked about some really big Ideas um Global changing ideas I'm really interested particularly in the context of creation of of science and technology superhubs and so on how does that map onto the everyday lives of uh of people living in say Austin Texas to choose r or in my case Nottingham East Midlands uh what what is how do you see that evolving for people you know every day the sort of everyday effects of AI yeah um for context Elon so Seb Seb runs are are equivalent of CVS right or Walgreens so you know when as I visited right so he's got of people coming in his shops every day and it's making sure how do we make this relevant I think so is your question how how is this relevant to that person you know maybe actually let me go I'll go first on that because I I think it's a a fair a fair point I was just going over with the team a couple of things that we're doing because I was thinking like how are we doing AI right now that it's making a difference to people's lives and we have this thing called gov.uk which is which actually when we when it happened several years ago was a pioneering thing all the government information brought together on one website gov.uk and so you need to get a driving license passport any interaction with government it was centralized in a very easy relatively easy to use way uh better than most better than most yeah so we we are about so we're about to deploy AI across that platform so that is something that I think you know several million people a day use right so a large chunk of the population is interacting with gov.uk every single day to do all these day-to-day tasks right every one of your customers is doing all those things and so we're about to deploy AI into that to make that whole process so much easier because you know some people will be like look well I'm currently here and I've lost my passport and my flight's in five hours you know at the moment that would require you know how many steps to figure out what you do you know we actually when we deploy the AI it should be that you could just literally say that and boom boom boom boom boom this is what we're going to do walk you through it and that's going to benefit millions and millions of people every single day right cuz that's a very practical way in my seat that I can start using this technology to help people in their day-to-day lives not just Healthcare discoveries and everything else that we're also doing but I thought that's quite a powerful demonstration of literally your day-to-day customer seeing actually their just day-to-day life get a little bit easier because of something that you know Elon deis and others in this room have helped create yeah no exactly the the the most immediate thing is just being able to ask um like having a very smart friend that you can ask anything um you know ask how to make something how to solve any problem and it'll tell you um so and and obviously companies are going to adopt this so I think you'll have much better customer service I guess essentially that'll probably be the first thing you notice um and um and then we talked about education yeah um so having a tutor so if you're trying to understand a subject like having a phenomenal tutor on any subject is that that's really pretty much there already almost I mean we need to obviously AI needs to stop hallucinating before you know it can't give you I mean we we still have a little bit of the problem where it can give you an answer that's confidently wrong um with great grammar uh and you know bullet points and everything in citations that was not real so it has to be okay we need to make sure it's it's not it's not it's not giving you confidently wrong two dire answers um but but we that's going to happen quick pretty quickly where it is actually correct um so yeah I going to say for any for any parent who was homeschooling during coid and realizing what their kids needed to be helped with that will come as an enormous relief I think very very good right have we got let's go questions uh over here who have we got we any microphones or Brent are you there perfect hi Bren hobman um so you know you've spoken eloquently about abundance and the age of abundance so it it feels obviously with AI it's everything everywhere everywhere all at once but with um with robots and to to get the age of abundance we'll need a lot of robots I know you're working hard on robots as well are there sort of constraints that we should think of and our politicians should be thinking of that we might get one country might get heavily behind in in Rob in robots that can do all these things and enter the age of abundance and therefore be at a strategic disadvantage well really anything that can be actuated by a computer is effectively a robot um so you can think of frankly Tesla cause are robots on Wheels um anything that's connected to the internet is effectively an endpoint actuator for artificial intelligence um so um you've got Boston Dynamics obviously they've been making impressive robots for a while um I think they're at this point mostly owned by Hyundai so I I guess when I's probably going to make um robots of that are humanoid and and and some rather interesting shapes that I wasn't disting like the one that looks like a has wheels and looks sort of like a kangaroo on Wheels I'm not sure what that is but um um looks a little dented frankly but um but there's going to be all sorts of all sorts of robots um you've got the company Dyson in in the UK which I think does some pretty impressive things um I I I think the UK will not be behind actually on on that front um UK also has arm which is um really the the best one one of the best perhaps the best uh in in uh chip design in the world um Tesla uses a lot of a lot of arm technology almost everyone does actually so I think the UK is in in a strong position um Germany obviously makes a lot of robots industrial robots uh that I mean I think generally countries that make um robots of any kind even if they seem somewhat conventional will be will be fine um I do think there is a there is a a safety concern especially with humanoid robots because um you at least the car can't chase you into this building not very easily you know or chase you off a tree or you know um you can sort of run up a flight of stairs and get away from a Tesla um um I think there a Stephen King movie about that um if your car gets possessed um so but if you have a humanoid robot it can it can basically chase you anywhere so I I think we should have some kind of um hardwired local cut off um that that you can't update from the internet so anything that can be software updated from the internet obviously can be overridden um but if you have a local sort of off switch um where you p pa SA a keyword or something and then that puts the robot into a safe State um some kind of localized safe State ability um an off switch you know where you don't have to get too close to the robot I don't know so if you've got millions of these things going all over the place you're not selling it just you know like no I I know um I'm saying it's is something we should be quite concerned about um because if robot can robot can follow you anywhere then you know what if they just one day get a software update and they're not so friendly anymore um then we've got a James Cameron movie on I um it's it's actually that's it's funny you're saying that because we in our session that we had today I you know just would say who we they made exactly the same point right de so we're talking about they're talking about movies actually without mentioning James Cameron they're talking about James camera movies and they're saying if you think about it's not just those movies but any of these movies trains Subways metros cars buses they said all these movies with the same plot fundamentally all end with the person turning it off right or finding a way to shut the thing down and they were making the same point that that you were about the importance of actual physical off switches yeah and so all the technology is great but fundamentally this same movie has played out 50 times we've all watched it and all fundamentally you know you know point I'm referring to right it all ends in pretty much the same way with someone finding a way to just yeah do thing um which is kind of interesting that you said a similar point right it's probably not the it's not the obvious place you'd go to but maybe that could be one of the tests for the AI we we just say like blank is your favorite jamers Cameron movie fill in the blank yeah excellent right um yes we got over there yeah perfect hi a question for you both um so I'm a founder of a Ai and ml scaleup in the third Center for AI which is leads in the north of England I'm bit biased um since the launch of chat GPT three months after that we saw a real increase in fishing attacks using much more sophisticated language patterns um what do we do to protect businesses consumers so they trust this technology better and how do we bring them along that Journey with us well I think we shouldn't trust it that much actually um it is actually quite quite a significant challenge because we're getting to the point where even open source AI can pass uh human capture tests so you know this s are you a human identify all the traffic lights in this picture you're like okay yeah is going to have a no problem doing that in fact it'll do it better than a human and faster than a human so we're like how do you you know at the point of which is better a better human better passing human test than humans then well what tests actually make sense that is a real problem I don't actually have a good solution to it um that one of the things we're trying to figure out on the xplatform is how to deal with that because it really we really are at the point where um even with with uh open source you know readily available AI you don't need to be sort of leading the field um you can actually be better than humans at passing these tests um and that's sort of why we're thinking well perhaps we should sort of charge a a dollar or a pound a year it's a very tiny amount of money but it's it still it still makes it prohibitively expensive to make a million Parts um so um and especially if you need a million payment methods then you you run out of sort of for stolen credit cards pretty quickly um uh so that that's that's sort of where we're thinking like we might have to sort of just charge some very tiny amount of money um3 cents a day effectively to um deal with the the onslaught of AI powered bonds um and if if and that that is that is still a growing problem but will will be I think perhaps an insurmountable problem next year so and and and then you have to worry about well manipulation of of um information is making something seem very popular when in fact it is not because it's getting boosted by all these likes and and and repost from um AI powered bots so that's why I sort of think somewhat inevitably it leads to some small payment in order to uh dramatically increase the the cost of a bond um so I think I think frankly I think probably any social media system that doesn't do that will simply be overrun by B you know I think my my general answer would be you know we we need to show that we are on top of mitigating the risk right so people can trust the technology that's what actually the last couple of days has been about on the safety Summit is just showing you know we're investing in the safety Institute having the people who can do the research on these things to figure out how we mitigate against them and we have to do it fast and we have to keep iterating it because I think all of us probably in this room believe that the technology can be incredibly powerful but we've got to make sure we bring people along that Journey with us that we're handling the risks that are there and I said there's a job to do and the last couple of days I think we make good progress on it because we want to focus on the positives and manage these things but that requires action and and that's what the last couple of days has been about and your your um story your analogy there was part of the research that actually you know the team working on the task force here published and presented yesterday I don't know if you saw it was uh which is a essentially that it was a using AI to do to create a ton of fake profiles on social media and then infiltrate particular groups with particular information and actually at the moment that is said to your point of it's like cost free it's it's it's getting it's getting to the point where it's like really you're going to have 100 for a penny sort of thing ridiculous and if you think about some of these social networks at quite a neighborhood or town level it's not that many fake profiles that you need to quickly create suddenly they're everywhere and there's some local issue that might be of importance and you know the team have have run versions of how that would look like and suddenly they're interacting with everybody and then spreading a misinformation around ex your point that's we literally as part of the research that we published on misinformation yesterday it's uh it's a real challenge yeah exactly to your point I mean you the images it's it's you don't even need to steal some body's picture cuz that's traceable but you can actually just say create a new a new image of a person realistic looking but doesn't exist um and and then create a biography realistic but doesn't exist and do that on mass and practically the only way we be able to tell us that the gram is too good did give away yeah no tyos come on now I'm getting wave that because I think we are out of time I don't we take one very brief last question and let's make a go one yes sir going your right in front of me go thank you for the opportunity Elon question for you um related to X platform are there simple things we can do especially when it comes to visual media you alluded to the fact that it's fairly straightforward and effectively free to make people like yourself say and do things that you never said or did yeah um can we do something like cryptographically signed media I'm from Adobe we're working on this project yeah Twitter was a member love to see X come back okay um digitally signed media to indicate uh not only what was created by AI but what came from a camera what was real yeah to imbue a sense of Trust in Media that can go viral that sounds like a good idea actually so if um some some way of authenticating would be would be good um so yeah I I that sounds like a good idea we we should probably do it there you go actually on that on that point so I've I've already so this is particularly pertinent for people in my job right and I've already had a situation happen to me with a doctored image that goes everywhere negative by the time everyone realizes well that's fake and we should stop sending it the damage is damage is done um and actually we were again reflecting today if you think next year you've got elections in you know I think you know the US India I think Indonesia um probably here there you go massive news um and actually you've got just an enormous junk of the world's population is voting next year right and you got EU elections as well and you know actually just these issues are right in front of us you know next year is where big elections across the globe probably the first set of Elections where this has been a real issue yeah um so figuring out how we manage that is I think kind of mission critical for people who want you know the Integrity of our democracy yeah I mean some of it is it's quite interesting like the Pope in the puffer jacket have you seen that one I haven't that's amazing but I mean I still run into people who who who think that's real um I'm like well what are the odds he's wearing a puffa jacket in July in Rome uh you know be sweating but it actually look quite quite dashing I say um in fact I think AI fashion is going to be a real thing so so I Doom and Gloom like we live in the most interesting times and I think this is um it is you know like 80% likely to be good and 20% bad and I think we're if we're cognizant and and careful about the bad part on balance actually it will be the future that we want um or the the future that is preferable um and and it actually will be somewhat of a leveler an equalizer in the sense that you know I think everyone will have access to goods and services and education and so you know I think probably it leads to more human happiness so I I guess I'd probably leave on on an optimistic note perfect yeah I that's a well that's a that is a great note to end on I think that you know we all want that that better future we think it's there the promise of it is certainly there lot people in this room including yourselves are working hard to make it happen our job in government is to make sure it happens safely but on the basis of this conversation in the last couple of days I'm certainly leaving more confident that we can make that happen so it's been a huge privilege and pleasure to have you here thank you very much for having [Applause] me
Namf-Ddo_Xo,I bought a freeze dryer so you don&#39;t have to,Just understand what you're signing up for. links 'n' stuff Technology Connextras (the second channel where I put stuff sometimes) ...,Technology Connections,2024-10-31T18:26:32Z,28,[],PT1H15S,2147120,13352,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)']",True,"so I bought a freeze dryer it's quite Sublime and in this video I intend to tell you all about the process of freeze drying then of course I'll show you the parts of this machine and explain how they work together to turn ordinary ice cream into astronaut ice cream and it's not just a dry subject it's cool too and it will leave you gasping for air but first a friendly word of warning unless you want to absolutely wreck your YouTube recommendations do not under any circumstances click on any recommended videos you may see next to this one about freeze drying or freeze dryers you will open quite the rabbit hole which unless you're big into the prepper Community you might regret and on that note it makes me wretch a little bit whenever I say it out loud but I do know that I am an in an INF I hate it so much an influencer but but I'm really not about people wasting their money so I'm going to come right out of the gate and say you should almost certainly not buy one of these and to be clear not because it's a bad product this is not I have relatively few complaints about this thing it works reasonably well and honestly I think it's actually pretty remarkable that it's a product you can buy and have in your home but it's just way too expensive to be a rational purchase and if I didn't have this job where I get to Tinker with cool stuff and make videos about it I know with certainty that I would absolutely regret spending the money I spent on this machine I won't bury the lead this was nearly $3,000 which is way too expensive for what I think is mostly a toy and if you're earnestly looking to store large amounts of food for long-term safekeeping I think you'll find much wiser and much less irritating ways to spend your money and time but we'll get to that later first what is freeze drying also known as lyophilization or cryo desiccation it's a process of removing moisture from well technically anything but most normally food and we do it not just because it does funny things to food though that's certainly one of the reasons but also because it prevents spoilage for incredibly long periods of time food spoilage typically happens thanks to one of two things oxidation of fats and oils can turn some foods rancid and since there's oxygen in our atmosphere that tends to happen with time but more pertinent to freeze drying just as you and I got to eat the world's microorganisms like bacteria and mold do too and they'll happily Chow Down on the same Foods we eat decomposing them in the process and in many cases leaving that food unsafe for us to eat those microorganisms though don't just need food to stay alive they also need water so if you can remove enough moisture from a food product you'll end up with food that's simply too dry for those microorganisms to exist on and so it doesn't spoil now there are plenty of ways to make that happen you've probably seen food dehydrators which turn fresh fruit and vegetables into dried fruit and vegetables and once dried that food is much more resistant to spoilage from microbial growth but that process uses heat and adding efficient heat energy to dehydrate Foods in our atmosphere ends up changing the molecular structure of some food components which Alters not only the nutritional value but also the taste now there are plenty of food preservation techniques out there there's canning there's home canning though personally I find calling that canning to be somewhat jarring there's curing there's pickling there's fermenting there's freezing and a lot of other stuff which we don't have time for but most of those techniques end up doing something thing which messes with the flavor structure and nutritional content of the food in many cases it does pretty cool stuff a lot of preservation techniques impart unique flavor profiles that we actually like and there are endless cultural Traditions out there which stand the test of time on Flavor alone but if you're looking to preserve food without actually affecting its flavor or nutritional content while your options are limited that is of course unless you do a little cryo desiccation you know about dry ice right dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide and it has a peculiar Quirk it doesn't melt into liquid instead it sublimates directly from the solid form into the gaseous form that's why we call it dry ice it's ice though extremely cold ice which can't get anything wet because it doesn't melt it just shrinks now usually you can't get water to do that water is wet or or does it make things are we settled on that anyway frozen water doesn't sublimate into water vapor it melts into liquid water don't take my word for it just watch this ice cube see it's melting except this isn't always the case wet ice uh ordinary frozen water will actually sublimate in certain conditions if the ambient temperature surround ing some mass of ice remains below the freezing point of water ice will slowly sublimate and transition directly to the vaporous form this is probably not a perfectly scientifically correct way to explain it but it's similar to how liquid water will evaporate slowly and disappear even at cool room temperatures solid water actually does the same thing and you've seen the effects of this yourself freezer burn where food stored in the freezer for a long time develops dry spots is the result of sublimation the moisture in that cut of meat or whatever just sublimated away and if you've got a bin of ice in your freezer and notice that over time the ice cubes seem to shrink that's also sublimation in action you've probably noticed though that the process is very slow it can be sped up which if you live in cold parts of the world like I do and you drive a car you might have actually noticed Drive high speed on a very cold day and over time little bits of ice stuck to the windshield end up just shrinking until they disappear and that's sublimation happening helped Along by the huge volume of air which keeps flying past that ice as you drive but there's a way to make it happen even faster than that expose ice to a vacuum which brings us back to the freeze dryer this thing may look like a cross between a tiny washing machine and a piece of of lab equipment but it's not just looks the huge rubber ring on the front of this machine engages with the plexiglass door to form an airtight seal and that door is very thick in fact it's so thick that it is strong enough to withstand the roughly 1500 lb or 680 kg of force the atmosphere is going to exert on it when this here vacuum pump sucks all the air out of that chamber because all this thing is is a vacuum chamber but it's also also a freezer if we look inside we'll find that a compressor and fan forced condenser live in the bottom of the machine and this arrangement of Parts is a very typical setup for small self-contained Refrigeration units you might find in a commercial kitchen but the evaporator the part of a refrigeration circuit that gets cold is integrated into the walls of the vacuum chamber now that could be seen as just a practical way to make a freezer if we ignore the whole it's also a vacuum chamber part this might as well be a weird take on a chest freezer it's just on its side and a cylinder rather than a box but specifically for freeze drying it has a practical purpose too which I'll explain later on the basic process this machine uses to freeze dry things begins simply by freezing whatever you want to freeze dry when you start a cycle using its touchscreen interface it turns on the condensing unit and begins cooling the chamber the the actual stuff you intend to freeze dry has to be placed on these trays which are sized just right to fit within the rack structure sitting in the middle of the chamber that rack structure is more than meets the eye but hold that thought for now you can choose to let the machine itself freeze the items on the tray though that takes it quite a while in my experience something like 6 hours so it's generally better to pre-freeze everything in an ordinary freezer first that's speeds up the freeze drying process it still takes a lot of time to freeze everything and uh it's kind of awkward to fit these in some freezers but generally it's better to do that the machine has a temperature sensor attached to that rack structure so it can determine the temperature in the chamber and to some extent the contents in the trays being made of thermally conductive aluminum and also being in physical contact with these trays that sensors reading will be influenced by the temperature of the food and once it has reached the target freezing temperature the machine starts a timer both the target temperature and that timer's length are customizable but currently I have the machine set to a0o Fahrenheit Target that's- 18 c typical freezer temperatures and the extra freeze timer is set for 90 minutes once those 90 minutes are up all of the moisture in whatever you're trying to freeze dry will have frozen solid and the machines next step is to switch on the external vacuum pump by energizing the power outlet on the back of the machine this vacuum pump is quite a beast and can Evacuate the air in the chamber very quickly generally within a minute the pressure drops below 2500 milor which is about 0.05 PSI and for context the atmosphere is 14.7 PSI at sea level from here on out the machine will keep the vacuum pump running continuously and it will keep the compressor running too and now the frozen water in all of the food begins to sublimate except remember that whole thing about how sublimation is a really slow process well it is the vacuum conditions inside the chamber will speed it up but it's still going to take forever if all we do is let the machine sit so here's where that strange rack situation comes into play the racks are not just supporting the trays they also contain heating pads bonded to the underside of each shelf including the top piece is a roughly 150 watt heating pad and once the machine has reached a Target pressure it energizes those pads to heat the food in the chamber now this might seem counterproductive we just froze everything why would we heat it back up well under a vacuum frozen water be behaves like dry ice does in our atmosphere it doesn't melt and so we can actually warm up the food and that added energy means the water molecules in that food are vibrating more vigorously which speeds up sublimation the machine switches those heating pads on and off to maintain the tray temperature at roughly 130° F or about 55 Celsius it feels really weird that doing that doesn't melt the water in the food but it doesn't here's a time lapse of the machine freeze drying ice and you'll notice that it's not melting it's just shrinking and disappearing leaving just a trace of dust that dust being the minerals which were dissolved in the Water behind and now it's time to touch on something I said earlier the compressor runs through the entire process which means the whole freezer part of it is still working to cool the walls of the chamber despite the fact that we're heating the food F and there's effectively no air in there what's going on with that well for physics reasons which I don't understand and won't even try to explain the sublimated water vapor which is freed from the food we're Freez drying is attracted to coldness and will deposit itself on the cold walls of the chamber I would have thought the vacuum pump ends up sucking most of that water out but that is apparently not how it works most of it just redeposits on the cold walls and so you get quite a lot of ice build up as the cycle continues aside from the bit of frost that formed at the beginning of the cycle all that ice used to be the water inside the food that we're freeze drying here's a fun fact while those heaters do speed this process up it still takes forever this machine has typically spent at least 16 hours in the drying step of the process before it determines that it's done it is not fast however once its cycle is complete the machine will move on to extra dry time another step you can change the length of if you like and you might need to as I'll explain later uh but once that timer is done well it's done the machine very faintly beeps at you to kind of get your attention but all it does is turn off the heaters and the vacuum pump the refrigeration circuit will continue to run until you acknowledge that it's done and I believe that's just to make sure none of the ice which forms on the walls melts and gets on your freeze-dried stuff once you decide whether you want the machine to defrost for you or not I'll explain that later it shuts down and it's up to you to open this drain valve and let air back into the chamber once the pressure is equalized you can open the door and remove the product the end result of this process is food which has everything it used to have in there except water all the water is gone but the proteins starches sugars flavor compounds everything else is still there and relatively untouched most Foods end up shrinking slightly and some foods really do not survive this process all that well but for the most part you end up with strange results the food this used to be watermelon becomes almost weightless and the texture is radically different but it's still the same food and if you eat some you'll discover that it tastes exactly like you'd expect but the mouth feel is radically altered and in many cases it's so wrong that the food is quite unappetizing but that food is now shelf stable for up to 25 years it takes special packaging considerations to attain that extreme longevity mainly you need completely airtight packaging with an oxygen absorbing packet thrown in to make sure it doesn't oxidize so do not take that as G possible and at the risk of getting ahead of myself I think this process is a little too variable to actually guarantee that the end result will be safe for anywhere near that long but food preservation is not why I got this machine I just wanted to play around with a freeze dryer and see what sorts of strange foods I could create with it and after literal months of tinkering I'm afraid that most of what I've done is ruin a lot of food and in hindsight that probably shouldn't be surprising given the mechanism in play here I think it's fair to describe the process of freeze drying as accelerated freezer burn taken to completion you forget about something in the freezer for a couple years and when you dig it back up the edges are all crinkly and gross and that's literally what this machine does to food but all of it all the way through sometimes the end result is legitimately interesting and plenty of fruits are strangely delicious once freeze dried like strawberries or pineapple I'm surprised how much I like freeze-dried cantaloupe it's got a nice Crunch and freeze-dried kiwi fruit was another Smash Hit though quite sour but most other things you freeze dry end up being rather unpalatable and so require further work to reconstitute into something less gross if you actually want to eat it take for example and I apologize in advance to the vegetarians and vegans watching meat this is freeze dried sliced ham in its current state it is nearly weightless has a rough texture and is quite brittle you can snap pieces of it off quite easily if you just eat this which I have it's disgusting the dried meat has a quite off-putting gritty texture and to make matters worse it eagerly absorbs the saliva in your mouth and so it's kind of like you're eating damp sand but what makes it even stranger is that it tastes exactly like ham it's just a viscerally confusing experience and I can't describe it any other way than just wrong this here is a meal from McDonald's which I threw in the freeze dryer because my morbid curiosity got the better of me it's just your standard two cheeseburger meal but with some McNuggets too and the end result is incredibly weird give this container a good whiff and it smells like the inside of the McDonald's get more specific and you can make out the smell of the ketchup and onions on the cheeseburger but the cheeseburger itself is now a rock hard disc of misery and now you will get the pleasure of watching my actual reaction to eating some of this food for the first time all right I lied a little bit I have already tried the fries and they are um well it's something like a Sho string potato chip but it does taste like a McDonald's french fry and it's a little too brittle so not great but I haven't tried anything else let's see what a freeze-dried McNugget is oh that's unpleasant okay a oh there it is it took a while for the flavor to come through it's a McNugget but it's like powdery not great um and let's just I don't know how I'm going to do this I don't really even want to do this I mean it tastes like a McDonald's cheeseburger it really does but it's wrong it's not a good experience so what can you do to reconstitute your freeze-dried food into something not gross well the most obvious thing is to add water but depending on how you do that it can be weird perhaps the most surprising thing I accidentally discovered had to do with the ham I thought the most logical thing to do was of course use a steamer to make some delicious steamed hams but when I put the sliced ham into the steamer within moments it started getting darker and by the end of just 5 minutes in there it had cooked further and become the consistency of jerky it was also pretty tasty I won't lie and so I guess I discovered a really odd roundabout way of making jerky from store-bought ham but to get the ham turned back into the regular ham it used to be well simply soaking it in water for a while kind of worked but it got unfortunately soggy in the process like I imagine if I had left the not freeze-dried ham in a bowl of water for a half hour it would have been a similar result I have yet to test this but I do want to try getting one of those cool mist humidifiers and leaving the freeze-dried product in the Stream of mist for a while to see if that might be more pleasant I will almost certainly be doing more stuff related to this on connextras uh so be sure to subscribe to that channel if you haven't already another thing I haven't yet tried steaming is a steamed ham but I do have this freeze-dried steamed ham handy so let's do it it's an Albany expression okay let's steam a steamed ham I got out my simmer stat box I bet you didn't think this was going to come out again but no I'm using it right now and I'm turning the heat down to about medium because I want to leave this in a pretty low heat I hopefully don't want to cook it any further like what happened with the ham I'm putting in the one that I already took a bite out of and we'll throw in one of the Nuggets too how long should I leave it in there for no idea but I'm going to try 10 minutes so tick tick tick tick it's been 10 minutes except I threw in some fries I forgot about that I'll give them a little more time oh i d i dripped some water on the McNugget let me just uh okay that does not bode well it's still stiff it's still stiff but oh oh no it's not it's not good and it has cooked further oh boy I mean I think it's better than it was but um it has cooked further let me turn that off grab one of these fries oh that's awful I now have that set to low so this should barely simmer at all um and we'll see if that makes a difference okay there's 10 minutes of steaming at very low I did it again why did I do that I'm just making a mess over here okay um h no this is still pretty dry so uh it hasn't cooked further so maybe if I let this go for like an hour it would turn into or turn back into what I expect out of a chicken McNugget which is not much to be clear but um steaming apparently does not work hooray there are some foods which can be freeze-dried and then unfreeze dried pretty easily something that I found actually quite enjoyable was Freez drying eggs this one qu mason jar has three dozen eggs in it and I made it by using two freeze dryer trays cracking 18 eggs into each one and then I poked each yolk with a fork to make sure the membrane had broken don't know if that was really necessary but I figured it wouldn't hurt then I carefully put the eggy trays in my freezer I bought these Lids from the manufacturer specifically for making prep easier it allows you to stack the trays in your freezer and if for some reason you end up thinking a freeze dryer is a good idea I would say this is a required accessory uh but anyway after spending the night in my freezer I put the trays in the freeze dryer and ran a cycle the next day because may I remind you this process takes an entire day uh the machine was done and the end result is a much lighter tray filled with nothing but solids of egg using a fork you can scoop these up from the tray and stick them into a food processor and with a little bit of food processing you end up with a varify powder it's quite compressable so I was able to shove all the eggs into this single jar and to turn them back into regular eggs Just Add Water I never bothered figuring out what exactly the proper ratio of powdered freeze-dried egg to water is I've just been eyeballing it but it quite easily turns back into liquefied eggs and with just a bit of stirring and they cook up just like eggs do I scrambled some reconstituted eggs and you would have no idea that they were ever freeze dried other than the fact that they were a perfectly uniform yellow thanks to how thoroughly scrambled they become from the food processor which fun fact the French call it a robot culiner how delightful another actually kind of useful for food preservation thing is this this used to be a half gallon of whole milk but now it's powdered milk this was made using the exact same process as the eggs however it's harder to turn this back into liquid milk I'm pretty certain that's because this is whole milk and much of these solids are milk fat which doesn't really like mixing with water but I wanted to try this specifically because powdered whole milk is a surprisingly hard product to find in my area and I don't normally keep milk in the house because it spoils too quickly for how I use it though perhaps the difficulty in getting this to dissolve in water explains why non-fat powdered milk is more common anyway it will turn back into milk when mixed with water it just takes quite a lot of mixing and since it's milk mechanical AIDS can end up frothing it so it's tough speaking of freeze drying liquids though another thing I did was freeze dry some brewed coffee instant coffee is really just dehydrated coffee but most instant coffee is awful so since I have this high-tech anything dehydrator I figured I'd make my own instant coffee but with a Twist I froze the coffee as I prepare it with cream and sugar so the end result should be truly instant coffee exactly how I like it the process was basically the same for eggs and milk though the end result out of the freeze dryer is truly almost weightless and if it weren't for the sugar I'd be afraid of drafts in the room but you just load it into a food processor and turn it into a powder this is the result which I haven't tried yet let's do that now okay this will not be scientific I just used the scale here at and teared it with this empty mason jar which then suggests there's 43 G of coffee powder in here I'm not 100% confident that this is four or two mugs I don't remember I think it's only two because of the sugar in here I would be really shocked if I only have 10 g of sugar and milk fat so I'm going to put half of this in that mug we'll see what happens I'm not bothering to wait till this gets to a boil so it's dissolving pretty well it hasn't completely dissolved perfectly but this does other than the froth look very much like how I brew my coffee and uh it doesn't have that acrid smell that most instant coffee really does for me so let me give it a taste be mindful of the spoon this is very good this is effectively how I take my coffee in the morning I'm going to call that a success yeah it's got for whatever reason the froth that's forming on here it almost it almost has a whipped hot chocolate consistency on the top but it's very good am I going to actually make a bunch of this for future use no but now let's change gears the main reason I bought this thing aside from making a video was to try freeze drying whatever seemed like it might be fun to freeze dry but I learned pretty quickly that a lot of stuff just doesn't really work I knew some of that going into this I didn't just buy a freeze dryer I did some research into what can and cannot be freeze dried so I knew that things with very little moisture content and high fat content just don't work uh chocolate for instance just ends up melting once the heaters turn on same goes for butter but there were also a lot more Duds than I figured would be the case in fact it's been mostly Duds the very first round of freeze drying I did included all sorts of stuff some of which I just thought would be funny uh for instance I wanted to freeze dry a Twinkie just because that idea was hilarious on its face sadly I never got around to making freeze dried refried beans uh but anyway much of that first batch just didn't actually do anything or was completely ruined the Twinkies just became rock hard and impossible to eat the cream filling of the Oreos melted and the cookies just turned stale Little Debbie Oatmeal cream pies had the filling become a powder and the oatmeal cookie parts turned into the consistency of a cracker crossed with an old Ginger Snap none of that was any good so anything close to a pastry is apparently never going to come out of a freeze dryer in a good way that first round also included various fruits canned pineapple and peaches in addition to a fruit cocktail were done mainly because I already had some on hand and I was lazy but I also bought some cut melon and prepared that for the freeze dryer and I learned some interesting lessons there the peaches freeze dried perfectly the pineapple most ly did but over time it became clear there was still some moisture left in it and the melon well it seemed like maybe it was dry but after a few days in a mason jar well it became clear it was rotting the smell was awful that was on me though the instructions for the freeze dryer make it pretty clear that you don't want any product over the tops of the trays and that melon was very much over the tops of the trays it was just too big which leads me to my next little lesson dealing with these trays is just kind of annoying and freeze drying liquid products is just not really fun the easiest way to do it is to put the empty trays in the freeze dryer then pull them out just enough so you can fill them in place and then slowly push them back in and start the cycle and actually I do have to call out a really clever design feature here you'll notice that the machine is leaning back somewhat that's to allow water in the vacuum chamber to drain when it defrosts at the end of the cycle but the racks for the trays are leaning in the opposite direction to perfectly cancel that out so the actual trays remain level that's really good thinking still dealing with liquids is irritating and means you're asking the freeze dryer to do the initial freeze which makes the already very long cycle even longer so I thought I'd be clever and order some ice cube trays with silicone bottoms and make ice cubes out of whatever liquids I wanted to freeze dry so I made ice cubes of egg milk and coffee this was a mistake probably through some combination of being too tall and not being in solid physical contact with the trays once the machine had finished it turned out that the center core of every Ice Cube still had ice in it so the eggs and milk very very ruined definitely not safe to eat and the coffee well I guess I could have made coffee with it but I ended up just sending it down the drain honestly that was a real bummer I really hoped this would be easier but sure enough liquid product in direct contact with the trays is what you have to do and the lessons just kept on happening during one freeze drying session where I tried such things as black olives weird but okay dill pickles not good carrots surprisingly disgusting yogurt more weird than anything else balls of seasoned and cooked rice disappointing and other stuff I'm sure I've forgotten I had some lemon and lime slices in there those came out perfectly and aside from the pucker Factor made for an interesting little treat so later on I was doing some other fruits and stuff and decided to put in both some sliced tangerines and Mandarin oranges and for some reason neither of those actually dried to completion everything else in there came out fine but the oranges did not they had a good deal of their moisture removed but after storing them in a Ziploc bag by the next day the bag had condensation on the insides and the fruit had turned into mush I can only assume the sugar content of this is just too high or something and remember how that first run of freeze drying had a can of fruit cocktail in there the grapes in that fruit Co tail ended up being really interesting so I went out to the store and got some fresh grapes to try I had assumed the skin of the grape might be a problem so I poked each and every one with a knife before freeze drying I had both seedless green and red grapes in there and well they barely dried at all there was some unpleasant oozing coming out of the holes I made in the skin the whole time and by the time the cycle had ended they were still mostly grapes so then I decided to cut the grapes in half and try again cutting grapes in half it turns out is really annoying but I figured that would work and I think it did but and here comes the bad news the end result was really really gross like I don't understand how they took on the flavors they did and the grapes themselves were fine I had some while prepping them because of course I did and they were delicious but out of the freeze dryer they were not but rather than dwell on the bad stuff now let's talk about some of the better things I was able to do with the freeze dryer the most surprisingly good thing onions just raw onions they leave the freeze drying process with the texture of a potato chip so with just a little bit of salt and oil they might as well be all natural funions I tried this only because I once bought these onion chips from Trader Joe's and the the ingredients were just onions bran oil and salt and the bag was a bit Cy about the process used to create them so I tried freeze drying an onion and I'm reasonably sure that was the process they were very similar to the product from TJ's I did do a run where I roasted some in the oven for a bit before freeze drying them and that didn't seem to make much of a difference as far as the flavor goes but I suppose one thing I do need to try now is caramelizing a bunch of onions and then and freeze dry them H I also cryo desicated various Peppers two Bell one jalapeno these ended up with a similar chip-like consistency to the onions though personally I found them to be less enjoyable and the jalapeno maybe I just lucked out and got a particularly spicy one but that was an intense vegetable chip and yes I am a midwesterner and I look like this I know that but normally I like jalapenos on stuff and find them fairly mild so either freeze drying really accentuates the capin or I just got quite a banger from the store many candies also do interesting things in the freeze dryer turns out Skittles they pop like popcorn they split in half and the innards puff up and the end result it's got a nice crunch gummy candies tend to really explode in size these here were gummy bears these were gummy worms and these were gummy sharks we'll never speak of that again these are less fun to eat I would describe the texture as almost like a candied glass dentists would definitely have some thoughts about this interestingly though not all gummies do this I had some peach rings which I ran through here and their texture was altered slightly but they didn't grow in size and I also ran some spice drops through the freeze dryer and they were completely unaffected what's up with that no idea and then of course there's astronaut ice cream I don't have to go to the Science Museum gift shop anymore I can make it at home that was totally worth buying this thing anyway freeze drying ice cream is actually somewhat difficult to get right the first time I tried it I just put in a few store-bought ice cream sandwiches but I put them in too early the chamber wasn't cold enough and while they didn't look like they were melting at all and perhaps they weren't initially the inside of them liquefied at some point and it was unpleasant I tried some of the same sandwiches later making sure to let the chamber get well below freezing first and they came out exactly as you would expect actually quite a lot better than the stuff you can buy in a store and later I just tried some smatterings of ice cream that I had smashed onto one of the trays which I let stay in the free freezer for several hours and uh it came out fine though the Cherry filling in this did expand a little bit like the candies the next question is do I actually like astronaut ice cream and the answer is not really I mean it's kind of fun but it wears off pretty quickly so now let's get back to the whole utilitarian aspect of things a big selling point of these very expensive and slow machines is that they can preserve a wide iy of food effectively forever and that's essentially true but I want to pick that apart because if you step back and look a little holistically at this situation I simply cannot find owning one of these to be rational maybe that sounds blunt but if this looks like a good idea to you our mental Frameworks are just completely misaligned when it comes to the value of time money and effort and also at the risk of getting a little deep you might be worrying a little too much about the apocalypse why do I say that firstly just getting and using this thing is a commitment it was shipped via Freight on a pallet and I bought this workbench specifically for it no it's not huge but it's very heavy there's a reason it's not here on my desk and you are not going to want this in your kitchen remember how way back at the start I said its condensing unit was the same sort of thing you find in small commercial refrigerators yeah well this thing is [Applause] loud the droning of the condenser fan matches the most annoying vending machine at the bus stop and it will run the whole time and then the vacuum pump starts up and it just adds to the racket the vacuum pump is actually a lot quieter than I expected so that's good but it's still more noise and it will not stop for at least 12 [Music] hours you're going to want this thing in a garage or a basement and unless you've got one of those basement kitchens that's going to be annoying when it comes to the prep required to actually use the freeze dryer nextly this process proc is extremely energy intensive over a cycle the machine uses about 16 kwatt hours it varies a bit depending on what exactly you're freeze drying but it's been pretty close to 16 every run that I've tested that's about $2 worth of electricity for every cycle and that same quantity of energy will power my car for three round trips of my commute I do have a somewhat short commute it's about 20 m round trip trip but quite literally if I used this thing every day it would be using three times as much energy as my car does during the summer months anyway and it would cost about 60 bucks a month yikes and if you'd like me to make a different comparison a typical 7 cubic foot chest freezer needs just about 650 wat hours per day meaning one freeze dry cycle uses as much energy as a freezer does over 25 days and to really drive this point home this is the second smallest unit Harvest Right cells and the larger machines have a Nema 520 plug on them that's the one with the sideways blade which will only fit into Outlets like this on a 20 amp circuit these things just need a stupid amount of power to run all those heaters in addition to the compressor and vacuum pump oh and speaking of the vacuum pump that thing needs maintenance it has oil in it and every 20 Cycles the oil needs to be drained and filtered luckily they included an oil filtration system with the freeze dryer and what is that you ask it's a brda pitcher it's literally an off-brand brida pitcher honestly this made me laugh out loud when I saw it uh the machine it will prompt you to do that maintenance when required and this company does sell an oilfree vacuum pump which does not need this maintenance but that's a $1500 upcharge yeah and what about the time part in case you haven't noticed you can't actually freeze dry all that much food at one time this company's website claims the machine can process 10 to 15 pounds of fresh food per batch which to be honest I don't doubt at all but you're only going to be able to do one batch per day and while the machine itself is mostly set and forget the prep work absolutely is not it's a chore and since the trays are going to be in the machine for the next 16 to 24 hours you can't prep the next batch unless you buy a second set of trays which I did because even just playing with this thing for the purposes of this video was tedious enough to make a second set of trays worth having and by the way you can't start your next batch for 2 hours because you need to let the machine run its tray heaters to defrost the insid and get rid of all that ice it's a lot of work but then you're not even done when the machine is done you have to package everything you just freeze-dried if you actually want it to stay preserved and that's more work and time you're going to have to spend plus more money on whatever sort of packaging solution you want to go with and of course the company will happily sell you packaging supplies from myar bags to oxygen absorbing packets though to be honest their pricing is quite reasonable so I'm not actually mad about that I'm just saying if you you actually intend to preserve lots of food with one of these understand what you're signing yourself up for it's a lot of work and a huge time commitment and that's before you even consider where you're going to put all this food I do not have the pantry space for the end result of a Year's worth of freeze drying and to drive the absurdity point home let's just compare this freeze dryer with a conventional freezer it's not a perfect comparison and I know that uh for one thing not all food is suitable for storage in a freezer and while they can technically store food indefinitely freezer burn does damage stuff with time but for the sake of argument let's just say you had $2800 to spend on food preservation stuff you could buy this or well remember that basic 7 cubic foot chest freezer I mentioned earlier those cost about $200 they're commodity items and you can get them for about that price from many different retailers and that size usually has the smallest dollar cost per cubic foot so let's just say we'll get 10 of those if you're thinking you're going to be freeze drying food all year you definitely have some sort of Bunker which can fit 10 chest freezers so let's not dwell too much on where you're going to put all of them plus you could build some shelves and stack them probably actually you could definitely just stack a few onto top of each other if you know for sure you don't need to get to anything in the bottom ones until 2028 anyway congratulations now you've got 70 cubic feet of frozen food storage but wait you say freezers need electricity to function so what if the power goes out well lucky for you you still have $800 left over to buy yourself a portable generator you can run to your local Harbor Freight and pick up one of these bad boys and you'll still have some po money left for a gas can a few gallons of gas extension cords and power strips and it will absolutely take care of all those chest freezers those things only use about 80 Watts when they're running so as long as they don't all start at the exact same time and overwhelm the generator with their required starting current you're going to have plenty of power available for all of them plus your kitchen fridge and some lights in the TV and whatever else I have lived through extended power outages off a smaller generator than this so I do actually know what I'm talking about here and if I were a Gambling Man I think it's a pretty solid bet to assume that anyone actually looking at one of these freeze dryers to use unironically as a means to build up long-term food storage already has a generator again I know the comparison to a freezer is not entirely perfect but another thing to consider about them is that you just put stuff in them and that's it you're done if you're like doing your own butchering and packaging then sure there is more than zero prep in packaging cost but I can all but guarantee you will be spending much much less time stocking 10 freezers especially since you don't need to thinly slice everything to make sure it doesn't stick up above the edges of these trays now I don't want to sound too negative this freeze dryer is truly a fine product which I would recommend were it not for the rather huge fact that the math just isn't mathing if your brain allows you to think it does by all means have at it but if you've watched this video and still think a freeze dryer is something you need in your life our brains work real different I think that if somebody were to make a really small freeze dryer which only cost a few hundred bucks it would be easy for me to say sure play around with a freeze dryer some foods are fun to freeze dry but the market right now is basically just variations on this machine and the pricing is fairly uniform which makes sense this really is lab equipment and not really a kitchen appliance and honestly that's really what makes me so uncomfortable about this whole thing they're being sold now as if they are the next Air fryer and like no you don't need this it's going to be a massive commitment and unless you've got a lot of disposable income and time I truly think this is not a smart purchase having said that the last things I'll touch on before I wrap this video up are the little annoyances with this particular machine and the process more generally for any freeze dryer the Seal of the vacuum chamber door is very important it doesn't need to be exactly perfect once the vacuum pump kicks on the atmosphere does a fine job of holding that door in place but the seal needs to be good enough for the vacuum pump to overcome whatever air might leak past it when it starts up and on this machine the door latch and hinge design is not that great for making sure the seal stays flat it has three attachment points which effectively mean it's a tripod but should you need to make any adjustment you'll soon discover that only two of them are adjustable the latch isn't adjustable at all at least not without bending anything and it doesn't really form a very tight seal and while you can adjust the hinges they have a design which allows the door to move inward somewhat which makes sense that's going to happen when the vacuum pump switches on but it makes adjusting them a nightmare out of the box this thing didn't need any adjustment but on that first cycle it was fairly warm out in the warehouse and I had not pre-frozen anything so it ran for more than 6 hours just freezing the food I had put inside in that time combined with the warm room ice was beginning to form behind the Rubber seal outside of the vacuum chamber which started pushing the seal forward and making the contact points with the door uneven so I started fiddling with the hinges and that's when I discovered how nightmarish this adjustment is I truthfully don't know what's the bigger issue here the fact that some ice forms on the outside of the vacuum chamber and deforms the seal or the weird hinges I have found that always pre-freezing the trays mostly eliminates the icing problem if they're at freezer temps when you load them in the machine only spends about two hours before it switches on the vacuum pump and once it starts the vacuum pump so long as the seal is good the hinges and latch don't even matter anymore but I'm also shoving a piece of cardboard under the latch every time I start it to make sure the seal is tight and I really don't feel like I should have to do that with such an expensive machine the other problem is a little more serious I cannot for the life of me figure out how it determines the cycle is complete once it moves to the drying step the most useless progress bar I have ever encountered shows up on the screen that bar will move in completely unpredictable ways sometimes it only fills up about a third of the way and then the machine decides I'm done and now you're in extra dry time and other times it seems to fill up pretty normally but then gets stuck at the end like a Windows machine I had presumed that the machine is probably monitoring the vacuum pressure as it turns the heaters on and off my intuition was that each time the heaters switch on the vacuum pressure goes up slightly because more water is sublimating so it's just looking for those little spikes to stop happening because when all the water's gone that won't happen anymore but after several time-lapse sessions with the GoPros it's clear it's not doing that but what it is doing ain't any clearer on this batch it was barely into the fifth hour of the whole cycle when it suddenly decided extra dry time I'm done and uh when I saw that I literally said to it no you are not luckily you're able to just bump up the extra dry time which I did until it got to like 17 hours because I knew there was no stinking way that batch which had a lot of watermelon in there was anywhere near complete this is also the batch with the tangerines and mandarins and you could tell just by looking at them that they were still bubbling and the fact that the vacuum gauge was reading in the 400s when it thought it was done when on other Cycles it was in the 100s when that happened means I have absolutely no idea what algorithm in there is running I mean on this cycle I was literally just freeze drying four trays of ice with one tray of jello and all the ice had completely disappeared and yet it's still thought it's not done I just have no idea what it's looking for ah however I must actually give it a little credit there I ended this session manually because I was sick and tired of waiting for it and I wanted to go home and when I removed the trays I ate a few of the Jell-O pieces freeze-dried strawberry Jell-O has a crunch and taste which is shockingly similar to the crunch berries and Cat and Crunch cereal but sadly after a few seconds the gelatin flavor comes through and ruins it but anyway some of those Jello-O pieces still had a bit of ice in the center so the machine was actually right the process was not complete but it also revealed how inconsistent the process itself is all of the ice cubes had completely disappeared but the freeze-dried Jell-O apparently functioned something like aerogel and made an insulating layer which prevented the heaters from actually heating the center of each piece I chomped on one right as I took it out and the center was still ice cold despite the tray itself being hot I find this really interesting but also a little concerning when it comes to the actual safety of the food you freeze dry in fact that whole part of this process just gives me the heebie jeebies I would make sure to sample everything which I had run through the freeze dryer to make sure it was actually thoroughly dry before I moved on to packaging it for long-term storage I just can't trust the machine's judgment the manufacturer clearly wants this to be a one button set and forget experience the documentation this came with is really light on details and I would call this a quick start guide not an owner's manual and all it says is the machine is measuring the removal and moisture and knows when the process is complete but I'm pretty sure a one button experience just isn't a reasonable expectation for this sort of machine and they know that they too suggest checking everything to be sure it's dry and for what it's worth you are able to put the food back in the machine and resume the process if it's not done there is a USB input on the side so presumably the software could be updated this is apparently running version 5.4 and I will leave open the possibility that something is actually wrong with this particular unit but I have a theory as to what's going on and I think it's an unsolvable problem both the manual and demonstrations of this product on their website imply that mixing products in here is fine to do but I'm a little skeptical of that I have not removed the rack structure because it would involve messing with the seal which I really don't want to do so I can't say this with certainty but I believe these two rivets here are holding the temperature sensor for the tray rack and that means it's influenced by what is on those trays and which order you loaded them in if you put trays with more stuff and or more wet stuff on them farther from that sensor it may think it's done early because a lighter dryer tray was closer to it I definitely know from all my testing that if the overall mass of the food on each tray varies a lot from tray to tray the machine is more likely to be confused it may end too early or it may go on a lot longer than it needs to and what's most interesting about that to me is that this isn't explained at all in the machine's owner's manual but truly I don't want to sound too hard on this product or this company I actually quite like it and so long as you're aware of the fact that it might end the cycle too early and you're on the lookout for that it's truly a fine machine and while it was hideously expensive for what it is I think the price is actually reasonable what I don't think is reasonable though at least in my opinion is ordinary people having one of these in their home it's either a very expensive toy which you'll probably get sick of using before too long or if you seriously think this is worth having for nearly indefinite food storage understand the many commitments you will be making before you pull the trigger I'll wrap up now but let me reiterate the commitment thing you are signing up for hours and hours of tedious work to use this thing as an actual food storage tool and at the risk of getting a little spicy if your spouse is trying to convince you this is a great purchase make sure they are willing to help put in the work I'm already quite confident that I would resent a partner who bought this for me and presumed I would have a fun time using it every day but that's just me thanks for [Music] watching unless you're big into the prepper Community you might regret I said pepper of fats and oils can turn some foods rancid and then there's oxygen in our and since there's oxygen in our atmosphere water is wet or does it make things are we settled on that anyway for vibrating more vigorously which speeds up the and I made it by using two freeze dryer [Music] frease now we're falling apart has a nice crunch gummy candies tend to really explode in size these I can't continue that take huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]"

wolf Gan Von kemplin built and unveiled a self-operating chess playing machine called The Mechanical Turk in demonstrations around Europe his chess playing invention won most of its games against actual human chess players and it's even said that it went on to beat players like Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin naturally The Invention was extremely popular a Marvel of its day however it was actually just some guy under the table secretly operating the machine in other words it was a hoax some 250 years later in 2016 Amazon pulled a similar stunt their checkout system called just walk out allowed customers to Simply grab items from the store and leave under this system customers didn't have to manually scan their items at the checkout the transactions and Logistics were automatically taken care of behind the scenes by AI An Elegant combination of Compu Vision sense of fusion and deep learning or was it just like the Mechanical Turk all was not as it seemed Amazon's so-called AI technology was actually powered by a thousand people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts now humans labeling data is often how AI models are first trained and that's fine but the point is the advertising was misleading even by 2022 these 1,000 people were still manually reviewing 70% of of transactions in 20 Amazon go stores 40 Amazon fresh grocery stores and two Whole Food stores although some saw it as dystopian Amazon promoted their just walkout technology as a utopian magical solution powered by Ai and here in lies the problem companies often leave out critical information in the fine print it wasn't until 2023 that Amazon mention the use of the a thousand people in India and it gets worse according to a report by the information other companies were swindled too quote 30 stores operated by other companies in the US sports stadiums 12 airports and one University all used Amazon's walk out technology and this is where things become murky when companies promis revolutionary technology but don't follow up on them it creates distrust but it can even spoil it for those who are doing legitimate work in the field with the AI Revolution that we've seen over the past couple of years there needs to be a more critical look at what's happening with AI in this episode we'll see the reasons for the AI hype and its consequences we'll look at if there is indeed an AI bubble and what real world impact that might be having this includes companies releasing half-baked AI products but also simultaneously replacing actual humans with AI it's a dichotomy of the industry so sit back and relax as we make sense of it all you are watching C Fusion TV one use of AI technology that absolutely nobody is thrilled about is the fact that it can make scammers lives easier AI can help generate convincing texts that try to trick you into clicking a fishing link and then there's the spam emails and Robo calls you've all experienced it but why does it

term AI is really being thrown around everywhere for older cold fusion viewers you'd know that I've been covering AI for the good part of a decade now before 2022 the word artificial intelligence was limited to Industry verbage in obscure research papers the general public didn't know or care and even as late as 21 when I covered gpt3 there was a lot of people that thought I was just making it up how could a computer possibly talk like that well as you all know after 2022 especially following the launch of chat GPT it was a different story from your smartphone to LinkedIn to your local government site a lot of organizations today will boast the term powered by AI while in a lot of cases it makes sense the overuse of the term and it being thrown around so casually is a symptom of something called AI washing AI washing simply put is when companies create a fake buzz and mislead investors by providing manipulative information about the capabilities limitations or risks of their AI products or simply wholesale lie about how and when they're using AI according to Goldman Sachs a record 36% of S&P 500 companies mentioned AI in their Q4 earnings reports if the biggest companies in the world are hyping it up there's no doubt that small companies are following suit and some without tangible results backing up their claims and the Investments are there to match too from 2015 to 20122 Global corporate AI Investments have increased seven times a lot of companies have seen tremendous growth in the recent AI hype and this puts pressure on other companies to integrate AI into their business model or their products in order to compete and that's even if it's not really AI Monkey C Monkey Do For example the Canadian investment firm Delia claimed that that had built an AI to predict upcoming companies and Industry Trends despite not having any such capabilities the SEC caught wind of the scam and has since ordered them to pay $225,000 and this was for false advertising and misleading statements about the use of AI and I have a feeling that this is just the start I previously talked about the wire card fraud where CEO Marcus Brawn boasted about having Advanced proprietary AI throughout their fintech products and services in reality it was just spreadsheets in the end there was $2 billion missing from the books but that was a story for a different day you might have also heard about the npu or neural Processing Unit it's a dedicated processor specifically designed for AI tasks among other things they're becoming increasingly common in the world of PCS and laptops and Microsoft has even claimed that we're now in the age of the AI PC but recent reviews of the current crop of these products have left consumers with a bad taste in their mouth let's talk a bit more about AI yes the Snapdragon processors dominate here but AI is still very nent many people either won't use these tasks all that much or these tasks themselves just don't work that well yet for example they demo generating images of animals and they highlighted how fast the processes were versus Intel but when I look closely at the images generated they were all garbage the AI dogs all had very lopsided eyes so who cares if one of these processors is faster than the other if they are both generating garbage right now I just wouldn't advise anyone buy a laptop based on its AI capabilities a news analyst from computer world has mentioned that these AI PCS aren't quote all they cracked out to be and if you're expecting something transformative when you buy one from the start of 2024 you're going to be disappointed they might one day deliver a lot of cool features just not yet end quote but are there consequences of such misplaced promises other than distrust from customers companies that Miss The Mark with AI product launches are constantly trying to save face even the most popular companies in the world are not immune to mistakes perhaps the biggest consequence of AI washing is a certain b word that might be lurking around the corner almost as soon as AI started going Uber mainstream from late 2022 a lot of people immediately liken the phenomenon to the dotom bubble or even the crypto Fiasco in fact some people still do today even when we talk about the.com Bubble it's not the worldwide web that was the problem because of course you're using a right now instead it was mostly the e-commerce side of things which over promised reeling in investors but underd delivered leading to a crash when everyone realized that the companies that they invested in weren't making any money with AI there's no doubt that we'll see some more investment in the space and Monumental growth too according to Oppenheimer no not the one you're thinking of who's a chief Global Equity strategist at Goldman Sachs research quote we believe we are in the relatively early stages of a new technology cycle that is likely to lead to further outperformance end quote Nvidia who designs the chips that are powering big Tech's AI Revolution is tentative proof of this their stock is up 80% this year alone perhaps excessive but it's indicative of what the market thinks of AI Mark Cuban who made his fortune during the era also doesn't see AI as a bubble in a recent interview with Lex fredman he expressed that the biggest sign that we're not in a bubble is the lack of IPOs in the AI sector also the absence of companies with no intrinsic value going public and the lack of quote funky AI companies is a key indicator he noted that the current market doesn't exhibit such characteristics and I think that I largely agree with that there's obviously some bad players in the industry who are just trying to make a quick Buck but there might be more to it and here's what I mean there's a known pattern for emerging Technologies called the Gartner hype cycle it describes how humans tend to be overzealous about a new revolutionary technology we overestimate and overshoot its impact hype it up until the market crashes and after the crash the real companies with the real value come through and spearhead the development of the new technology until it's mature if we look at the Gardner hype cycle for AI it seems like we're at the closing stages of the peak of inflated expectations and are slowly entering the trough of disillusionment this interpretation of the current market means that there's going to be a lot of disappointment ahead the real applications of AI will come after the hype and fatigue Fades but but this time could be a little bit different because at its core AI has the ability to mimic cognitive labor a change that no previous technology has been able to do without intrinsic human intervention whereas as pointed out in a previous podcast episode during the dot bubble there were a lot of people simply making a random website and going public and investors would throw money at anything with a do at the end of its name there's been a lot of organizations that have been ring to launch AI products or replace humans with AI altogether but the ones who are hastily adding the ever popular quote powered by AI gimmick are failing badly and there have been some spectacular AI failures for example a parcel delivery firm called dpd enabled an AI online chat for answering questions for One customer it was not only useless at answering relevant questions regarding his order but instead when asked it provided him with a poem and swore at him this amazing poem came forth about a dpd chatot who who wasn't able to do anything it was quite amazing it appeared to even disregard its own rules and started swearing and even started dissing its own employer adding dpd is the worst delivery firm in the world I would never recommend them to anyone in Australia a group of academics used AI generated material as part of their complaint submission to the Australian parliament against four of Australia's biggest banks of course the AI made up a whole bunch of information including SC scandals that never existed and implicating deoe when they had nothing to do with the original complaint someone on the team didn't read the entire submission before it went to the Australian government so it was a huge embarrassment and the academics were forced to apologize this is just one of many examples and I'm going to include a website that keeps a running tab of these AI blunders but on the other hand there are companies who are integrating AI successfully and this is where we come to the other kind of broken promise when it comes to AI it's not CEO's over promising ai's usefulness but under promising instead in other words we were told that AI would be our assistant and create new jobs not replace us but what if that's just not true not about replacing the human in the loop in fact it's about empowering the human like it's an assistant it's an assistant this clip from SAA is a bit hard to believe now even though later he did mention the flip side yes I'm sure a lot of us use chat GPT to help get work done on personal projects but AI eventually creating more jobs than it would replace maybe not so fast you may have noticed that since 2022 there's been a lot of tech related layoffs The Narrative is that this is happening due to the over hiring during the pandemic times and that would make sense for 2022 and even 2023 but in 2024 we're still seeing Mass layoffs now if companies were just struggling to make a profit the explanation would be as simple as the common business cycle but strangely some of the biggest companies in the world are seeing record profits they're almost cyclically shedding workers according to reports tech companies fired 165,000 people in 2022 260,000 in 2023 and so far the projection is 270,000 in 2024 so if companies are doing fine why are workers being kicked out the door well marketing professor and author Scott Galloway thinks quote there's something else going on end quote in his recent blog post dissecting the impact of AI on corporations he mentions quote AI is playing a larger role in layoffs than CEOs are willing to admit end quot the normal way we think about Job Replacements caused by AI is that Joe blogs is working at his computer analyzing company figures or something like that and then suddenly the next day he's replaced by an AI but the truth is it's a bit more nuanced than that as companies slowly get better at understanding how AI can Aid in their operations they'll create better teams and structure with higher outcomes basically instead of three people doing the work of three you'll have one person doing the work of five with AI the problem is that none of these companies are being sincere about it because if you're a CEO and you've been hyping up AI as the single greatest thing to happen to the industry and then you follow it up with a memo that you've laid off 30% of your staff because of AI the hypocrisy becomes clear but in 2024 it seems like the truth is slowly coming out and there's hints everywhere IBM made headlines when CEO arvind chrish mentioned that they're planning to pause hiring roles that could be replaced with AI same with UPS where recently their CEO Carol Tom acknowledged that AI is playing a part in employee layoffs and this came after UPS had the largest layoff in its 116e history 12,000 workers in both cases spokes people later clarified saying quote AI is not replacing workers end quote which is basically PR talk to save face in fact a Shopify employee broke their non-disclosure agreement to expose that the company has been secretly firing employees because of AI the shift is even having an impact far outside the tech industry TV and media producer Tyler Perry was building an $800 million Studio expansion but paused its construction after he saw the results of open aiora an AI video generator he made the remark quote I am very very concerned that in the near future a lot of jobs are going to be lost end quote in the last couple of years you probably would have heard this phrase a bit AI will not replace humans but humans who utilize AI replace humans who don't there's definitely some truth to it but some jobs will be at risk regardless we don't have to imagine this it is already happening Mega caps like meta and alphabet they are shrinking their workforces and and shrinking their hiring it's this idea that senior AI researchers or data analysts they can do more with Gen than an army of Junior Engineers who code a recent report from Mackenzie found that around 12 million us workers may need to switch jobs by 2030 lower wage workers are 14 times more likely to be impacted stem Healthcare Builders and professional Fields will continue to add jobs but generative AI could change work significantly for occupations like customer service and sales and office support there's been repeated reports of how AI will be adding hundreds of millions of jobs in the next decade and how it's going to positively impact GDP while by some miracle this could happen right now as has been the case in many times in history the train will leave the station without telling us whether we're aware to jump on board or not is the question so wrapping this all up I do have to mention that in no way am I saying that all forms of AI and all of these giant corporations are elaborate hoaxes in fact on this channel I've been making videos about AI progress for the better part of a decade now and I've seen exponential progress right in front of my eyes and so will many of you we may have hit a temporary bottleneck when it comes to compute but all it takes is a breakthrough in model efficiency and the curve continues upwards but I just think that it's important to still have a cautious approach when it comes to looking at all sides of a story I'm also working on a video that's all about the positive real life impacts of AI so hopefully that's going to balance things out a bit so far it seems like the promises of AI are yet to be fully realized whether that's creating and not taking jobs solving Global issues or even providing us with a Dependable AI customer service spot that doesn't swear at us with such big and bold promises from these companies over the years it's important for all of us to ask ourselves do we have technological gold a trojan horse or a chess master hiding under a table anyways that's about it from me my name is toogo and You' been watching cold fusion if you did like that episode feel free to subscribe there's plenty of

engine', 'liquid nitrogen']",PT9M58S,2005657,1698,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)']",True,"this is Hero's engine it's essentially a steam powered rocket engine that was invented almost 2,000 years ago despite its age Hero's engine uses the same principles that still power modern rockets steam turbines and jet engines and to show you just how powerful this ancient technology can be I'm going to take Hero's engine to the extreme and use it to spin a ping pong ball to over 18,000 RPM Hero's or aola pile as it was originally known was invented by hero of Alexandria around 100 AD it was one of the first examples of thrust 1,600 years before Newton described it let me show you how it works I put some water inside this bulb here if I add enough heat to the bulb the water inside will start to boil and turn to steam this quickly increases the internal pressure the only place that the steam can escape is out these nozzles on the side the steam is exiting the nozzles in this direction so the very last kick the molecules give before sent out of the device pushes the device in the opposite direction causing it to spin for example I can use the same principle if I want to spin in my chair but I don't have anything to push off against if I just throw this weight in this direction I'll be pushed the opposite direction it worked it's the same same principle that Rockets used to get to space in fact you could say that Hero's engine was the first rocket engine even though nobody realized it at the time the nice thing about using thrust to power something is that it doesn't matter how fast you're already going you can always move faster because you're carrying the fuel with you this means that rockets and heroes engine can reach insane speeds with water and fire I clocked my heroes engine at 2500 rpm but let's see what we can get if we make some improve improvements first let's swap out the heavy metal bulb with a much lighter pingpong ball and let's swap out the water for liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen has the benefit that you don't need any fire to turn it into a gas the ambient temperature of the room will do that for you so it's basically like taking a regular Heroes engine and throwing it in a furnace the liquid nitrogen expands by 700 times its original volume when it turns into a gas so let's see what happens first I just need to make a hole for the liquid nitrogen to go in this will also serve as our hole for the gas to come out as well so I'll just make a pin hole in the side and bend it so that it's angled this makes it so the gas isn't just shot straight out but it's coming out at an angle that will turn the pingpong ball then you dunk the pingpong ball in liquid nitrogen as soon as we dunk it in the nitrogen the gas that was inside the ball will shrink significantly due to the rapid cooling this creates a slight vacuum that'll pull in the liquid nitrogen so you're left with a tiny amount of liquid nitrogen inside the ping pong ball now okay so I figure the safest thing to do is to toss it into here at first cuz I'm not sure if it's going to explode okay let's see what happens here W look how fast it's spinning the riding on it just disappears in a blur that's so so cool so how fast is this actually spinning so I colored one side of the ball black and I'm going to use my tachometer to clock the rotational speed here we go oh 11,000 RPM I saw 18,000 13,000 for a set now one thing that'll increase the pressure higher and that's the speed of the exiting nitrogen gas is to heat the ball up faster so let's see what happens when I put it in a shallow dish of warm water [Music] [Applause] [Music] that was fast I wasn't able to clock it but the pitch of it was so much higher than any of the previous ones that I'd done before so I know it was going much faster if some of you smarty pants want to try to figure out the speed based on the pitch of this one compared to the earlier ones where I was measuring the speed let me know in the comments section I couldn't replicate this one with water because most of the time it just stayed in the water and the water significantly flowed down I tried other ways to have it spin with no friction like levitating it on my superconductor [Music] oh but that didn't work very well either oh yeah and one tip if you're ever trying to show the Magnus effect with a 10,000 RPM ping pong ball make sure that the Magnus effect will make it move away from you instead of towards you the ball actually exploded here I found that they don't normally explode but if they have any impacts while they're cold and spinning then they will explode Hero's engine is a fascinating example of using a clever design to create

professional online presence you can try out ODU by clicking the link in my description and thanks to ODU for sponsoring this video now let's get back to our experiment now one question you might have after seeing the experiment with liquid nitrogen is if it can generate power just from the ambient heat in the room why don't we just use liquid nitrogen to power cars and the atmosphere will heat the nitrogen without a need for fuel well liquid nitrogen engines have already been made actually in a piston engine you can have incoming air that gets compressed and that heats up the piston and then you send in liquid nitrogen which then expands and pushes the Piston back down the exhaust from this engine would just be nitrogen which is what 78% of the atmosphere is already made from so it would be completely clean but if this is possible then why don't we use liquid nitrogen to rent our cars well in order to make the liquid nitrogen we have to condense nitrogen from the air this takes power and energy if you look at how much energy it takes to make liquid nitrogen versus how much energy you could get back out of it you'll find that you use more energy Mak the liquid nitrogen then you get back out of it in the engine this is because liquid nitrogen isn't an energy source but just a method to transfer stored energy with the original Heroes engine the heat is the true energy source not the evaporating water that gives us these extreme speeds but if we can get these crazy speeds and power from Hero's engine Why didn't it revolutionize the world when hero invented it thousands of years ago well one big reason is fuel efficiency herro's engine uses a lot of fuel to create a little bit of motion the technology to harness steam effectively just didn't exist yet it wasn't until the 1700s that inventors like Thomas nukan and James Watt figured out how to harness steam power to do useful work these machines later fueled the Industrial Revolution in fact over 80% of the world's electricity is still generated by spinning turbines often using steam like this for example this steam turbine works by directing high-speed steam over blades to to produce continuous rotational Force it's basically Hero's engine but refined and way more powerful Hero's engine was one of those ideas that seemed like just another curiosity at the time but sometimes curiosity is exactly what we need it opens the door to new discoveries and even though it didn't change the world back then Hero's engine has had a huge impact on science and engineering today and it all started with a little steam and a clever idea and by the way while researching this video I found that the backyard scientist used liquid propane to do the same thing and spin a ping pong ball over 9 years ago and he got to really high RPMs using that method as well and thanks for watching another episode of the action lab and we'll see you next time"

even massive tanks need protection after all anti-tank Munitions are only getting better each day the trophy is the only active protection system that has been saving lives in real Combat situations for years it has been employed on armored vehicles like The marava neyar Leopard 2 Challenger 3 and Abrams without hindering the crew's ability to engage targets the trophy creates an invisible field around the vehicle detecting and neutralizing threats from recoiless rifles atgms at Rockets heat tank rounds and RPGs it does this by launching explosively formed penetrat or efps directly at the incoming projectiles the energy debris and blast pressure destroy these threats at a safe distance from the tank however it does come with a downside the high-speed debris scattering in all directions can be dangerous for infantry and civilians if Optimus Prime decided to transform into a tank that would definitely describe the cv90 sting just look at its robotic arm designed to investigate and intervene with IEDs and roadside bombs plus this armored vehicle can be equipped with either a front mine plow or a roller system to chew through Enemy Mine Fields during operation The cv90 Sting is protected by the kongsberg remote Weapon Station RWS on its top Red Alert 2 fans will certainly like this design feature are you a fan of General towns and his laser Weaponry from Command and Conquer well that you'll definitely like this dragon fire able to hit a one PB coin from a kilometer away speaking of money one shot from this futuristic gun costs only 10 lb that's way cheaper than launching modern missiles worth thousands of dollars dragon fire is the first air defense system that uses lasers to engage targets at the speed of light their power is more than 50 KW that's just enough to power up your home and yet more energy is needed to blow up alderon for now do you remember those powerful energy Shields that protect spaceships and Star Trek well now anyone can deploy a similar technology on the battlefield leonitis will protect you from uavs by destroying their systems with powerful beams of energy just like your microwave popping popcorn the official release of this wonderful technology is expected in 2027 so the future is near but if you don't want to wait wait so long take this portable UAV neutralizer it looks like Master Chief's favorite gun from Halo but unfortunately it doesn't shoot bullets but Lance 2.0 can easily cut off the UAV signal from the GPS and operator bringing it safely to the ground the gun can work up to 4 hours in standby mode and its maximum range is 0.62 Miles however it requires a break after 120 seconds of usage and it weighs 20 2 lb so you'd have to be strong as Spartans to carry Lance 2.0 everywhere with you luckily if you opt for more classic guns this quad minigun is your ideal Choice it features four m134 mounted on a World War II era Max an M45 quadruple machine gun mount delivering 12,000 rounds per minute huh hey Sammy you definitely need this toy to stop the hordes of monsters each minigun is linked to a map that holds 3,000 rounds during the last test this turret shot 24,000 rounds in a couple of minutes making it a perfect weapon against infantry drones or for John Connor's safety what would happen if you United two Soviet Legends the t34 tank and the Mig 21 jet you'd get a weird child of love with an overall weight of 42 tons and two large turbines just like those fire trucks from the GTA games this this monster is used to fight the oil fires but unlike similar Vehicles it used 220 Gall of water per second blasting it out of the jet engines at the speed of sound obviously big wind could replace at least a dozen water benders from Avatar the Last air bender considering its maximum thrust of up to 71,000 kg per second it can consume water only from inner sources huh it looks like we finally found a way to see the bottom of Loch Lake don't you just hate those players flying around the map on helicopters or jets and killing everyone on the battlefield well luckily you can always bring them down to earth with the RB S70 NG this is an Innovative portable air defense gun with unjam laser guidance and autot tracking technology it takes less than 45 seconds to deploy this baby and shoot a Target within 5.59 Mi the reloading takes less than 5 seconds and highresolution thermal imaging ensures that the enemy won't hide from you in the Shadows of the Night moreover each rocket is designed with cameras that guarantee more accurate shooting and record videos for educational purposes only of course artillery is the god of war and even Kratos could do nothing against this PCL 18 181 this is a 155 mm self-propelled Howitzer compatible with all of of NATO's projectiles as well as the Chinese gp1 or GP 155 further it can shoot nuclear artillery shells after some minor modifications the fans of generals Zero Hour know what a couple of these vehicles can do to an entire military base in real life the maximum range of PCL 181 is 32.93 MI for active reactive planning projectiles in addition the ballistic calculations are significantly simil simplified by GPS a Laser Rangefinder and special computers the guys from the Ghost Recon Squad have a lot of innovative military gadgets but even they would be envious of Rogue one owners unlike the majority of military drones this model can immediately stop and attack and recover due to a fusing system with a mechanical interrupt Rogue one boasts jaw-dropping capabilities including 70 mph maximum speed 30-minute endurance and a range Beyond 6.21 Mi depending on its Target the Drone can carry a forward fragmentation Warhead or an explosively formed penetrator Warhead plus its operator can adjust the engagement angle and use autonomous tracking to ensure Rogue one will accurately hit its Target Predator would have never killed Arnold Squad in the Predator movie if they had worn these night walker suits this static and dynamic thermal concealment can can hide you from a thermal vision system for up to 2,952 Ft you can easily pack this suit from crisis inside a 7.87 X 5.9x 5.9 in compression bag it's fully breathable and perfect for high intensity activities so you won't get sweaty while fighting enemies and even if you want to wear it during the battle with the white walkers the suit will keep you warm even at 26.6 De F but if you want want to feel like a stealth God from cyberpunk 2077 you definitely need quantum stealth for only $50 you can get a piece of material that can make you or any object literally invisible quantum stealth uses secret material that ensures a 90% reduction of Shadows and uses light bending to hide anything behind it this amazing technology is as thin as paper making it a perfect solution to all modern camouflage issues just imagine the possibility of hiding from human eyes just like Harry Potter in any season at any time day or night by the way what would you do with this technology military logistics and rescue operations play a crucial role in any conflict luckily Zea Arrow can solve the majority of transportation problems due to its amazing features this Flying Saucer can reach a maximum speed of 160 mph while carrying up to 200 120 lb of cargo although its maximum range is currently less than 50 m on a single charge the company is working on improvements moreover Zeo wants to turn this useful vehicle into flying taxis by 2025 but make sure you won't pick up a redheaded girl if you don't want to get into big trouble the company plans to set the price at $140,000 per unit but at least you can save money on a driver because Zea Arrow can be flown by remote control control look what the developers of devtac made after watching Boba Fett's TV series inspired by this character they create a unique helmet able to withstand the 12.7 mm gunshots it's designed with detachable ballistic plates two an z87.1 lenses and an active ventilation system powered by two batteries devtac ensures 100% field of vision and up to 6 hours of work while powering night vision systems and action cameras further its built-in West United picol Linker screen can be connected to a mobile phone GPS or drone so you can definitely feel like Judge Dread the enemy can't shoot what it can't see this was The Guiding philosophy behind the creation of Sweden's unique adaptive camouflage system for armored vehicles it allows heavy equipment to blend into its surroundings becoming invisible to hostile thermal imaging systems it can can even make a tank look like other objects such as a car bushes or rocks how you ask well the Adaptive camouflage system uses honeycomb shaped modules that cover the vehicle's flanks these in turn can be individually controlled to create various visual patterns adaptive may even be used on Naval and aerial vehicles in the future turning helicopters into clouds or warships into waves can you imagine that Don't Panic that's not the aliens from the arrival movie but still this vbat drone can compete with even those spaceships it can fly up to 10 hours without charging and operate in any weather conditions the Drone can also take off or land even on moving vessels with a landing Zone as small as 12 in x 12 in it easily fits in the bed of an ordinary pickup and it takes only 20 minutes and a two-person team to prepare the vbat for deployment that's even easier than putting up a tent with your best buddy this drone is perfect for spotting enemies due to its EO cameras air and land wide area search systems and Powerful AI it can also deliver up to 25 lb of supplies to the toughest places on the battlefield you'd never guessed that this nice 6x6 truck can immediately turn into a system capable of launching 48 fixed Wing suicide uavs well unless you watched the Angel's Fallen movie the cait system may be installed not only on light military vehicles but also on ships helicopters and even in your backyard in a couple of minutes it can release the swarm of drones with 60-minute endurance and a 9.32m control radius finally there's a way to feel like Sarah carrian controlling zergs from Starcraft in addition to powerful strikes these tiny robots can perform non-kinetic attacks act as decoys or carry small [Music] packages that's not an ordinary Toyota Land Cruiser but the fastest mortar system in the world in only 2 minutes scorpion can be deployed fire up to eight rounds and retree no doubt it should be unofficially titled Flash the system is interchangeable which means it can fire both 81 mm and 120 mm projectiles while eliminating The Recoil on a vehicle the maximum range of the mortar is 4.97 MI and the fully digital Fire Control System reduces the time necessary to calculate the shot up to 5 Seconds plus you can expand the possibilities of this Innovative mortar by installing it on a helicopter or any other suitable aircraft can you imagine an armored tank providing a 360° of view during any weather conditions or time of day well now you can with this iron vision technology just like a VR helmet it allows the operator to collect the information from different digital sources within and around the vehicle it's even possible to notice an enemy crawling several meters near the tank yeah finally any real life camper won't go unnoticed thanks to this awesome device old school Counterstrike players remember the shields that make them almost impenetrable to enemy bullets but even they had some weak points fortunately valve didn't totally ruined the game play by adding to their game this foldable 12 layer bulletproof Kevlar Shield it protects law enforcement operatives from powerful gunfire and unlike the standard Shields which weigh 100 lb this protection weighs only 55 lb ensuring better Mobility constructing a bridge is an incredibly complex process the players of the build a bridge game know what we mean luckily leuan may become your real life cheat code that deploys 1 79 ft Bridge or up to 2 46t bridges in only 5 minutes this construction can withstand loads of up to 72 tons so even heavy ab's tanks can pass across the river over lean's improvised bridge and if necessary it can be transformed into a floating Bridge or Ferry significantly simplifying the logistics of moving armed vehicles but if you believe that leguan isn't enough to transport your army across the river the M3 amphibious rig is At Your Service this self-propelled bridging vehicle withstands more than 60 tons of weight so even the transferring of heavy leopard 286 or Challenger 2 won't be a problem just like bumblebee it transforms into a ferry with large 13 M aluminum pontoons while its crew Maneuvers it using controls located on the top of the hull every Soldier dreams of getting Captain America's superpowers but before we invent a super soldier serum this High Mobility powered exoskeleton is the only way it nullifies the weight of 66 lb and increases running speed to 8.38 mph the operator can control the speed and power of the suit via a tablet meanwhile the four batteries on its back ensure up to 2 hours of normal operation in tumultuous Urban settings like Gotham City military and police crime fighting units are indispensable and the mv3 hisy a special vehicle with frontal ballistic protection for up to eight people is crucial for these units equipped with infrared and thermal imaging cameras for situational monitoring gas and poison detectors and other technical gadgets the mv3 is nothing if not versatile it's effective both day and night even in low visib ility conditions the histrix is also robust and fast capable of moving at 5 mph on crowded or rius streets and thanks to its retractable battering ram and Harpoon obstacles are no problem navigation is essential for successful military operations but regular distractions on GPS or a map can significantly lower your attention thus you'll need this navboard flip mod a compact military accessory for hands-free navigation and Gadget organization considering its smart design the nav board flip mod is even more useful than a mini map from Arma 3 the m150 ABV mine clearing tank is a remarkable vehicle but sappers that is military engineers are still critically vital in this regard to protect their lower limbs these brave Soldiers now have anti-mine boots for instance the UK's PPE 100 can withstand the detonation of 2.6 o of TNT and anti-personnel mines These Boots come with Ballistic Gators that prevent Burns and reduce shrapnel injuries to The Shins in Ukraine the simple yet effective spider boots are currently in production and are an exact copy of their Canadian counterparts These Boots can withstand up to 3 1/2 o of explosive ordinance their composite design minimizes the impact of explosions and trapnel on the feet and legs the spider boots have successfully passed tests against Blu 43b and anti-personnel mines it looks like these limb-saving boots are going to stay in fashion for quite a while seeing as how over 50 countries around the world have mine ridden zones you've probably seen strategically important sites protected by sandbags before well laying those sandbags can be quite labor intensive but to make the task easier Pesco has created the mil foldable blocks for example to build a 10 m wall using mil it takes only two people one front loading machine and 20 minutes for comparison without mil that would normally require eight people 8 hours and hundreds of conventional bags not to mention three times the dirt to fill them these blocks look like gigantic fabric organizers but they're actually made of reinforced steel with a zinc aluminum coating making them highly resistant to artillery attacks and explosions what's more a spiral fastening system allows the containers to be detached like pages of a notebook making the Hesco M versatile not just for direct protection from head-on but for any other layout as well when there's no margin for error you have to have a wellth thought out plan now the Camaro xaver tactical visual visualization and tracking system is here to help Rescuers and military personnel do just that with x-ray vision powers like those of Superman these scanners can see through walls from over 100 m away wireless remote monitoring allows for critical threat assessment so more lives can be saved the display shows the precise location of people within a building as it measures the distance from the scanner to the Target indicates who is moving and determines their Rel ative position it makes you wonder if there are any superpowers left that are out of the reach of science that's all for now which of these Technologies

ultimate design this phone is so exclusive that these are going for about $9,000 on eBay right now the hilarious part is they don't even make accessories for it no cases no skins no nothing because it's China exclusive and I'm pretty sure they don't let DeBrands SK into China anymore after all this they've pulled over the years so we've got that in common anyway without further Ado massive shout out dbrand for getting this phone over to us however the hell it is you did that unlike a lot of our recent phone videos there's no Labs testing or anything it arrived we jumped through a bunch of freaking ridiculous Hoops to set up a Huawei cloud account and I jumped on set I am so excited to see this thing you will pay for this that's my garage door why is my garage door open that's a really weird anded up thing to have in the packaging is this from dbrand yes wow it's freaking huge I have looked at basically no media coverage of this thing because I wanted to experience it in person it's got about the same crease as I would have expected on like a first generation folding device but what jumps out to me is the astonishing thinness I'm daily driving an iPhone 16 plus right now this is the thickness of the iPhone in comparison it's on a whole other level I am loving the design too Huawei has gone from being just like a copycat brand to this looking absolutely incredible dude it's basically as thin as it could possibly be and still have a SIM tray I've seen concept devices for like a trifold for example on the Samsung booth at CES the difference is that even their concept devices weren't this thin that is not an IR emitter shut up it has an IR emitter this is a device that I look at and I go yeah they couldn't have fit a headphone jack in here not this one on the right volume rocker what appears to be a fingerprint sensing lock button USBC Port look at this can you even see the edges of it how is there room in this thickness at the edge of this port for the entire display stack is this leather it can't be can't be real leather it's got to be a faux leather but it feels really good oh oh it's folded oh dang that is so cool oh buddy in there yeah that's cool it's like a folded metal oh oh oh what what else is in the Box oh important reminder thank you Andy right I forgot Andy's my cameraman today oh this this Buddy ain't waterproof I'll tell you that much don't go where it's cold don't touch it with anything sharp don't touch it at all don't fold it if it's under 5° oh - 5 I can see why they didn't bring it to the Canadian Market this is the kind of thing that feels like they built a concept car and then they were just like you know what it we'll make a handful of them you know like it reminds me of that uh that Sony OLED from 2008 they were just like yeah this thing makes absolutely no sense at this price and size we're going to do it anyway oh it comes with Huawei earphones now I know that these are a thing that's good shut up 88 watt charging on this thing there's no way yeah okay this is an 8 Watt wait why does it come with comes with a car charger does it come with a reg oh dude this thing is the whole package regular charger 66 WS two cables oh it comes with a case that's great this carbon fiber oh my God I think this is real carbon fiber the reason I think it's real is a it looks real and B they know there isn't going to be a single accessory on the market for this so whatever comes in the box that's the only possible case that body can get for it which means if you have the kind of money to afford a phone like this it better be a good one how much does this cost in China it's not even that much like to be clear $2,800 is a freaking ton for a phone but you'd spend almost that much on a top tier iPhone especially if you pay for Apple Care which this includes similar service too it includes four Replacements of the screen protector in the first two years and a full out broken screen so it's not beyond the realm of what people are spending on phones it's just that uh that's for 16 gigs of RAM and only 256 gigs of storage I don't even know how they put a n chip in here let alone 250 you can get it with up to a terabyte of storage but that's going to cost you $3,400 $1.2 in display absolute freaking game changer for on the-go entertainment 3K resolution 92% screen to body ratio I believe it look how tiny these bezels are it's like a Samsung Galaxy fold plus a third phone this thing's crazy like pretty good anti- glare treatment it's not perfect but like guys that that's a studio light you know oh that's cool it prompts you for the password down in the bottom right cuz it knows how you're going to be holding it oh you can tell it if you're right or left-handed or if you're holding it shut up shut up Andy said if you're holding it with your left hand no way oh they did the work man I've been using a fed since the first generation Samsung Galaxy fooled okay and with those early ones you could really tell like it was basically stock Android but like with some tablet tweaks and you know they didn't really have it all figured out dude it moves where the pin prompt is depending where you swipe that is freaking awesome it's little touches like that that make all the difference in the world with a device like this it comes pre-loaded with a lot of garbage that I know is pretty typical for Chinese devices we've talked about three screens two okay how does it feel in the s that is smooth the way it transitions you guys also this is totally a high refresh rate display what are the compromises people 90 htz which is good enough obviously 120 144 is better or whatever you're extreme gamer but if you're an extreme gamer you're not buying this phone now that I finally got it folded down the whole way dude it's not even thicker than a bfold from Samsung and it's a trifold wow yeah it's thicker than a traditional candy bar phone but it's not totally unreasonable either like again as someone who used a fold for a long time it feels pretty good in the hand and not only that but this is such a usable form factor man do you remember how small the front screen was on the first Galaxy fold like it's tiny I made that work this would be basically no compromise is no no I would go like this boom fold boom I got some movies to watch I want this thing so bad like so bad does it even work on Canadian bands come on wuwei it's not like we jailed your executive and kicked all your infrastructure out of our country or anything I'm going to try it I'm putting my Sim in it boys you can uninstall their garbage I can uninstall WWE wallet maybe blah blah blah yeah sure see you later okay cool so I don't have to keep any of that stuff in single window view you could swipe up and down to either side to scroll oh that's a nice usability tweak dude this is crazy it's so thin it's so light let's talk about specs we got a Kiren 9010 7 NM chip in here 10.2 7.9 or 6.4 in display no particular Peak brightness rating though uh hey you got the Play Store and everything wait what the hell is an aurora store no Google Play services you can't even force it dang it so wait what am I how am I what am I supposed to watch on here then we did find one source that says 1,500 nits we found another source that said 1,000 nits either way it's pretty flipping bright this is not like your first generation folding displays where they're super dim and basically unusable outside looks a little yellow it's got a bit of a red cast compared to the iPhone but in terms of the brightness and SDR content I do not see any disadvantage here I will say this though the color accuracy is probably good enough for just about anybody who's not doing color critical work on their phone and can your iPhone do this holy crap no your iPhone can't do that it looks like even when they're powering the whole display the overall brightness is close it might be a little bit less bright oh man the auto rotate it's like it's off like it's 90° off oh it doesn't know what mode I'm in oh that's uh H that's a that's a downer and a half you could see it's working fine in byold mode but then I switch over to trifold herp herp perp the lock button like right there you're going to accidentally Mash that constantly but this is like caveman technology by comparison this is awesome you got to put all your apps in like a little like shuffly thing like a peasant d don't you even have a bigger screen Apple oh oh I want to try the camera though it has a variable aperture camera how the crap did they pull that off oh oh no way you can go all the way from f1.4 to F4 basically that affects how wide the hole is through which the camera is shooting which affects the depth of field and affects how much light gets in so if I want to open it up all the way I can get real bokeh like not fake AI bokeh like real B on my shot that is super cool I can close it all the way and I can make sure that basically everything in my shot is in Focus okay let's go back to let's go back to auto mode though not the best I've seen not terrible pretty sharp actually 50 megapixels yeah you can count every one of them you can actually read the brand of our tripod on the Huawei can barely make it out on the iPhone pretty wild hey man look at that look at it like stretch out more that is so cool dude I want one of these so bad wow that's some big sound boys one speaker here one speaker here they're pretty muddy but given the space constraints I'm still very impressed I'm also impressed by how little the folds are bothering me once I've actually got content on the screen you can see as I move it around and catch the light you'll catch a glimpse of them once in a while especially when it's directly reflected towards your eyes but overall pretty good at most of the angles that you would actually care about even though it does have an older processor in it they've got a 5600 mAh battery in here that'll help a lot you'll probably get a day out of it all right let's put on the case this little flappy guard thing kind of gets in the way when you go from Bold to trifold but apparently it's there cuz people were concerned about the unprotected screen here and like this way it it's right there when you're holding it so I guess that's something oh yeah I was going to try out the stand oh yeah that could work there we go okay oh yeah oh yeah okay she's stable she's stable she's stabilized oh yeah there we go no problem bud I mean look you laugh laugh all you want but this was an engineering challenge that someone at wuwei had to solve and they did a pretty pretty okay job oh not bad not bad nope a little inconsistent oh ah it'll be better without the case I think so much better nope it failed I think it comes down to when I enrolled it it was kind of wonky because I had the case on I would definitely recommend enrolling with the case not on I want one so bad but there are multiple deal breakers here even if it did support North American bands which it may VAR well there's no Google services on here which doesn't mean oh yeah well just go get the Play Store and add Google surface no they won't run on it not unless you like I don't know rooe it somehow but then you're going to lose a lot of the optimizations that Huawei has made to Harmony OS you literally cannot put the Play Store on here and you can't run Google apps like Google Maps for example wait Google Maps works ah I see the rotation bug pretty brutal and even though we have it set to English right now there are many aspects of the device that remain Chinese only there's no IP rating so you drop this thing in the drink it is dead and setting up an account in Canada was extremely difficult because Huawei devices are aband in the country over security concerns finally the S SOC and Camera are well actually I thought the camera seemed pretty solid but the so is very last gen estimated to be about on par with a Snapdragon 888 which came out in 2020 I really want one though and I want you to subscribe to Short Circuit thanks again to dbrand for making it possible for us to get our hands on this thing I uh was not expecting it to blow my mind this effectively you can go check out debrand products for other devices maybe their cases or skins or uh accessories for your PlayStation console you can check them out atl.com is that the vanity URL these days Yeah ironic that it's called a vanity URL"

and then follow it up with the nothing ear and then nothing ear EG yeah maybe I was wrong everybody makes [Music] mistakes the biggest problem that this caused is when people are searching online to buy the product they can't find the right product which hurts our business so that's the main thinking behind maybe that this was not the right choice more than just a theme on your desktop there's kind of similar to uh Carl pay's previous employer OnePlus I mean I don't know why it coughed it's not necessarily inspiration from OnePlus it's just that we have a lot of the people who built oxygen working on nothing OS so there was no specific thing to look at what they did and copy it's just what we felt was good and I think this is a really good opportunity now that this company has had three whole phone releases to decide is what they're doing actually achieving their goal can using phone improve your life make you a more present person or are these really just basic phones but with batty designs for people who are happy to sacrifice value to be different I think to answer this question we need to take a step back in our minds we need to have a a map almost of how doing this will lead to that then doing that will eventually get us closer to the goal everybody else in the smartphone space is operating at 100 million devices a year we cross the 1 million year mark this year but we're still like 50 to 100 times smaller than everybody else so when it comes to delivering Val value we have to pay way more for our components and that hinders us to grow this is the problem that we have to solve first we have to grow into one of the biggest smartphone companies in the world before we can more aggressively pursue this other Vision on nothing go as 2.6 though the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth boxes grow bigger for no reason at all and take onethird of the screen and there are only six more settings available to you with every swipe and where is brightness Oh I thought that was a slider or divider or something nobody should have to press on something to figure out what they are this one we agree with and we've uh addressed it in three .0 but it was completely unrelated to this video uh I think the main thing for Quick Settings is that we have a good information density meaning that if you wipe on one screen you can have enough things to do there versus the two big boxes taking up a lot of space and not being very functional but this was a good opportunity for me to see how convenient monochromatic icons are when it comes to actually using them you might think monochromatic icons make it easier to navigate cuz they're consistent but they're not our goal with it is to make your smartphone experience more intentional you go to the apps you're really looking for instead of by accident automatically going to social media so you unlock your phone you want to do something but oh there's this blue Facebook icon let me just click it and see what's new we wanted to avoid that if we missed something from a functional perspective and it's important to the users we should listen to that more if it's Aesthetics feedback I think we should consider that less because I think we already have one of the best design teams in the world when it comes to these type of products could we learn could we get better yes maybe sure but usually the people giving feedback on Aesthetics are not as strong as the folks we have internally so so it doesn't mean that they're not going to have good things to say but it just means that the bar is a lot higher and we need to filter a lot more strictly when it comes to that kind of feedback cable is oh transparent USBC cool man I'll give it to you Carl this is nice the exterior box is all right the interior box is really nice I'm going to do that a 9 on 10 dude it's okay I would have given this eight on the charger in the Box I think we learned something here so our rationale was hey it's already 2024 and a lot of people have smartphones and they already have Chargers um so why do we have to put in the box and increase the price of the overall product versus just you know people can use whatever they have already if you look at our users we have some really young users maybe it is one of their first smartphones and they don't have the charger already I think the best solution is not to bundle it in the box but to have it as a soft bundle meaning like when you buy it you can also choose to buy the charger at a reduced price um I think that's the best of both worlds so I've been using the cmf phone one for the better part of about a week now and to be honest it feels just like I'm using a nothing phone which is a compliment matter of fact it's literally running nothing OS 2.6 and aside from the lightup glyph interface it's not missing a single feature that the more premium nothing phones actually have even if it's a more budget focused product it still has to be the best product within that price range meaning if you take the cmf phone1 and other potential products that people who buy the cmf phone1 would be considering we still have to be really proud about our offering compared to the others no matter what product we put out there we want to invest the outmost care and love to try and make it as good as possible I do really wish sense you can take the back off I wish they let you swap out the battery what number com saying that would have been a huge opportunity for them I wonder why they didn't do that these lithium batteries they're great but if there's a slight dent in them they will explode so if you're going to make a removable battery there needs to be so much reinforcement material around it which limits the amount of space you can have for the real battery so either your phone gets thicker heavier or your battery capacity is less but soon EU will force everybody to do it so you know we'll see what happens then today I'm to with a foam that's also a comb and a Lego base plate and an ice cream sandwich it's also a fully functioning Dart Blaster yes some of these are really cool and a Pik atini rail platform and a secret credit card holder I like the Nerf gun I think that will be useful in the office I'll probably print this one out actually pretty cool it's like the phones of the olden days right yeah I'm not sure what's this slicer I don't know why anybody would need this but it looks interesting I think these are really fun and cool but would be great if it could be a bit more practical I don't really know what to do with this speaking of cmf phone 1 we're giving away 10 to 10 lucky subscribers to enter make sure you're subscribed and drop a comment below if you missed the last giveaway make sure you hit the Bell so you know when the next giveaway drops back to car if you look at the SIM card tray you can see the little minimalist dot theme that makes up the rest of the UI nothing's attention to detail is seriously unmatched plus this battery has the same dotted branding that we see all over the UI and the SIM card tray nothing is consistent and by nothing I mean everything nothing does is consistent both inside and out I don't think anybody has asked the team to do this but because we're building a very special type of company and the people who join us are very excited about building great products cool stuff like this just happens like the Pokémon example from a year and a half ago I didn't know that that was a plan but it was like a pleasant surprise using this phone has made me feel like we might be starting to reach the limit of what you can do with LEDs there's a lot of debates about the usefulness of the glyph interface some people like it some people say it's not useful I still think we haven't completely solve the problem where the users seem to be the product for a smartphone rather than the product being the product you know GPH interface is one way we're going to solve this but there's also other stuff we cing up yeah it's fair necessary but a bit cringe it takes time to develop something so when it's developed we launch it and that's why it's staggered but I've actually seen 2A buyers be happy about the 2A plus because they think the 2A is a better value I've also seen 2A plus users believe it the 2A plus is a better value so I think that's kind of the sweet spot right where nobody is unhappy people who say that they're unhappy on the comment are basically bystanders meaning they're just kind of flaming without being customers so that's also fine and we should you know ignore those people I think you know because I was one of those people who flamed people online when I was younger on forums so I know my type it's pretty funny I like the meme um it's a little bit old what it's saying is not true because there's a lot of people about the phone one who are super happy with nothing OS and the support we were giving them it's just a very small portion of people who believe this is fact but it's not the reality you know I would personally love a smart phone like a 6.3 or 6.2 but once we get much bigger as a company then we can consider other form factors because today if we made a small phone it's not going to sell enough to be profitable let's just make it bigger and then we'll see what happens I think this is a very fair question this person should have a little bit of patience to see what we actually are planning to build and launch before deciding whether they're in or out yeah I mean technology has set up a lot of artificial barriers between us and other people and the things we want to do you know one example in the nothing os3 video that we released recently was we have this concept of passive social on through our widgets I might have a great friend we have each other's pedometers so I can see how many steps he or she is walking and we can compete against each other um that experience makes us feel closer to the people around us at its core technology has to serve humans and not the other way around that's what we firmly believe in but we need some time before we can ship this out and you can see phones are just just boring and it's not about this phone or this phone iPhones are boring Samsung phones are boring do I need to mention any other brand no because there's no place for any other brand on the market these are the top 10 bestselling smartphones in the world in 2022 eight iPhones two Samsung phones that's it right now we're in the smartphone cycle and smartphones are not very different from each other but if you think about two adjacent Cycles the feature phone cycle and the smartphone cycle then the product are very different right so you could have said the same thing during Nokia and blackberries hey day oh it's so boring nobody cares there's only Nokia and blackberry and then everything changed then you can imagine a future where everything changes again very quickly I have fun I think we should do it more often maybe when phone 3 comes out yeah let's do and that comes out when

categories of china-made goods dominating in the global Marketplace and it is causing discomfort China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity the overc capacity debate has sparked intense [Music] discussion our capacity Europe is also increasingly worried about the future of its high-tech Industries when byd is starting to sell more cars than BMW that is going to pose problems for China and German relations take the electric vehicle sector it is a crucial industry for the clean economy with a huge potential in Europe but Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars as Beijing tries to export its way out of an economic slowdown what impact would it have on the rest of the world let me tell you something to China if you're listening presiden she those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now and you think you're going to get that you're going to not hire Americans and you're going to sell the cars to us now now if I don't get elected it's going to be a blood bath for the country globally green capacity is not excessive but in D scarcity the problem now is not over capacity but over anxiety and just how did China develop such a formidable Competitive Edge in the three clean tech industries of Eves solar panels and lithium ion batteries [Music] [Music] on the 9th of April 2024 Steel Workers protested outside Chile's presidential Palace to demand higher terorists on Chinese steel Imports according to data from the the Latin American Steel Association in 2023 the region imported a record 10 million tons of Chinese steel a 44% rise from the year before Chinese steel is almost 40% cheaper than what's made locally in 2024 Chile's biggest Steel company announced it is shutting [Music] down data from the World Bank shows China is the top exporter of Steel when measured by quantity Chile Mexico South Africa and Saudi Arabia have all taken action against China Steel exports over in the United States Steel has also become an election issue Chinese steel companies produce a lot more steel than China needs it ends up dumping extra Steel on the global market markets and unfairly low prices and the prices are unfairly low because China's steel companies don't need to worry about making a profit because the Chinese Governor subsidized them so heavily they're not competing they're cheating they're cheating and we've seen the damage here in America [Music] concluding her visit to China in April 2024 US Secretary of Treasury Janet y delivered these remarks China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity actions taken by the PRC today can shift World prices and when the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question according to yelen China makes more solar panels batteries and EVS than its domestic Market can absorb it reflects Chinese policies that place great priority on these sectors Channel support to them enable them to continue operating even when prices drop to very low levels due to overc capacity and their firms don't exit um the market instead it's potentially our firms that have to do so one day later China refutes these claims one week later during a visit to China German Chancellor Olaf Schultz pressed his case for open and fair markets warning his hosts against dumping and overproduction this while also urging the European Union to avoid acting out of protectionist self-interest when when byd is starting to sell more cars than BMW that is going to pose problems for China and German relations we are committ at the end of April blinkin again raised the issue solar panels uh electric vehicles and the batteries that power them China alone is producing more than 100% of global demand for these products flooding markets undermining competition putting at risk livelihoods and businesses around the world in early may it was French president macron raising the same issue during President C's visit to France in response president C says overcapacity does not exist before going any further it's important to recall a basic economic principle the principle of comparative advantage which says when country a can make Goods cheaper because of reason like lowcost operations for example that's their advantage and they should sell it to the world country B should find their own comparative advantage in Goods they can make better and then they should trade that's been the key principle guiding global trade for the last 200 years ever since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 its share of global exports has been increasing as this data set from the United Nations shows China's share of the global export of goods have been climbing exponentially the last two decades making it the world's Undisputed export Champion around the same time the United States lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in part due to the growing trade deficit in manufactured goods with China Japan me Mexico and other countries the US trade deficit with China was the largest Let's uh talk about um the first China shock now the number here is that 5 million us manufacturing jobs were lost and the hollowing out of manufacturing has been linked to all kinds of problems right poverty drug use depression but can you break down these numbers for us how much of it is due to factories Outsourcing to China and how much of this is due to techn iCal factors like automation for example what's really happened is that the China Factor has accelerated a long running trend of decreased manufacturing employment in the us if we go back to the 1950s 30% of the US Workforce was in manufacturing in the early 2000s before China joined the WTO that had already halved to 15% so you can see these long running trends of Technology automation digitization reducing man manufacturing employment and then China joins as well and accelerates this whole process so you get a much faster uh loss of manufacturing jobs after China joined the WTO in 2001 and that shrinks to around 9% of total us employment about 5 million jobs lost I think what the China shock did is really accelerated a process that maybe would have taken 20 years normally actually took place in around 10 years for some economists refer to that first round of manufacturing job losses as the first China shock when toys textiles glass and all sorts of other straightforward manufacturing processes move moveed to China what us and some European leaders are concerned about is the beginning of a second China shock and this time it's not going to be in Goods like these the second China shock could be even larger than the first and I think what we've got now in China is an unprecedented combination of four things the first is 30% share of global manufacturing the second is relatively cheap wages even now the third and this is key Advanced technological capacity and then the fourth massive consistent sustained State support for these sectors the combination of those four factors is unprecedented in history and with that I think we're going to get a second China trade shock this time at the advanced manufacturing um products and that's going to put a lot of pressure now onto Europe to Japan to South Korea and even again pressure onto the US this is a new shock that is just really beginning and is going to to Ripple through over the next four five 10 years [Music] naal interest for [Music] back in 2016 Trump ran an election campaign targeting China and won we can't continue to allow China to rape our country this time around Trump is doing the same let me tell you something to China if you're listening president she those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now and you think you're going to get that you're going to not hire Americans and you're going to sell the cars to us now we're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line and you're not going to be able to sell those guyss if I get elected now if I don't get elected it's going to be a blood bath for the whole that's going to be the least of it it's going to be a blood bath for the country that'll be the least of it today after the China issue also features on President Biden's election campaign instead of relying on equipment made overseas in places like China the supply chains will be again made in America they'll begin in America again in America in Europe similar concerns have arisen [Music] [Music] Chinese automaker byd has a lot to celebrate in 2023 it became the world's biggest electric vehicle or EV seller a title it claimed from us company Tesla those results forced Tesla to slash prices of its cars across the globe in first quarter 2024 Tesla emerged tops again but the competition between Tesla and byd continues to be intense [Music] you come to Auto Show and you see all of the traffic at the Chinese automakers booths I was at the Audi booth and one of my favorite beautiful car is the the rron the RS rron and it took me less than 10 seconds to wait for somebody and then I got in it myself then you go over to zeker and they have just launch of Zer X which is a small little car that I think is going to be less than 300,000 R&B or less than $40,000 in the China Market I waited 10 minutes for this little car because there were so many people that wanted to see it and so the management of these European automakers also saw this and then in disbelief they got into the vehicles themselves they closed the door they heard the sound you know that matches what they're traditionally able to do and then look at the technology on the on the in uh on the uh in instrument panel and the infotainment system and um Jaws were dropped I think there is a lot of disbelief a lot of shock uh but a bit of fear you know director level manager level now they touch feel see these cars and they're like wow um we are in trouble [Music] China's EV dreams stretches back to 1992 when prominent China scientist chenu asked the government to start work on EVS if you believe you can achieve the Chinese government played a pivotal role in developing the EV industry when assessing State support in China it's important to note that you could call China a mobilization state so when you have this objective of developing EVS or a made in China 2025 it's not as simple as just one-off subsidies it's a whole effort that the party state gets behind you have cheap lending partly funded by the pboc you have local governments providing land and utility deals uh the trade Ministry puts restri restrictions on on competitor uh products being imported into China and then even the retail investors they see a policy signal and they're going to pile into the into the equities of these companies and provide with cheap financing so it's really a whole system approach to uh developing and supporting these sectors is one that's consistently carried out for a number of years and in the specific case of EVS highlight a couple of policies that were really crucial number one cheap funding uh both for the uh firms themselves but also their prospective buyers the households purchasing these vehicles and the other one was was the tax rebates and the ease of of buying these vehicles particularly in the big cities where license plates are rationed quite scarce it is no secret that government subsidies were crucial to the growth of Chinese EV companies xun for example depended on a state-owned Enterprise near Guang Joo to lend it over 200 million in 2017 for the construction of its initial Factory then the city of Wuhan helped xong buy land and borrow money at low interest rates for a new plant there now xong is not only making EVS but also pushing out cars straight out of science fiction movies this is xun's electric flying car the vehicle will first be sold in China for more than 1 million Yu or $140,000 us the company says buyers should be able to fly the EV in designated trial areas in February 2021 China introduced the concept of a low altitude economy into its National planning economists concerned about a second China shock often point to the forces of state plan planning government subsidies and Company Innovation these flying EVS are a case in [Music] point governments elsewhere are pushing back take the electric vehicle sector it is a crucial industry for the clean economy with a huge potential in Europe but Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars and their price is kept artificially Low by huge State subsidies this is distorting our market so I can announce today that the commission is launching an anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles coming from China how you over capacity over capacity the Auto industry in Europe is a major employer and jobs are a major hot button issue when it comes to elections in Europe in February 2023 car maker Ford said it will ax 4,000 jobs in Europe in June 2023 Swedish car parts manufacturer autolive said it will cut 8,000 jobs the same month car maker stellantis announced it plan to close its plant in Austria after 40 years impacting 300 jobs in October Germany's Volkswagen cut 2,000 jobs in the following month French Tire maker Michelin said it will cease operations at three factories in Germany by end of 2025 affecting over 1,500 jobs the Auto industry is a huge part of the European economy its turnover is about seven times Europe's GDP of the European Union that is it employs directly and indirectly about 13 million people that's 6% of total EU employment and also psychologically it's it's a big part of the the history of Industrial Development within Europe so it's a massive part of the economy and they are qu quite rightly worried of of Chinese competition both within Europe and and globally on the 10th of April 24 the European commission put out a 700 page document outlining details of what they say are distortions in the Chinese market do you think that we will see a trade War emerge between Europe and China like what we've seen between China and the US I think trade friction is inevitable that is guaranteed we can see it happening already an outright trade War I think is less likely um mainly for two factors that the first is somewhat ideological Europe is is an open economy it has to trade to survive so it's less willing than the US which is almost self-sufficient in many cases to be isolationist so Europe needs to stay open it needs to trade the second factor is although pressure is coming from China it is still the largest market for many European companies for luxury goods for vehicles for Industrial Products these European companies rely on China for a lot of Revenue a lot of profits uh that are reinvested within Europe so that that dependency is there to a much greater extent than what we saw in in [Music] America for foree across rural China in even the most remote parts of the country solar panels could be seen to dot the landscape in China's cities solar panels are also spread across rooftops and they're even on building [Music] facades China installed a record 27 gaw of solar panels in 2023 that's more than than what the US has ever built in its entire history and more than in any other [Music] country for one of the key reasons why solar production and installation is so high in China is because the economy has been weak now Xi Jinping is trying to shift the economy away from the old growth model relying on property infrastructure high debt towards something a bit more advanced manufacturing new technology uh some more on the export side and so when covid hit and the property crash came over the past couple of years in China instead of pulling the old stimulus levers which were build roads build more houses China really went all out on these Advanced manufacturing sectors so lending and investment by those sectors up around 20% year-over-year for the past couple of years and a lot of that has come from the solar side and so because the economy is weak they're getting more subsidies more pressure to produce and that is driving installation over the last three decades industrial policy State subsidies Innovation intense competition and economies of scale have propelled Chinese solar companies to a level of global competitiveness that few others elsewhere can rival today China dominates the global solar sector in 2021 Chinese companies account for more than 80% of the Global Market at every stage of the manufacturing process according to the International Energy agency in the shadow of their success hundreds of solar companies in the US and Europe declared bankruptcy [Music] we have not forgotten how China's unfair Trade Practices affected our solar industry many young businesses were pushed out by heavily subsidized Chinese competitors pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcies promising talents when searching for Fortune abroad this is why fairness in the global economy is so important because it affects lives and livelihoods hi my name is Joe mourville I'm the president of energy independent Solutions we do a wide mix of anything solar price of Solar I mean when we started the business it was around $3 a off for a module and now you know a decent module you're getting at under 50 cents it's like a you know 1/8 the price or something the US was once a stronghold of solar module manufacturing accounting for around a quarter of global solar module shipments in the early 2000s but that started changing around 2010 we State American made up until maybe 2012 2014 uh when uh we could no longer buy the product anymore because at that point you know China had driven most of the companies into bankruptcy most of the US companies into bankruptcy at that point actually testified in the trade case in Washington for it China basically subsidizes at their production level so their product is coming off of the line before it goes into a container already carrying subsidy us solar manufacturers were going broke but the overall industry was growing fast people found employment selling and installing the China solar modules well couldn't compete head-to-head with China but it kind of improved the whole Market everybody started to really step up to the plate and then it started to the finances started to make sense you know it just started to steamroll from that point helped by Cheap Imports solar installations soared in the 2010s peaking in 2016 16 before Trump got elected and plunging after Trump slapped huge tariffs on China solar Imports no more tariffs on the sun Sol for everyone no more tariffs on the sun Sol for everyone no more tariffs on the China solar modules were slapped with a 30% tariff under Trump's trade War we're out here to fight against the solar tariffs that the Trump Administration has imposed we want make sure that those don't hurt American workers in this growing industry Sol is growing we don't want to stop the [Applause] [Music] growth the US and China they need to get politics out of the way and start looking at the good of the human race when President Biden was elected solar installations soared again the US continued to import solar panels but this time mainly from Southeast Asia where many Chinese solar companies set up new factories to avoid the tariffs the US has also been trying to rebuild its solar manufacturing industry factories that were shuttered from Chinese competition are reopening again they are doing so because of generous subsidies from the inflation reduction act which channels 430 billion us to clean energy Industries now the US is also trying to Build It Solar industry using subsidies from the immense inflation reduction act by subsidizing American Industries at this scale isn't the US doing exactly what China is doing yeah um it the us is going back to Industrial policy it's it's a little bit ironic considering they're criticizing China's model of doing things but they are moving back there and doing it themselves the big difference is that they've lost the capacity to do so industrial policy was you know heavily opposed in Washington for years and years and years trying to go back to do that is very difficult they've lost the knowhow or of carrying out big effective industrial policy programs yeah exactly on that point right could there be a risk of over subsidizing an industry that might not be competitive globally and may not be sustainable in the long run yes that I mean that certainly is is a real risk and to do industrial policy effectively it needs to have a clear goal picking the right sector and be sustained and sufficiently large enough over a long period of time to develop that that industrial competitiveness within a a domestic economy now the US can do that the Market's large enough they have the financial resources but the question is also around political willpower will if if a new president comes in will they continue with this industrial policy push globally green capacity is not excessive but in D scarcity the problem now is not over capacity but over anxiety calling for stronger climate response on one hand and erecting green trade barriers on the other would only raise the cost for one's own low carbon transition and also slow down the global development of clean energy we are committed to as blinkin raises the issue of overc capacity in the Solar industry China focuses on new markets for its clean tech exports its aim the global South fast growing populous energy-hungry parts of the world who are trying to transit to clean energy as soon as they can currently there are 745 million people in the world who still do not have access to electricity Europe and Asia were the largest export markets for China solar companies in 2023 with Europe forming 48% of all China solar exports and Asia making up 23% as debates continue around whether or not China's solar industry is facing overc capacity a new trade complaint is lodged this time in wind farms the EU is investigating China's involvement in Wind parks in Spain Greece France Romania and Bulgaria last year the EU imported some $ 1.42 billion US worth in turbines and components from China so the wind power industry is is an interesting one it's an area where the EU is still competitive and where there is quite a lot of advantages in terms of localized production so shipping those big turbine blades it's it's very difficult they are massive now they're getting bigger and bigger transporting them from say China to Europe is very costly very difficult so by the moving early the hope is that the EU will maintain this Competitive Edge it has within wind power production and I think that's the goal of these early stage in investigations electric vehicles solar panels and lithium ion batteries these are the three Industries in which China exports dominate the global market debates have erupted over whether or not China has over capacity in these three areas just how did China come to dominate the global battery industry the answer lies far outside China's borders here in Zimbabwe in Africa Chinese company J changuu Cobalt company broke ground on a new lithium m in July 2023 here at the opening ceremony is the president of Zimbabwe a sign of the importance of this investment Jiang Hau Cobalt company is a market leader in battery manufacturing and has been investing in mines across [Music] Africa over in South South America in the remote Salt Flats of Bolivia Chinese company catl announced in 2023 that it will invest more than a billion dollars here to produce lithium carbonate used in battery [Music] production over in Southeast Asia in Indonesia Chinese companies also dominate the supply chain Indonesia has the world's largest reserve of nickel and Ching Shan Holding Group the world's top nickel producer has been operating here in Indonesia for close to two decades long before nickel became a critical component in the making of batteries according to the iea China processes more than half of the world's lithium along with other crucial battery materials how did Chinese mining companies get such a foothold across different parts of the world [Music] made in Africa with China for the world fore [Music] back in China the battery supply chain is supported with careful State planning this is sweing in Sichuan a city with a population of about 2.8 million people and all the companies on the Main Street of sweing work on just one product lithium batteries here they make the cells the batteries and they even recycle the batteries all of this happened by government design the local government office selects the companies that complements the industrial chain they [Music] [Music] want those battery components made in sweing support the operations of catl the world's largest battery maker catl has a plant in neighboring City iben again a result of industrial [Music] policy the result of these coordinated efforts from mining overseas to carefully plann Supply chains is a battery production process that is unrivaled in the world China's battery makers have achieved unimagined able economies of scale in just over a decade today more than 3/4 of lithium ion batteries are made in China and mainly by just two firms catl and byd the US and Europe have both taken steps in recent years to build up their domestic battery Industries the price tag for self-reliance will not be cheap BNF data suggests that Europe and us would need to spend 98 billion and 82 billion respectively on growing a local battery [Music] industry whether in simple toys home wear party accessories or in high-tech Arena of batteries solar panels and electric vehicles China has managed to achieve comparative advantage in all these industries and more seeing in the context of his long history it is a moment of Reckoning [Music] [Applause] [Music] I think the second China trade shock is just beginning we've had a big change in perception of China trade driven by three major events Co Trump trade War Russia Ukraine so the perceptions have changed but we're only now starting to see the real economic effects in terms of investment decisions trade flows higher inflation routing of the global supply chain that's only just getting started and with that will come much more trade friction in the months ahead so really only the very beginning of the economic impact and the start of a new set of trade disputes [Music] [Music]"

having a computer is like walking. so you can   discover a lot but it takes forever. but then we 
invented computers and they're like cars. we can   get farther faster than we could before. and 
our computers kept getting better and better   so our cars kept getting faster and faster. but 
quantum computers aren't faster cars. think of   them instead like boats. a boat isn't better or

uhbDfi7Ee7k,Awnings: a simple cooling tech we apparently forgot about,Seriously - where'd they go? Links 'n' stuff: Technology Connections on Mastodon: https://mas.to/@TechConnectify Technology ...,Technology Connections,2024-07-15T14:55:02Z,28,[],PT22M15S,1622561,8399,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)'],True,"You ever reach way back into your brain and uncover something from the not-too-distant past
that seems weirdly obvious yet isn’t popular anymore? That’s right, I’m talking about window awnings! You used to see these everywhere, especially on those cute brick ranches
kitty corner to the house where you grew up - I’m sure that’s a universal experience. But lately, they’ve fallen out of fashion. And I would like to make the case that we should get them back. Quick programming note, I’m not gonna be 
recommending any specific kind of awning or product line or anything like that. I am not here to sell you anything ...YouTube ads notwithstanding... though I do like spreading ideas. And awnings are one of those ideas that our ancestors figured out
but as far as I can tell we just decided we’re too cool for these days. Which is ironic because window awnings keep you cool. That’s their point! Or at least, a central point. See, we like windows. [WIndows XP error sound]
Maybe not that kind, but that kind is pretty universally liked. They let in natural light and allow us to look outside and see things. But windows are also great big holes in walls
which we only plugged with thin sheets of glass. While they have gotten surprisingly good over the years
at keeping heat energy from moving through them, they’re still nowhere near as good as the thick walls which surround them. And, here’s the important bit to this video, they become a major source of heat gain when the sun shines through them. Ever heard of the greenhouse effect? That doesn’t just happen in greenhouses, it happens any time the sun’s energy makes it through a transparent window and into an enclosed space. Like your house. Once sunlight makes its way into your home, 
it lands on the stuff inside like flooring, furniture, et cetera. That stuff absorbs the sun’s light energy
which is then re-radiated into your home as heat energy. This heat gain from solar irradiance, in the context of buildings, is called insolation. Not insulation - but insolation. Don’t look at me, I just work here. Thanks to recent innovations in coatings on the glass,
a lot of this energy is reflected away and kept out of your home. But, fun fact, the sun is extremely powerful so even with really fancy windows
there’s a lot of energy getting inside that ultimately becomes heat. Don’t take my word for it, just ask a cat. In the winter months this warmth can be a pretty nice benefit, but in the summer months - it sucks. And our ancestors knew this. They figured out that if you designed a structure
so that the windows couldn’t be in direct sunlight, then there would be no greenhouse effect
and the interior of that structure would stay much cooler. Those grand covered porches you see on fancy old houses throughout much of the Southern US weren’t just for enjoying the breeze, they kept the windows entirely shaded. In fact they kept pretty much the entire structure shaded. And it wasn’t just plantation houses - the galleries attached to historic French Quarter buildings also help keep the buildings cool. Notice how the building is in direct sunlight here but almost the entire 
structure (other than the roof) is in shade. Of course, those examples have multiple purposes. I can’t earnestly say that shading windows was “the point” of a covered porch. It also created a pleasant outdoor space and protected windows and doors
from the elements, allowing you to leave them open in a rainstorm. But we did recognize the value of that coverage. So much so that in the not-too-distant past, there were popular products for your home which provided the shade and cover of an opulent wraparound porch but with minimal materials and easy installation. What products, you ask? Awnings! It appears these really came into vogue in the 1920’s. This 1927 article in Building Age and National Builder comes out swinging: “A Beautiful home which is devoid of awnings
resembles a well dressed man without a necktie. The awnings give that finishing touch,
just the last point to complete the proper taste.” Seems like the author really likes awnings! But why? It’s all about keeping comfortable! “An awning on the porch permits the use of the porch
when the hot afternoon sun is shining. They will keep the porch shady and pleasant,
and this also reduces the temperature of the rooms adjoining the porch.” And here’s my favorite part: “The fact that the awning excludes the sun from the window glass is quite an important asset in reducing the temperature of the room, and in preventing the fading of wall paper and carpet.” Sure seems like awnings are the cat’s meow! In 1925, Hal and Helen Davis wrote in Better Homes and Gardens “Awnings - they have such possibilities, such delightful possibilities,
that foolish indeed is a house to go without them, if they can be afforded.” That’s right, we just got called fools by the Davis family! Honestly this article is a useful tool for understanding how they were spreading. It even breaks down the differences in awning configurations
by locale and the pros and cons of various types. This used to be a big deal! And they were a selling point for your home - real estate firms are beginning to learn the value! Plus they’re just a fun accent piece. I mean, who wouldn’t want to flaunt their unusually picturesque nature
with a cool set of Arabian Awnings? The spears really sell it. But hundred year old magazine articles are one thing and the real world is another. How big were awnings really? Well, if you dingle around on the ol’ Streetview and visit
practically any old Chicago neighborhood, you’ll find plenty of houses which still have exterior window awnings
providing that overhang for shade, especially on South and West-facing windows. You can see in this image how effective they are: this side of the house is being hit with direct sunlight,
but the awning is almost entirely shading the window below it. Thanks to that awning, the old front room
is staying much cooler than it would without it. Many of these products also allowed you to leave windows open in the rain - at least if they were installed correctly and you had the right kind of window. They offered a lot of benefits! Yet despite remaining extant in various styles, the functional purpose of window awnings seems
to have almost entirely left the public consciousness. Why’d this happen? I’m gonna say it’s a mix of two factors:
air conditioning and fashion. The advent of mechanical air conditioning diminished the importance
of the passive tricks we used to rely on to keep cool. As more and more people started hooking up
energy-consuming air conditioners to the power grid (boy I hope it can keep up with all that… sorry wrong topic). As more and more people got air conditioning,
suddenly the temperature in their home was controllable. And so long as those air conditioners were powerful enough
to overcome the heat gain of solar irradiance, the awnings that previously helped keep us cool in a heatwave 
didn’t seem necessary any longer. And, technically, they weren’t. So, fast forward a decade or two,
and new homes are getting built without them. No need for awnings when we can pump the heat right out! That meant that all the older homes with awnings started to look dated. And if there’s one sin in the fashion world, it’s looking dated. As you can tell I take this very seriously. Beyond fashion, though, awnings on a home
may very well have been a sign that the home didn’t have air conditioning, and I’ll bet many a realtor in the 1960’s
suggested taking them down. ""No one wants a house with awnings,"" they’d say, 
""those are for old fuddy duddies. And poor people."" And now, other than that one infomercial, awnings are largely forgotten. But dang it, I think it’s time for us 
to consider bringing them back. For one, I actually think window awnings are pretty cute. Maybe not the aluminum ones that you still run across sometimes,
though hey - they sure proved their longevity. But there are so many different styles of awning out there,
plus many more to be discovered. And like those 1920’s people, I think window awnings
offer a real way to put a personal touch on a home. And what’s cooler than a way to express yourself that also literally keeps you cool? There’s a lot to like about them! Heat waves would be a lot more manageable with window awnings
keeping the sun’s heat outside your home, and day to day they save money on electricity bills. How much money? Well, unfortunately, that’s not the easiest thing to answer. It's annoyingly hard to get an idea of how much heat energy is actually coming through a window when the sun shines through it. It depends on so many factors: your location on the planet,
the direction the window faces, the time of the year, time of day, and of course the performance of the window itself all matter a lot. Still, I wanted to give you some useful information so I reached out to someone who has access to modeling software which can predict the energy needs of a home. They took a typical house in Chicago and ran some numbers for
heating and cooling demand while tweaking a few variables. There’s a lot of interesting stuff to cover here but what I want to highlight first is this: Doing nothing to the house but adding window overhangs 
reduced the annual cooling energy needed by 20%. That’s a big deal! But you’ll notice that other things had an impact, too. And if you notice even harder, you’ll see that those impacts were all double-edged. In the past, I’ve mentioned Low-E windows. That’s kind of a catch-all term and doesn’t mean a whole awful lot on its own,
but broadly it just means high-performance windows. And one of a window’s performance metrics is the solar heat gain coefficient. You can think of this as the percentage
of the sun’s heat energy that makes it through the glass. There are windows on the market now with exceptionally low SHGCs: some windows don’t even let a quarter of the sun’s energy through, and those are great to have in warm climates 
where you rarely ever need to heat buildings. But they’re often not a great fit for us up North because
over the course of a year we need more heat energy than we need cooling, and blocking the sun’s free heat doesn’t make much sense. Notice that in our modeling, swapping out just the South facing windows to a lower SHGC dropped cooling demand a pretty similar amount to adding overhangs. But look what it did to the heating demand. It went up significantly because those windows
are actually working against us in the winter. Our winters suck and some free heat from the sun is a very welcome thing. So there’s a tradeoff to changing the window’s thermal performance characteristics. And have you noticed what the lowest total annual power figure came from? Windows with high solar heat gain coefficients for free heating in the winter
but which had overhangs to block sunlight in the summer. That’s the beauty of awnings. We don’t have to make the choice between
winter and summer performance when buying a window. We could use a window best-suited for winter heat gains
and then in the summer just block the sun from hitting it with an awning. The reason why I’m making this video now is that, 
well, it occurred to me that there isn’t really a difference between a properly-installed window awning and some of the 
rather advanced home design techniques we see today. Those with lots of money to spend when designing their new custom homes
might get fancy and install different window types. One method I’ve talked about before is installing high heat-gain windows below an overhang so they provide that free heat in the winter but not in the summer. And then use low-heat-gain windows elsewhere in the house. That’s a cool idea but it’s a lot of work compared to slapping on an awning! And the best thing about slapping on an awning
(besides how fun that is to say) is that it can be done cheaply and anywhere! Speaking of anywhere, here’s a clunky voiceover edit. I’m worried that I fixated too much on the scenario we face here
and not enough on warm and hot climates. Because even if you’ve got the best dang windows on the market with an SHGC of .2, five average-sized West-facing windows (I’m calling 3 by 5 feet average) are going to let in more than a kilowatt of heat for several hours every afternoon. That’s not far off from running a space heater on high,
and when it’s 100 degrees outside that’s not the smartest move. For giggles I decided to look at some new homes
getting built around Phoenix, Arizona and it’s frankly astonishing to me that in that climate
there’s apparently no focus paid on window overhangs. Sure, back in the day we didn’t have the fancy glass we do now, but if window awnings were popular here in Chicago,
where it’s really only hot 4… maybe 5 months of the year, it seems to me like there’s a lot of energy and money being wasted by not thinking of ways to keep windows in the shade. Now, there's a couple of notes I want to add. Both myself and the person who helped me with the modeling here
are a bit skeptical of some of the data it spat out. The impact of dark closed drapes when there’s already
a 2.5 foot overhang seems really high, and the fact that those drapes by themselves are lowering cooling power
more than the overhangs seems… impossible. Drapes on the inside of a window
don’t stop sunlight from passing through the window glass. At best, if they’re very reflective, they can push some of the sun's energy back out but having stood next to a West-facing window with a white roller shade, I can say from experience that that shade gets pretty stinking hot on summer afternoons. It is always better to keep the sun from coming through the glass
in the first place, that way there is no greenhouse effect, so how this model is considering those factors seems a bit off. Really, if there’s one call to action I want to make here it would be that
there needs to be more study on the effectiveness of window awnings. It’s quite strange how little information there is on this topic, and most of what I’ve found are claims from 
awning manufacturers so I’m not exactly taking them seriously. But it does seem pretty obvious to me that if you can 
eliminate direct sunlight transmission through a window, then you’re effectively turning any window into a
North-facing window no matter which side of your house it’s on. And that could make a dramatic difference in the warm parts of the year. Unless you’re in the Southern hemisphere in which case,
strike that - reverse it. Now, it’s not like awnings don’t come with any drawbacks. Most obvious is that they make the interior of your home much darker during the day. If the awning is made of a translucent material
you could still get plenty of filtered light coming through the window, but its entire purpose is to eliminate direct sunlight and if that’s something you or your cat appreciates, well a proper awning is going to eliminate it. Although, I am quite curious about the potential effectiveness of a transparent awning made from glass with a really low solar heat gain coefficient. That might be a way to have the best of both worlds. And it would leave your view of the sky mostly unimpeded. Then there’s maintenance. The aluminum ones that still hang around were designed
in response to the fiddle factor of fancy fabrics. Those fabrics would fade with time and required periodic cleaning,
and depending on the design of the support structure, removing the fabric from the awning could be a pain in the butt. A rigid awning made of aluminum mostly took care of these problems,
and that’s most likely why they started spreading. Then again, materials science has improved dramatically
since awnings went out of fashion, and some fabric awnings can be selectively deployed. A roller-awning can be retracted when you don’t need or want it, and don’t look now but throw some Wi-Fi and actuators into the mix and you’ve got yourself a Smart Awning that could deploy exactly as much as needed and stay retracted on cloudy days or in inclement weather. The last main drawback to awnings that I can think of is pests. Through providing shelter for your window you’re also providing shelter for living creatures, and while I’d be pretty cool with a robin’s nest outside my window, a wasp nest is less cool. Then again, if the window is screened it’s not like that really matters all that much but I’ve dealt with my share of wasp nests
and usually it’s best to not have to deal with them. But to be honest, all of those drawbacks seem pretty minor to me,
and many of them aren’t even a thing all the time. I can tell you that I would freaking love some
awnings on my home - particularly on the West side. I’m still doing that thing where I only run the air conditioning in the overnight hours and one of the most interesting things
that technique has revealed is the dramatic effect of the sun. On cloudy days, even though it might be quite hot outside,
my home only heats up by 5 or 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of the day. But if it’s a sunny day at the same temperature, that just about doubles. Of course, not all of that is heat from the windows - the 
attic’s also getting stupid hot from the sun, and so are the walls. So it’s not easy to isolate that variable. But I can say it is truly remarkable how quickly the rooms on the West side start to heat up once the sun reaches those windows. Awnings aren’t the only solution, of course. There’s been a whole bunch of Europeans just champing at the commenting bit to let you know all about those exterior roller shutters they’ve had over there for a while. Those are interesting, and they’re starting to be sold here, but I’m curious to know how hot those shutters get in the sun. When closed they seem to trap a bit of air between them and the window glass,
so while I have no doubt they’re blocking the sun, it seems to me like the window will be getting quite warm
as the shutters radiate their absorbed heat into that airspace. I’d rather have an awning, then that heat isn’t trapped and I can still look outside! Then there are exterior blinds.
I’m starting to see these spread, often on porches. They’re basically the same idea as Rolladen 
but usually fabric and not integrated into the window frame or anything. Again, those will absolutely do the job of blocking sunlight from hitting the window, but they also block the view when in use which awnings don’t,   at least not the view out. If I seem gung-ho about awnings, well I am! I think they’re cool and have been tragically overlooked for the past half-century. Which brings me to one last thing. I live in a townhome which means if I wanted to install window awnings,
I’d need to get the HOA involved. And that’s not fun. So - circling back to that earlier call to action
where I said we should do more research on them, if it turns out that window awnings actually could 
reduce a typical home’s cooling costs by 20%, then whaddya say we go ahead and neuter an HOA’s 
ability to forbid their installation? Or, if that sounds too extreme, at the very least force HOAs
to offer an assortment of approved styles and colors. Something tells me we’re going to want to find more and different ways to keep cool as these heat domes keep happening, and if something as simple as a window awning is as useful as it seems to be,
uhh we should probably encourage their use. Alright, well that’s it! If anyone out there is involved in evaluating building energy codes and all that fun stuff, please chime in with any info you might have on this topic. I really didn’t find anything specifically about awnings and how much they could reduce cooling costs, and from what I’ve heard there really isn’t much attention paid 
to the effects of window overhangs at all outside of hyper-nerd circles. If window awnings were helpful before air conditioning,
then surely they’re still helpful now. And given how a lot of new housing stock, even in places like Arizona,
is getting built without window overhangs at all, either these new windows are miraculous marvels
or we just kinda forgot the tricks of the past. Here’s to giving some of them another go. ♫ blisteringly smooth jazz ♫ …pretty universally liked. They let in natural light and allow us to look outside and see things! But… what was that? Probably nothing you heard but I stopped anyway. There’s gotta be two good takes in there. I forgot how to tie a tie, I had to look it up! It’s been too long. Those grand covered porches you see on fancy… I am restarting this line. An awning on the porch permits the use of the 
porch when the hot afternoon sun is shining. They will keep the porch shaft and pleasant, and this also reduces the temperature - I can skip the rest of this line
because I already recorded the thing with the tie. That might be a way to have the best of both worlds. And it wood pfftehh…. [falls apart] [angry sigh] OK, so we gotta come up with some sort of pitch. Oooh, pitch. Baseball! Awnings: like a baseball cap for your house! Or maybe.... AWWWWWW nings."

qSFNufruSKw,LED Christmas lights which don&#39;t hurt the eyes: it finally happened!,At last I see the light. links 'n' stuff: VINTAGLO: https://www.seasonsreflection.com/vintaglo Tru-Tone: https://tru-tone.com/ ...,Technology Connections,2024-11-30T17:13:12Z,28,[],PT24M51S,1575154,8729,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)'],True,"As we reach the end of this year’s No Effort November, it’s time once again for me to embark
on my silly quest to make LED Christmas lights suck less. If you’re new to this tradition,
for the past seven years I have been making the same stupid yearly video where I attempt to both explain what irritates me 
about today’s Christmas lights and where I attempt my own fixes to make modern, 
energy-efficient LED technology look just like the Christmas lights of my youth. ♫ Hallelujah from Handel's Messiah starts ♫ 
And guess what? This year, I didn’t have to do a thing! That’s right, it finally happened! You see those beautiful red, yellow, blue, and green 
incandescent mini-lights behind me? Yeah, well, it turns out
the ones on the left side of the screen aren’t incandescent at all! They’re Vintaglos, a line of LED Christmas lights
from the Seasons Reflection Company which are exactly, to a T, the thing I have been trying to make this whole time! I was able to just buy my way out of this nonsense and I couldn’t be happier! Now, this video is going to be much more than a simple celebration
of the fact that someone finally understood the assignment but before we get any further, it is important to me that you know I bought these with my own money
and I have absolutely no relationship with this company. I found out about these through my friend Dan and immediately ordered some to see if they were as good as they looked. And they were, so I immediately ordered much more. These are not cheap: these are $25 per set of 100 (though at the time of video release they are currently on sale for $20 per set if ordered via their website) and they aren’t perfect. They’re extremely close to perfect, so my complaints are just nitpicks, but I will go over them in the spirit of fair product reviews. Before we get there, though, I want to back up 
and explain the problem that these have mercifully fixed once more. Because, well, I’ve not done a very great job of that in years past
which I can tell because of how excited people got to share these with me. Yes, the Midwest's own Menards has come out with a line of
supposedly vintage LED Christmas lights which, at a glance, sure do look like the sort of thing I’ve been asking for. They have deeply-colored caps - I think they’re even glass - which
look awfully close to this incandescent set, and aside from the inclusion of purple which I’m not thrilled by, this looks promising. Until you plug them in and... that happens. Yes, the diodes under those caps are color-matched to the cap. And that means the actual color produced by these lights is coming 
from the LEDs themselves which emit monochromatic light of a single wavelength. That spectral color is just plain ugly and way too harsh,
especially the greens and the blues. This is not what Christmas looks like, this is what a vape shop looks like. Or worse, a gaming PC. That was a joke, please don’t come after me. What do I mean by monochromatic light and color-matched diodes? Well, okay, I don’t want to go too deeply down the rabbit 
hole of human vision and color theory yet again but the visible spectrum of light is simply electromagnetic radiation
that our peepers happen to be able to detect, wavelengths between 750 and roughly 400 nanometers. Each of the individual wavelengths along that range 
is interpreted by our eyes and brains as a color. It’s literally the rainbow: that visual phenomenon allows 
us to see the entire visible light spectrum from the reds on the long end to the violets on the short end 
and everything in-between. There was also a Pink Floyd album about it or something. White light, the kind of light the sun makes 
as well as pretty much every kind of general illumination technology we’ve ever had (with a few noticeable exceptions) is a big ol’ mess of all those wavelengths, or at least a combination of wavelengths
that activates the color-detecting cones cells in our eyes roughly equally. If those cone cells are all activated together,
our brain interprets that as colorless, white light. But when that white light lands on colored objects,
those objects will absorb some wavelengths more than others, so the wavelengths that get reflected back to our eyes are a little different and they activate our cone cells in a different ratio which we interpret as a color. But light which appears colored due to reflecting off of something
is very different from a light source which itself is colored. Before the LED came along and
both made everything better and screwed everything up, when we wanted a light source to be a particular color
we had to start with white light and then filter out the wavelengths we don’t want. That’s what’s going on with this set of Christmas lights: these are the same exact incandescent filaments as these, producing a full-spectrum white light, but before that light exits the glass it goes through a color filter 
which only lets some wavelengths through. Now, here’s the key thing: This filtering is not perfect. The green filter, for example, doesn’t let a single wavelength of green light through, 
it lets a cluster of wavelengths in the region of green through. And that means this green is not a pure spectral color - it’s awfully green, to be sure,
but notice that when I get up real close and look at the filament directly, the actual hot glowing filament producing the light looks…
more of a lime green than an emerald green. It looks that way because we’re looking at the very brightest spot
and that imperfection in the color filtering becomes more noticeable. If I unfocus the camera's lens so we’re not able to see the filament, the green appears much more intense and really does look like an emerald green but it’s still not a spectral color. Light-emitting diodes, on the other hand, well they do emit spectral colors. LEDs emit light of a single wavelength. Just one. So whatever wavelength of “green” is being emitted by a green LED
is the one and only color of light it will ever appear to be. And in this light set, those are green LEDs. Yes, they have a dark green color filter over them, but that filter isn’t doing anything! There’s a single wavelength of light being emitted by the diode, 
so that filter literally cannot change the appearance of the light that makes it through. It might reduce the output a little bit, but it’s going to look the same 
exact piercing green no matter what. That is why these LED light sets look so stinking harsh. They are a cluster of colors which are
literally as intense as they can possibly appear to our eyes, and while some of you may like that, I really don’t. Especially when it comes to blue: incandescent light sets have pretty dull blues because incandescent filaments don’t produce that much light on the shorter end of the visible light spectrum. So when you’re filtering out all the long wavelengths
(the reds, oranges, yellows and greens), you just don’t have that much light output left. It’s still a very pretty and intense blue color,
but it’s not overwhelming the rest of the colors at all like it is here. And the greens in an LED light set are almost always just as bad to my eyes. The wildest thing to me about this problem is that it’s trivially easy to fix! White LEDs have been a thing for a long time now,
and they just keep getting better and better every year. These days we have LED lighting which is virtually 
indistinguishable from incandescent lighting, made possible by complex phosphor coatings which shift blue and
near-UV wavelengths emitted by the diodes down to all the other wavelengths of light we need to 
produce what looks like white light. And what I’ve been doing these past seven years
is buying white LED Christmas light sets and painting them with various colored stuffs
to demonstrate that that is, in fact, a thing which could be done! I found it kind of baffling that nobody else had had this thought. Why not just make Christmas lights exactly like we
always used to do before LEDs were a thing but swap the incandescent filaments
 for a nice, warm-white light-emitting diode? Then we could have the best of both worlds! Luckily, a few years ago Tru-Tone started up and did exactly that. Tru-Tone makes incredible C7 and C9 
Christmas lights which I’ve talked about before. These are made exactly like the incandescent bulbs of the past but rather than have a tungsten filament generating the light, 
they have a warm white LED faux-filament inside. And they’re amazing! They are essentially perfect, the only thing that gives them away as LED is the fact that they are actually flashing 120 times per second with the incoming AC power, but unless you’re very sensitive to that you probably won’t notice 
unless you move your eyes really quickly while staring at them. Now, because this idea is so obvious,
for better and worse Tru-Tone is starting to get imitators. Menards, as a matter of fact, is now selling 
ceramic multicolored C7 and C9 light sets which are just about as good. However, Tru-Tone is still the only place
that I know of to get these transparent colored C-style bulbs - this is what Menards is selling and… yeah it’s awful. Those are colored diodes under the glass 
and they shoot into the eyes like laser beams. But, personally, I don’t use these big lights very much or at all. I’ve always been a mini-light person - I just prefer the way 
they look in most applications and that’s what I grew up with. Tru-Tone doesn’t make any of these, 
and nobody else has understood the assignment quite correctly. Lots of retailers are selling things now which are vintage-ish, and for what it’s worth I actually do kind of like this new implementation where a tiny diode under a resin blob is sticking up into the envelope - that mimics the look of a filament pretty well. However, that’s nowhere near as important to me as the color accuracy and so I’ve just been patiently experimenting with ways to hand-color 
these LED lights to figure out a half-decent way to get what I want. Over the years I’ve tried sharpies, I’ve tried nail polish, I’ve tried spray paint, craft paint, transparent craft paint, dyed resin, literal dye like for clothing, and other things I’m sure I’ve forgotten
 and while most of them worked to various extents, they were either extremely annoying to apply 
or had some sort of flaw which annoyed me. The best option so far has been transparent modelling paint applied with an airbrush. I let this light set stay out all summer and, surprisingly,
the colors haven’t really faded at all. Uh, half the set doesn't work cuz a wire broke but the colors haven't faded at all so if worse comes to worst there’s always this option. But this year, oh this year, I have finally found the holy grail. Someone who bothered to do this at the time of 
manufacturing and pulled the strings to put a product called Vintaglo into the world. And they really went above and beyond. First, let’s ignore this multicolored set and instead look at this white set. This is, without a doubt,
the best-looking set of white miniature Christmas lights I have ever seen. Most white LED sets have diodes which can best be described as… cheap. They’re often not unpleasant to look at - I have seen 
some fairly nice golden-white colors over the years. But the quality of the light that they cast is… pretty craptastic. If you were to illuminate a room using a typical set 
of white LED Christmas lights, well it would look very wrong. The color rendering index on those LEDs is poop. These, though, these are warm-white diodes that 
you could light a room with and actually be happy. The light they cast on objects looks perfectly normal. This is so close to what an actual incandescent light sets look like
that I have exactly zero complaints. The only thing I could possibly wish for was some smoothing 
so these weren’t strobing at 120 Hz, which I can notice. However the fact that these actually are full-wave rectified
is itself a huge and rather uncommon bonus. A lot of AC-powered light sets like this are only half-wave rectified
which means they flash at only 60 Hz which is super noticeable. These appear to be burning quite steadily and it’s hard to notice the strobing at all. Great stuff. A base of actually-good warm-white diodes laid the groundwork 
for the thing I’ve been hoping for years someone would finally just do: put those same warm white diodes under intensely-colored plastic caps so we can have a multicolored light set which actually looks 
warm and festive rather than laserbeamy and technodystopian. And that’s exactly what these are. And in my preferred color scheme, too! I don’t care for pinks, teals, or oranges in my Christmas lights, 
and I cherish the way the yellow pops out against the other colors. I have always felt this combination looks nicest, 
especially at a distance since you can still make out different colors. When yellow is swapped for orange or amber, at a distance 
that combination looks like a dull orangey-red mess to me, and when there’s another warm color in there like pink or magenta, 
I find it really hard to pick out the green and blue at all. But anyway, pedantic color preferences aside this is as close to perfect as I could reasonably expect. Next to a real incandescent light set with the same color scheme, they're nearly indistinguishable! The green is slightly desaturated on the Vintaglo set and the yellow itself has just a tinge of green in it - I think I know why and I’ll explain that later - but honestly that’s just nitpicking. I’ve decorated with a whole bunch of these light sets
 and oh boy it’s hitting me right in the childhood. I could not be happier. And the sets have some other quality-of-life improvements, too. Out of the box the wires are remarkably flexible. Usually when you get a new set of lights like this you have to really stretch it out to keep it from accordioning back on itself but these hardly need that at all. Which says to me the wire and insulation was specced really well. The overall quality of the lamp holders and plugs is really top-notch, 
but I will grant that's not saying that much - these are the same basic things in every set of lights 
but they’re at least among the best of the same basic things I’ve seen. So what are my complaints? Well, I have two: one of which is technical,
the other has to do with quality control. I’ll start with QC - a couple of the sets that I bought have a few blue lights 
which didn’t seem to get a very strong coating of color on the cap. Which was a bummer for two reasons: one, I was really hoping the plastic itself would be colored that way the coloring was throughout the plastic and it was less likely to fade with time and sun exposure. It does appear to be just a coating, though it may very well hold up much better than the coloring on glass incandescent sets so perhaps I have no reason to be bummed about that at all. But besides potential longevity issues,
the mere fact that a few of the lights have inconsistent coloring is… disappointing. Not a huge deal at all, but a little disappointing. The second complaint is technical and one that will probably be pretty hard to fix. While these warm-white LEDs are fantastic, there’s no way that they’re actually producing the same
 full-spectrum output that a glowing incandescent filament does. I’m much too lazy to get my hands on a spectroscope to show you this but white LEDs actually have fairly spiky spectral emissions which our eyes almost never notice -  they’re tuned really well these days and you have to have a 
really good sense of color rendering to ever notice that but… in this case, because we’re using a color filter on a light 
source which has somewhat spiky spectral output,   the color filtering doesn’t behave exactly the 
same way as it does with an incandescent filament. Now, before you think this is a big deal, 
let me be clear that it’s absolutely not. The effect of this is miniscule but it’s probably why I’m 
seeing a teeny bit of a green tinge coming from the yellow lights. To make yellow light from a white light source you really just have to filter out 
blue and violet wavelengths and you can let the rest through. To our eyes a combination of red and green wavelengths looks like yellow - that’s how your screen is making this yellow right now. It’s just red and green subpixels lighting up together. But this filter over an LED isn’t going to let a huge collection of wavelengths 
starting at green and ending at red through, it’s letting… whatever spiky emissions from the white diode are shorter than blue, and if the green is a little strong compared to, say, orangey wavelengths, well you’re gonna be able to see it. And I can. In an actual display of lights this is practically irrelevant. When I look at the decorations I’ve put up, I can’t notice this at all. They look exactly like I want them to look. However, where it is more noticeable 
is in the overall glow that the light sets as a whole produce. Again, this is super nitpicky stuff, but if I have an 
incandescent set of these multicolored lights up in my window, then at night they produce a very warm, pleasant glow in the room itself. These don’t quite do that. It’s not bad by any means, but it's not the same. It’s a little too green and a little too… 
artificial, I think that’s the best word to use. But in all reality, that’s a tiny, tiny complaint. When you’re actually looking at the lights themselves, you’d be hard pressed to know these are LEDs unless you get up close enough to actually see the tiny little diode chilling at the base of the cap. And that is, in a word, fantasicawesomazing. I am so thrilled that these exist and I really, really hope this continues to be a thing. There are so many advantages to LED Christmas light sets - obviously they use hardly any power at all, 
we’re talking about 5 watts per set of 100 rather than 40. And that means you can connect dozens of these light sets end to end 
(Vintaglo claims 48) rather than just three or four. And of course they should last much, much longer 
(at least if handled carefully and removed and stored promptly) since they’re not incandescent and they won’t 
start burning out by the end of the second year. Yet until this year, I have never found a set 
of multicolored LED mini lights that I could tolerate. They have always been… that. I strongly dislike that. There have been a few sets which I can stomach a little better - a few years ago Walmart had some which actually had far fewer 
blue LEDs than any other color which really tamed things,   and they did have yellow. In fact that yellow was made by using a white LED under a yellow cap, and that’s really good because prior to that the actually-yellow LEDs which were used in multicolored sets were extremely dull compared to the rest. At least the yellow is actually bright now - and this is actually repeated 
in these Menards so-called-vintage lights. Which is both great and infuriating because 
it means whoever is in charge of the larger Christmas light industry seems to understand the value of putting a warm white LED under a colored cap but for some reason has decided yellow is the only color they’re gonna do that for. The red is still pure red, the green and blue are still pure and disgusting green and blue, and in this set the purple... honestly I’m wondering if that’s a UV diode. It excited the phosphorescent print 
on that clock back there so it’s definitely violet if not UV. But anyway, at long last the folks behind Vintaglo have actually done it. And for that, I am very grateful. There is, of course, a link in the description 
to the product page for these if you wish to order some and I really, really hope that they’ll be taking pre-orders 
if and when they sell out of this year’s inventory. It’s possible that they may offer more color combinations
 in the future besides this objectively best one... though I understand some people disagree with me. I've also included a link to Tru-Tone in the spirit of supporting small, independent businesses and I wish them continued success as well. OK, well. Uh, that’s it. Both for this video and for No Effort November. And, y'know, this might very well be the last time I have to make this video. Clearly there is a strong yearning 
for vintage-looking yet modern-tech Christmas lights - lots of big box stores are starting to sell variations on the vintage theme. But so far they really just haven’t gotten it! At all! [tumbling boxes] It takes a special kind of nerd to insist on the correct diodes driven the correct way placed under the correctly-colored caps using the correct manufacturing procedures and so far I know of only two small companies who have 
such a dedicated nerd in their ranks. But I’m so glad they exist and that they actually got it done. Happy holidays to everyone out there, and may your festive displays glow with the cozy, welcoming warmth the season deserves. ♫ we-wish-you-a-merry-christmasedly smooth jazz ♫ Sorry, no bloopers this time. There were only two and I didn’t feel they’d be worth it. I mean, neither was great and then it would just be silly 
to have two and be like “yucks, no more bloopers” so you just get this explanation instead! Oh and some pretty lights. Those are incandescent twinkling lights

the world first learned to split the atom nuclear energy has been a source of immense hope and of lingering fear by any human metric the potential of nuclear power is all but Limitless with the potential for just a few hundred modern reactors to supply carbon free energy to an entire continent at a time yet fears of catastrophic nuclear meltdown long-standing concerns of radioactive waste and the undeniable connection between world changing nuclear energy and world-ending nuclear weapons have longk kept planet Earth from a true nuclear Revolution but what if a new approach to nuclear energy came along and changed the game what if not by magic or by Miracle but by straightforward Nuclear Physics an atomic scientist near you promised that with the wave of a hand and a few billion dollars for research they could provide a safer cleaner more peaceful alternative to the nuclear power industry that we've known for so long this isn't some new uranium isotope it's not some new element from the depths of the periodic table and it's not nuclear fusion it's thorum an alternative fuel that many nuclear scientists believe to be not just a gateway to a massively improved nuclear industry but a bridge between modern power infrastructure and a nuclear fusion Revolution that's still decades away unlike Fusion thorium is ready now and if the world can put Theory into practice then a whole lot of things are about to change so beat thorium it's element number 90 on the periodic table sandwiched between a couple of elements the average person has never heard of and for most of human history thorium's been just another rock first discovered in 1828 thorium is relatively abundant it's a silvery substance that can be extracted in small amounts from most rocks and Sands it exists in nature in one single form and while that form is technically unstable it decays slowly enough that its Half-Life is multiple times the current age of the planet it's also used in light bulbs High refractive camera lenses and Ceramics and it's named after the norcot of Thunder Thor but the thing that makes thorium special is its properties relative to an element that the world has gotten to know a little bit better over the last century uranium thorium is situated just two spots away from Uranium on the periodic table and unlike uranium thorium is not a material that can be useful as a nuclear fuel it's only natural occurring isotope thorium 232 is fishable but it's not file that is to say it's an atom that is more difficult to split in nuclear reaction than uranium is to get it to split you've got to bombard it with high energy neutrons irradiating it until a fisar reaction finally takes place uranium 235 the file isotope of uranium that fuels nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs is far easier to trigger in a nuclear fishion but when thorium is irradiated with sufficient energy to cause a fishing reaction it produces a different isotope of uranium than the Isotopes that the modern nuclear industry relies on instead the so-called fertile isotope thorium 232 can be used to create an artificial uranium isotope uranium 233 while it's the thorium fuel cycle that we're discussing today it's this special sort of uranium a byproduct of the fisar reaction that nuclear scientists are really after as for why it might be better to presume nuclear power by thorium's f cycles and uranium's well we'll be diving deep on that in just a moment but before we do here are some of the highlights thorium is far easier to obtain it's much more abundant it creates much safer byproducts and it is far harder to put the byproducts of a thorium fuel cycle into a nuclear bomb with those sorts of advantages it's pretty easy to see why thorium would generate some curiosity around the world but the mere fact that thorium reactors are a Hot Topic in the 2020s doesn't mean that they're A New Concept s in fact several Nations particularly the United States have known about the potential value of thorium for decades and the reason why it hasn't been adopted is nothing to do with efficacy you see thorium reactors were first worked out conceptually during the Boomers of nuclear science in the decade or two after the conclusion of the second world war around that time scientists in the US were hard at work building uranium based nuclear reactors with the fuel and potential to do more than turn the lights on they also created the ice isotope plutonium 239 today used as the primary FAL material in modern nuclear weapons but back in the 1960s the US was still exploring alternatives to traditional uranium fueled reactors and one group in particular The Oakridge National Laboratory in the US state of Tennessee got to work on a peculiar project a so-called molten salt reactor back then molten salt reactors were mostly known in the US government as byproduct of an embarrassing decade and a half long attempt to build a nuclear power bomber aircraft oid had been responsible for building the reactor for the bomber but their issues with building a reactor in the conventional style had led to the laboratory investigating other methods of nuclear power generation at the time the rapid expansion of nuclear power and the relative lack of naturally occurring uranium around the world had led many within the energy world to fear that uranium would eventually run out even as back in those days much of the world believed the nuclear energy would be so cheap and abundant that it would be practically free via their molten salt reactor Oakridge was able to use the far more abundant thorium to derive uranium 233 and that in turn went back into the reactor to fuel it by 1969 the eorum reactor was running at full power and it would spend over 13,000 hours generating energy over the course of the experiment in one documentary produced about the reactor decades later nuclear scientist Kirk senson had claimed that if the US had continued working with the reactor and taking advantage of the technological gains that came with it then America might have gone fully energy Independent by the year 2000 but alas it wasn't to be the reactor was plagued with technical issues and its handlers couldn't get it to produce nearly as much power as they' initially hoped shutdowns were common the electrical system was unable to handle the reactor all told it was underwhelming but that alone isn't enough to outweigh the potential benefits of continuing the experiment and figuring out how to use a thorium reactor and indeed that isn't what doomed the thing instead the star optimism around uranium reactors and the new realizations about uranium's abundance were enough to help leading Atomic scientists decide that their more developed uranium based technology was the way of the future the uranium fuel cycle was proven the reactors were already way ahead of where thorium reactors had been at the time and the clear safety benefits of the thorium reactors were deemed not quite important enough to continue their development finally the death of the thorium reactor always a product of its time at time when words like non-proliferation can get a person laughed out of a meeting and when the plutonium produced as part of the uranium fuel cycle oh is considered absolutely vital to build more nuclear bombs thorium reactors wouldn't just fail to produce anything that could go boom their widespread adoption risked compromising the nuclear weapon supply chain France would be the only other Nation to seriously attempt a thorium reactor in the 20th century and while their attempt the super fex oh would operate for over a decade it was hamstrung by long series of accidents and Technical barriers now though in the 21st century thorium is back on the table and in fact it's fast becoming an international Sprint to the Finish Line in just a moment we're going to dive into the status of that race and learn more about how it's going but first we've got to understand why there's this race at [Music] all now we've run through the basic list of positives related to thorium reactor technology but now it's time that we dig into the details where the most obvious asset of thorium over uranium is its abundance according to the international atomic energy agency some 6.2 million metric tons of the stuff is estimated to be hiding under the Earth's crust that's about triple the amount of global reserves of uranium making it roughly as abundant as lead it's also far easier to get your hands on with thorium or also known as monazite typically containing significant amounts of thorium that can then be purified it's significantly safer and easier to physically mine than uranium since thorium mining can take place in open pits and just as it's save to mine it's save to useing reactors in fact thorium reactors at least as the world currently understands them cannot suffer a meltdown comparable to what conventional nuclear power plants might experience no Chernobyl no Fukushima no Three Mile Island the reactors are built in a way where they could be easily drained of their fuel in case of emergency and they cannot maintain nuclear reactions after powered mechanisms to stimulate the reaction no longer functioning Nord thorium reactors require any complex lists of input materials thorium is all they need once the reaction is initiated as a fertile isotope thorum makes everything else that's required to fuel the reactor and it produces more file material than it consumes meaning that no file material has to be introduced from the outside to sustain the reaction once it gets started thorium doesn't have to be enriched its natural isotope is perfectly capable of producing uranium 233 and according to a Nobel Lao working with the European Organization for nuclear research or CERN thorium is so efficient that it provides about 200 times the yield of energy for the same amount of substance as uranium if that figure isn't impressive enough then fear not because thorium's kilo for kilo power y ratio compared with coal is well 1 to 3 and A2 million also on the list of problems that thorium could solve is that of nuclear waste thorium reactors are estimated produced somewhere between 1% and 1 1% of the nuclear waste that a uranium fuel cycle reactor would while again granting a yield of about 200 times as much energy in the process the waste that it does produce is more stable from the moment it's generated and it's not as radioactive either it'll take only a few hundred years at most for the radiation emitting from those sources to drop to safe enough levels that humans can get close to them as opposed to tens of thousands of years for the nuclear waste that we produce today some thoran proponents suggest that by prods could drop to Safe radiation levels after just a couple of decades maybe even faster and finally thorium reactors have little if any potential to create byproducts that would be functionally useful in a nuclear weapon thorium itself is useless inside a bomb unless it's quite literally dropped onto somebody's head uranium 233 is file and thus can be used to create a nuclear weapon but it's an impractical way to create a bomb even under the best conditions thorium reactors do produce some plutonium as a byproduct but only a small fraction of what conventional uranium reactors produce and even the plutonium that does come out is wovely unsuitable for use in a bomb in fact thorium might even turn out to be a way to get rid of some of the plutonium waste that Humanity already has that same plutonium is useful in starting a thorium reaction so although thorium reactors aren't a way to burn up all of the excess plutonium the world has it can at least put a dent in the pile other byproducts of uran 233 that could technically be used to build a bomb or a poor choice to do so as they give off gamma rays that make them easily traced and tracked as well as posing a risk to the handlers now make no mistake thorium reactors like every other emerging technology certainly have their naysayers but the arguments against thorium have much more to do with startup costs and minor trade-offs than any major barriers to widespread adoption as this detractors often point out the thorium fuel cycle will require major investment and research before can be harnessed via modern technology there is no guarantee of a payoff at the end of all that research and past attempts to build thorium reactors have been beset by a wide variety of issues getting thorium ready for reactor use does cost more than conventional uranium preparation at least right now while Technologies are still emerging and production lines are not well built it's pulled from monoid or that also is used as a source of rare Earth elements demanding changes to current mining practices to prioritize thoran extraction and tension the heat required to melt thorium oxide and make a thorium fuel poses a challenge when designing the equipment to bring it to that temperature and one of the byproducts of thorium reactors the unstable isotope of uranium 232 does emit gamma rays requiring a different set of measures and mechanisms to keep a reactor's human operators from harm but each of these barriers is far outweighed by the potential benefits and much of the world seems to know it the nation that's put most in thorium reactors across history isn't the USA or Russia or China but a nation where uranium is scarce but where the largest thorium Supply in the world lurks just underneath its citizens feet India kept up research into thorium reactors long after the rest of the world passed it by and that work is now paid off development and testing of promising thorium reactor technology has been ongoing there for a decade although plans to build and finish a fullscale thorum reactor have yet to be realized India is pushing hard to achieve large scale power production via thorium over the course of the next two decades or and hopes to cover a large proportion of its electricity needs via thorium not long after India's leaders both past and present recognize that their nation is ideally suited to be a leader on thorium derived nuclear energy and it's been enshrined in India's civilian nuclear program since the founding father of that program a physicist named homie Bara made it a top priority over half a cent ago the country's push for thorium hasn't always been fruitful part of the reason that progress has been so slow is that India has refused to sign the Nuclear nonproliferation treaty and always was thus Iced Out of global resources pools that might otherwise have resolved its thorian problems but in 2024 its prototype fast breeder reactor was finally completed and it's expected to be operational by the end of this year and just across a frigid Himalayan border the nation of China is well on its way to matching if not outpacing India within a few short years China has been working toward a thorium reactor since at least 2011 and like India China has undertaken the work almost entirely by itself China however had the luxury of doing so by choice that same laboratory that built a modern salt reactor back in the 1960s Oak Ridge has since become one of the few foreign scientific entities to partner with China on that mission at the time of writing China is multiple thorium fuel cyle reactors in construction out in the GOI desert and just this year 2024 China confirms that one of those reactors will start operating in 2025 that pilot plants will produce only about 2 megawatts of electricity when fully operational but because of the broader robustness of China's nuclear industry the act of building a working thorium reactor will probably be more challenging than simply proliferating them later on China hopes to eventually build numerous thoran plants across its deserts and spread them to dozens of Nations involved with its belt and Road initiative around the globe in the United States after some early Whispers of collaboration with China in the 2010s the drive to build thorum reactor is still flagging the idea did pick up some Traction in US Congress even before 2010 and in 2020 the US Department of energy began an initiative to bring two prototype Next Generation reactors online with the door wide open to making an attempt at Thorium in 2022 however Congress introduced a bill entitled The thorium energy Security Act calling for the US to invest in the procurement of uranium 233 with the goal of building a national stockpile and eliminating any potential future dependency on other nations for the stuff although that particular Bill never made it to a flaw vote before a house of Congress a later Bill signed in 2024 put aside healthy sums of money to gather uranium 233 and called for the development of fuels for using quote future molten salt and high temperature gas reactor designs across the rest of the world Denmark stands out as a leader on thorium energy with the company Copenhagen atomics announcing in 2024 that its Molton salt reactor the was burner is finally ready for a real life attempt to reach criticality the West burner is a small reactor meant to be packed up and transported in a shipping container if need be and it uses plutonium derived from spent nuclear fuel to activate and begin the reaction process with fertile stores of thorium the RAS burner is expected to come online for the first time in Switzerland in 2026 elsewhere Canada has made some progress toward a thorium reactor Israel and Japan have shown some interest and one South African company is working overtime to design a thorium reactor that could alleviate the country's serious energy problems Indonesia and Norway have each demonstrated some willingness for research and development too as the race to a commercial thorium reactor really kicks off in the next few years the Nations involved a short ofine reasons to engage in Friendly or sometimes quite unfriendly competition but just like the thorium fuel cycle offers Myriad advantages over conventional nuclear power a thorium technology race promises to be a whole lot less intense than some of the other resource-based competitions around the world a big part of the reason why has to do with res availability according to the world nuclear Association India has the world's largest set of thorium reserves estimated to be 850,000 metric tons next is Brazil at 632,000 metric tons then Australia and the US with 600,000 metric tons each Egypt turkey Venezuela Canada Russia South Africa and China all believe to have 100,000 metric tons of reserves or more and often much much more unlike say Cobalts an incredibly important substance that the world depends largely on the Democratic Republic of the Congo to mine thorium is available in major reserves across many world Nations but even more important it's available on both sides of Stark geopolitical gaps that only seem to be getting more extreme Russia China and the US have all got substantial reserves of their own India and Brazil are likely to be very pleased to sell some of their thorium to Russia and China to make up for America's Head Start turkey along with the Scandinavian Nations can combine to yield 600,000 tons of the stuff or more for the European nations of NATO Venezuela will be more than happy to sell to Russia and Egypt likewise to China whatever the race to thoran power looks like it won't look like the current fight over Rare Earth elements for example where one major power China controls much of the market nor is Thorium an area where scarcity is likely to be an issue at its current levels of power consumption the United States for example is expected to have enough Thorium in the grounds to power it for the next a thousand years after which time it's true America would need to explore other options so would other world nations in the year 3024 be having intense conversations about what to do when the thorium runs out well by that point pretty unlikely they're going to be dependent on thorium it's highly unlikely that in the further future there's going to be a thing because the thorium fuel cycle is understood as a bridge technology truly Next Generation sustainable energy namely nuclear fusion aren't expected to yield substantial energy production until around 2050 and more conservative estimates can fall back to 2060 or even 2070 but let's be really pessimistic for a moment and say that Fusion won't be scaled up to that level for another Century until the 212s even then the US assuming a similar level of energy consumption will have burned through just 10% of the thorium it already knows about the same is true for the world's thorium reserves which are in Aggregate and after to power several centuries of better more sustainable more peaceful nuclear energy before the next energy Revolution arrives for the generations that come after RS make no mistake AK The Road to Mass adoption of the thorium fuel cycle will be a bumpy one the Technologies involved will still need to mature and policy makers the world over will need to choose thorium to complement or even replace more time- tested renewable and conventional energy sources the thorium fuel cycle industry as it emerges we'll have to sustain withering attacks from fossil fuel corporations conventional nuclear power Advocates and more and while the multilateral technology race may not be quite so bitter as some of the other ones the world's currently fighting it certainly won't be easy but the payoff waiting at the end is one of those potential Futures that seems almost too good to be true except with the distinct possibility of it actually being true as far as Humanity can tell the thorium fuel cycle does work it does have concrete promise and potential to meet specific technical

jSFo_92cJ-U,Thorium Reactors: Why is this Technology Quite So Exciting,"Is thorium the key to safe, sustainable nuclear power? Explore its history, game-changing potential, and the global race to harness ...",Megaprojects,2024-12-04T20:00:21Z,27,[],PT21M11S,1497209,4706,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society'],True,"since the world first learned to split the atom nuclear energy has been a source of immense hope and of lingering fear by any human metric the potential of nuclear power is all but Limitless with the potential for just a few hundred modern reactors to supply carbon free energy to an entire continent at a time yet fears of catastrophic nuclear meltdown long-standing concerns of radioactive waste and the undeniable connection between world changing nuclear energy and world-ending nuclear weapons have longk kept planet Earth from a true nuclear Revolution but what if a new approach to nuclear energy came along and changed the game what if not by magic or by Miracle but by straightforward Nuclear Physics an atomic scientist near you promised that with the wave of a hand and a few billion dollars for research they could provide a safer cleaner more peaceful alternative to the nuclear power industry that we've known for so long this isn't some new uranium isotope it's not some new element from the depths of the periodic table and it's not nuclear fusion it's thorum an alternative fuel that many nuclear scientists believe to be not just a gateway to a massively improved nuclear industry but a bridge between modern power infrastructure and a nuclear fusion Revolution that's still decades away unlike Fusion thorium is ready now and if the world can put Theory into practice then a whole lot of things are about to change so beat thorium it's element number 90 on the periodic table sandwiched between a couple of elements the average person has never heard of and for most of human history thorium's been just another rock first discovered in 1828 thorium is relatively abundant it's a silvery substance that can be extracted in small amounts from most rocks and Sands it exists in nature in one single form and while that form is technically unstable it decays slowly enough that its Half-Life is multiple times the current age of the planet it's also used in light bulbs High refractive camera lenses and Ceramics and it's named after the norcot of Thunder Thor but the thing that makes thorium special is its properties relative to an element that the world has gotten to know a little bit better over the last century uranium thorium is situated just two spots away from Uranium on the periodic table and unlike uranium thorium is not a material that can be useful as a nuclear fuel it's only natural occurring isotope thorium 232 is fishable but it's not file that is to say it's an atom that is more difficult to split in nuclear reaction than uranium is to get it to split you've got to bombard it with high energy neutrons irradiating it until a fisar reaction finally takes place uranium 235 the file isotope of uranium that fuels nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs is far easier to trigger in a nuclear fishion but when thorium is irradiated with sufficient energy to cause a fishing reaction it produces a different isotope of uranium than the Isotopes that the modern nuclear industry relies on instead the so-called fertile isotope thorium 232 can be used to create an artificial uranium isotope uranium 233 while it's the thorium fuel cycle that we're discussing today it's this special sort of uranium a byproduct of the fisar reaction that nuclear scientists are really after as for why it might be better to presume nuclear power by thorium's f cycles and uranium's well we'll be diving deep on that in just a moment but before we do here are some of the highlights thorium is far easier to obtain it's much more abundant it creates much safer byproducts and it is far harder to put the byproducts of a thorium fuel cycle into a nuclear bomb with those sorts of advantages it's pretty easy to see why thorium would generate some curiosity around the world but the mere fact that thorium reactors are a Hot Topic in the 2020s doesn't mean that they're A New Concept s in fact several Nations particularly the United States have known about the potential value of thorium for decades and the reason why it hasn't been adopted is nothing to do with efficacy you see thorium reactors were first worked out conceptually during the Boomers of nuclear science in the decade or two after the conclusion of the second world war around that time scientists in the US were hard at work building uranium based nuclear reactors with the fuel and potential to do more than turn the lights on they also created the ice isotope plutonium 239 today used as the primary FAL material in modern nuclear weapons but back in the 1960s the US was still exploring alternatives to traditional uranium fueled reactors and one group in particular The Oakridge National Laboratory in the US state of Tennessee got to work on a peculiar project a so-called molten salt reactor back then molten salt reactors were mostly known in the US government as byproduct of an embarrassing decade and a half long attempt to build a nuclear power bomber aircraft oid had been responsible for building the reactor for the bomber but their issues with building a reactor in the conventional style had led to the laboratory investigating other methods of nuclear power generation at the time the rapid expansion of nuclear power and the relative lack of naturally occurring uranium around the world had led many within the energy world to fear that uranium would eventually run out even as back in those days much of the world believed the nuclear energy would be so cheap and abundant that it would be practically free via their molten salt reactor Oakridge was able to use the far more abundant thorium to derive uranium 233 and that in turn went back into the reactor to fuel it by 1969 the eorum reactor was running at full power and it would spend over 13,000 hours generating energy over the course of the experiment in one documentary produced about the reactor decades later nuclear scientist Kirk senson had claimed that if the US had continued working with the reactor and taking advantage of the technological gains that came with it then America might have gone fully energy Independent by the year 2000 but alas it wasn't to be the reactor was plagued with technical issues and its handlers couldn't get it to produce nearly as much power as they' initially hoped shutdowns were common the electrical system was unable to handle the reactor all told it was underwhelming but that alone isn't enough to outweigh the potential benefits of continuing the experiment and figuring out how to use a thorium reactor and indeed that isn't what doomed the thing instead the star optimism around uranium reactors and the new realizations about uranium's abundance were enough to help leading Atomic scientists decide that their more developed uranium based technology was the way of the future the uranium fuel cycle was proven the reactors were already way ahead of where thorium reactors had been at the time and the clear safety benefits of the thorium reactors were deemed not quite important enough to continue their development finally the death of the thorium reactor always a product of its time at time when words like non-proliferation can get a person laughed out of a meeting and when the plutonium produced as part of the uranium fuel cycle oh is considered absolutely vital to build more nuclear bombs thorium reactors wouldn't just fail to produce anything that could go boom their widespread adoption risked compromising the nuclear weapon supply chain France would be the only other Nation to seriously attempt a thorium reactor in the 20th century and while their attempt the super fex oh would operate for over a decade it was hamstrung by long series of accidents and Technical barriers now though in the 21st century thorium is back on the table and in fact it's fast becoming an international Sprint to the Finish Line in just a moment we're going to dive into the status of that race and learn more about how it's going but first we've got to understand why there's this race at [Music] all now we've run through the basic list of positives related to thorium reactor technology but now it's time that we dig into the details where the most obvious asset of thorium over uranium is its abundance according to the international atomic energy agency some 6.2 million metric tons of the stuff is estimated to be hiding under the Earth's crust that's about triple the amount of global reserves of uranium making it roughly as abundant as lead it's also far easier to get your hands on with thorium or also known as monazite typically containing significant amounts of thorium that can then be purified it's significantly safer and easier to physically mine than uranium since thorium mining can take place in open pits and just as it's save to mine it's save to useing reactors in fact thorium reactors at least as the world currently understands them cannot suffer a meltdown comparable to what conventional nuclear power plants might experience no Chernobyl no Fukushima no Three Mile Island the reactors are built in a way where they could be easily drained of their fuel in case of emergency and they cannot maintain nuclear reactions after powered mechanisms to stimulate the reaction no longer functioning Nord thorium reactors require any complex lists of input materials thorium is all they need once the reaction is initiated as a fertile isotope thorum makes everything else that's required to fuel the reactor and it produces more file material than it consumes meaning that no file material has to be introduced from the outside to sustain the reaction once it gets started thorium doesn't have to be enriched its natural isotope is perfectly capable of producing uranium 233 and according to a Nobel Lao working with the European Organization for nuclear research or CERN thorium is so efficient that it provides about 200 times the yield of energy for the same amount of substance as uranium if that figure isn't impressive enough then fear not because thorium's kilo for kilo power y ratio compared with coal is well 1 to 3 and A2 million also on the list of problems that thorium could solve is that of nuclear waste thorium reactors are estimated produced somewhere between 1% and 1 1% of the nuclear waste that a uranium fuel cycle reactor would while again granting a yield of about 200 times as much energy in the process the waste that it does produce is more stable from the moment it's generated and it's not as radioactive either it'll take only a few hundred years at most for the radiation emitting from those sources to drop to safe enough levels that humans can get close to them as opposed to tens of thousands of years for the nuclear waste that we produce today some thoran proponents suggest that by prods could drop to Safe radiation levels after just a couple of decades maybe even faster and finally thorium reactors have little if any potential to create byproducts that would be functionally useful in a nuclear weapon thorium itself is useless inside a bomb unless it's quite literally dropped onto somebody's head uranium 233 is file and thus can be used to create a nuclear weapon but it's an impractical way to create a bomb even under the best conditions thorium reactors do produce some plutonium as a byproduct but only a small fraction of what conventional uranium reactors produce and even the plutonium that does come out is wovely unsuitable for use in a bomb in fact thorium might even turn out to be a way to get rid of some of the plutonium waste that Humanity already has that same plutonium is useful in starting a thorium reaction so although thorium reactors aren't a way to burn up all of the excess plutonium the world has it can at least put a dent in the pile other byproducts of uran 233 that could technically be used to build a bomb or a poor choice to do so as they give off gamma rays that make them easily traced and tracked as well as posing a risk to the handlers now make no mistake thorium reactors like every other emerging technology certainly have their naysayers but the arguments against thorium have much more to do with startup costs and minor trade-offs than any major barriers to widespread adoption as this detractors often point out the thorium fuel cycle will require major investment and research before can be harnessed via modern technology there is no guarantee of a payoff at the end of all that research and past attempts to build thorium reactors have been beset by a wide variety of issues getting thorium ready for reactor use does cost more than conventional uranium preparation at least right now while Technologies are still emerging and production lines are not well built it's pulled from monoid or that also is used as a source of rare Earth elements demanding changes to current mining practices to prioritize thoran extraction and tension the heat required to melt thorium oxide and make a thorium fuel poses a challenge when designing the equipment to bring it to that temperature and one of the byproducts of thorium reactors the unstable isotope of uranium 232 does emit gamma rays requiring a different set of measures and mechanisms to keep a reactor's human operators from harm but each of these barriers is far outweighed by the potential benefits and much of the world seems to know it the nation that's put most in thorium reactors across history isn't the USA or Russia or China but a nation where uranium is scarce but where the largest thorium Supply in the world lurks just underneath its citizens feet India kept up research into thorium reactors long after the rest of the world passed it by and that work is now paid off development and testing of promising thorium reactor technology has been ongoing there for a decade although plans to build and finish a fullscale thorum reactor have yet to be realized India is pushing hard to achieve large scale power production via thorium over the course of the next two decades or and hopes to cover a large proportion of its electricity needs via thorium not long after India's leaders both past and present recognize that their nation is ideally suited to be a leader on thorium derived nuclear energy and it's been enshrined in India's civilian nuclear program since the founding father of that program a physicist named homie Bara made it a top priority over half a cent ago the country's push for thorium hasn't always been fruitful part of the reason that progress has been so slow is that India has refused to sign the Nuclear nonproliferation treaty and always was thus Iced Out of global resources pools that might otherwise have resolved its thorian problems but in 2024 its prototype fast breeder reactor was finally completed and it's expected to be operational by the end of this year and just across a frigid Himalayan border the nation of China is well on its way to matching if not outpacing India within a few short years China has been working toward a thorium reactor since at least 2011 and like India China has undertaken the work almost entirely by itself China however had the luxury of doing so by choice that same laboratory that built a modern salt reactor back in the 1960s Oak Ridge has since become one of the few foreign scientific entities to partner with China on that mission at the time of writing China is multiple thorium fuel cyle reactors in construction out in the GOI desert and just this year 2024 China confirms that one of those reactors will start operating in 2025 that pilot plants will produce only about 2 megawatts of electricity when fully operational but because of the broader robustness of China's nuclear industry the act of building a working thorium reactor will probably be more challenging than simply proliferating them later on China hopes to eventually build numerous thoran plants across its

Landing aircraft powered by a modified Williams f17 turbo fan engine designated wr9 197 with some minor modifications because of its design the craft was dubbed the flying Pulpit it was designed to transport one operator and be controlled by leaning in the desired Direction while regulating engine output power it could move in any direction accelerate quickly hover and rotate on its axis as well as remain a loft for up to 45 minutes and travel at speeds of up to 60 MPH the United States Army evaluated it in the 1980s but it was deemed inferior to the the capabilities of helicopters and small uncrewed aircraft so the xjet program was halted 19 the radiant energy device Dr T Henry moay of Salt Lake City invented the first Gadget to extract energy from The Meta frequency oscillations of empty space in the early 1900s Mor was eventually able to create a free energy Gadget that weighed 60 lb and generated 50,000 watts of electricity for several hours ironically despite frequently demonstrating his Gadget to scient and Engineers Mor was unable to secure money to further develop the device into a usable Power Station capable of supplying electrical power on a large scale before World War II Mor worked briefly with the rural electrification Agency on the machine's development at the time the Rea was reportedly penetrated by communist supporters and high-ranking officers with a distinctly pinkish tint these officials repeatedly pressed Mor to pass over all details of his Gadget to the Soviet Union including arranging for highle Soviet scientists to visit the mo laboratory to view the device in action on the initiative of the Communist infiltrated Rea one person let us call him Z spent about 2 months in Mor's laboratory and managed to gain Mor's full confidence Mor eventually revealed most of the secrets of the manufacturer of his special valve to Z the only person in whom Mor had ever entirely confided there is considerable evidence that Z was a Soviet operative and that this was where the Soviets originally got the idea to construct the hyperspace amplifiers that would later be utilized in their psychotronic weapons thumbnail in our thumbnail we can see a scientist with his hands under a pyramid-shaped object which seems to be levitating due to the energy emitting from his hands is this real or trickery why don't you tell us what you think in the comments below 18 the hemp car in 1941 Henry Ford revealed his prototype for an automobile made almost completely of hemp the car was dubbed the hemp body car and was intended to be lightweight sturdy and inexpensive the car's body was composed of hemp fibers soybeans straw and resin with the chassis built of hemp and steel the automobile was a great accomplishment for its time and Ford was praised for his creative use of hemp Not only was the car almost entirely built of hemp but it also ran on hemp ethanol gasoline at the time ethanol was already a popular Automotive fuel but it was often derived from corn or sugar cane Ford on the other hand recognized the possibility of using hemp to produce ethanol fuel which he saw as a more sustainable and costeffective alternative to traditional fuels the car was also extremely efficient with a fuel efficiency rating of approximately 40 m per gallon which was remarkable given the level of automobile technology at the time furthermore the hemp bio composite body was Far lighter than steel which aided fuel economy unfortunately the usage of hemp ethanol fuel was never widely adopted due to political and economic constraints the oil industry and the government were not interested in encouraging the the adoption of a renewable fuel source that could endanger their Enterprises as a result the use of ethanol fuel made from hemp was heavily restricted and eventually fell out of use altogether 17 perpetual motion every firm has a narrative to tell including its Origins and the passion that drives it forward the vortex water Revitalize is more than a business it's a legacy of Victor schauberger's innovative ideas shurger was a pioneering Austrian Forester inventor and naturalist who dedicated his life to discovering the mysteries of water and its critical role in life conducting groundbreaking Research into living water and Vortex water filters he discovered a wealth of knowledge about water over the course of years of investigation and testing including its complicated structure and interactions with the surroundings his work continues to inspire scientists environmentalists and water conservationists as they strive to better understand and conserve this critical resource for future Generations 16 Coral Castle Coral Castle is is an oolite Limestone edifice designed by the lvan American eccentric Edward leedan it is situated in an unincorporated area of Miami Dade County in Florida between the communities of Homestead and Leisure City the structure is made up of multiple big Stones each weighing several tons and molded into different shapes such as slab walls tables chairs a crescent moon a water fountain and a Sund dial it is now a privately operated tourist attraction Coral Castle is famous for the story surrounding its construction which suggests Leeds colon created it single-handedly utilizing reverse magnetism or Supernatural skills to move and carve the stone 15 anti-gravity technology hidden in nature Victor stepanovich gof was a self-proclaimed Russian scientist biologist entomologist and paranormal researcher most known for claiming to have constructed a levitation platform powered by dead insect body parts attached to the underside gakov wrote extens ensive accounts of his flights over the Russian Countryside using his levitation apparatus these flying experiments as well as his purported sightings of other paranormal phenomena typically involving insect nests or parts were documented in his self-published book my world 14 cloudbuster a cloudbuster was a gadget invented by Austrian psychotherapist vilhelm Reich he claimed could cause Rain by controlling orgone energy in the atmosphere the cloudbuster was designed to be used in a similar manner as a lightning rod concentrating it on a spot in the sky and grounding it in a substance thought to absorb organ such as a body of water which would take orgone energy out of the atmosphere resulting in the development of clouds and Rain Reich conducted dozens of trials with the cloudbuster referring to his findings as Cosmic orgone engineering there have been no confirmed cases of a cloud Buster actually operating and creating significant weather change such as rain orgone therapy was always perceived as a pseudo science 13 General Motors ev1 the General Motors ev1 often known as the GM ev1 is a battery electric vehicle manufactured by the American automaker General Motors it was manufactured from 1996 until its demise in 1999 however the ev1 program ended 4 years later the General Motors ev1 a subcompact automobile represented the first mass-produced and purpose-built Battery electric vehicles the ev1 concept dates to 1990 when General Motors debuted the battery electric impact prototype which heavily influenced the design of the actual ev1 in 1990 the California air resources board issued a rule requiring the seven largest automakers in the United States to produce and sell zero emission vehicles to keep access to the California Market mass production began in 1996 in its early stages of manufacturing most of them were leased to customers in California Arizona and Georgia within a year of the ev1's day leasing programs were introduced in several other American states in 1998 General Motors introduced several modifications to the ev1 including a series hybrid a parallel hybrid a compressed natural gas variation and a four model vehicle all of which acted as prototypes for prospective future models despite positive customer feedback General Motors concluded that electric vehicles constituted an unproductive niche in the automotive business the business eventually crushed most of the cars and General Motors and ended the ev1 program in 2001 despite customer protests 12 project XA the story of Dr James D mold and his cancer-free cigarette should enrage every smoker and anybody who has lost a loved one because of tobacco smoking while there have always been rumors that tobacco corporations were dishonest about the health dangers of cigarette smoking the revelations of mold's pioneering work and how he was ignored emphasized the tobacco industry's avarice mold's pioneering effort on developing a new cigarette that did not cause cancer became known as project XA he had ligot support to design such a product and worked tirelessly with the ad little company on the task ahead after 25 years mold invented the XA or Palladium cigarette which used padium and magnesium nitrate to eliminate cancer-causing chemicals in cigarette smoke indeed in lab testing these cigarettes were found to be effective in reducing the incidence of cancer in lab animals despite the company's initial encouragement Executives withdrew their support for the initiative and the Palladium cigarette never reached production the fundamental reason for this was simple the company's lawyers warned that selling a safer product would result in unending lawsuits from the public for the less Safe products liot marketed 11 the Hendershot generator for more than 30 years Lester Hendershot worked on an overunity device that was expected to tap into a magnetic force field interestingly Hendershot appeared to be the only one capable to triggering it but he was unable to provide a satisfactory scientific explanation for why his invention functioned nonetheless the fuess generator was demonstrated numerous times between 1928 and 1960 and its reliability was confirmed by several witnesses including Charles Lindberg a demonstration was even given to the press in the United States and the equipment passed all assessment standards newspaper clippings demonstrate its Effectiveness however according to Bill Bey of keinet Hendershot encountered political issues when promoting his equipment attempted to expand his business to Mexico and eventually faded Into Obscurity 10 Nicola Tesla's wireless energy transmission Tesla was widely considered as America's best electrical engineer by 1900 having captivated the globe with his breakthrough Innovations and victory over Thomas Edison in the Battle of currents he then began his most ambitious project to date the warden Cliff transmission tower the warden Cliff facility built between 1901 and 1905 was based on another of Tesla's groundbreaking Concepts Tesla intended to use the tower to achieve what had previously been thought to be impossible a Global Wireless communication system the tower would be the prototype for a system that would use the Earth as a conductor to broadcast music news stock market reports secure military Communications and even fa simay images around the world it was an extremely foresighted attempt to build a telecommunications infrastructure comparable to what the internet provides today but entirely Wireless but Tesla had a far more ambitious plan for the huge Warden cliff Tower he had already demonstrated that highfrequency signals could be carried wirelessly using his own Tesla coil Transformers which led to what would become a lifelong Obsession Wireless energy transmission unfortunately Tesla's lofty ambition for Warden Cliffe outstripped his means and the patience of his sponsors the project fell into financial difficulties before completion and the unfinished Tower was finally dismantled in 1917 to satisfy Tesla's obligations what was once a renowned laboratory full of fantastic Tesla Innovations is now a desolate Memorial to his most ambitious idea nine Stan Meyer's water-powered car Stanley Allen Meyer designed a perpetual motion machine with a non-functional water fuel cell Meyer stated that an automobile equipped with the gadget might use water instead of gasoline Myers's claims regarding his water fuel cell and the car it powered were deemed fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996 Stanley Meyer died unexpectedly on March 20th 1998 while dining in a restaurant Meer brother reported Meyer abruptly went away during a meeting with two Belgian investors stating they had poisoned him following an investigation Grove City police concurred with the Franklin County Coroner's report that Meyer died of a brain aneurysm due to high blood pressure some Meyer fans believe he was slain to prevent the spread of his ideas Philipe van Morell one of the Belgian investors indicated that he had been financially supporting Meer for several years and regarded him as a personal friend and that he had no idea where the stories originated eight the tragic story of Royal Raymond re cancer cure Royal Raymond re was an American inventor and Pioneer of high magnification time-laps cinematography R is best known for his microscopes which he claimed could examine live microorganisms at magnifications previously thought unattainable as well as his oscillating Beam Ray Innovation which he said could treat a variety of maladies by devitalizing disease organisms using radio waves although he worked with Scientists doctors and inventors of the time and his findings were published in newspapers and scientific journals such as the Smithsonian Institute annual report of 1944 they were later rejected by the American Medical Association the American Cancer Society and mainstream science R proponents continue to believe that electromagnetic frequency shocks can destroy malignant cells and other disease-causing germs most of these claims are unsupported by scientific research and rif machines have not been certified for treatment by any health authorities worldwide multiple promoters have been convicted of Health fraud and sentenced to prison seven Thomas Townsen Brown electrogravitics Thomas Townsen Brown was an American inventor who believed he had developed a sort of anti-gravity induced by high electric Fields after doing study into unusual electrical phenomena instead of an anti-gravity Force what brown observed has typically been attributed to electrohydrodynamics the movement of charged particles that transfer their momentum to surrounding neutral particles in air often known as ionic drift or ionic wind for most of his life Brown worked to create gadgets based on his Concepts and promote them for use in business in the military the phenomenon became known as the beeld brown effect and electrogravitics Brown's findings inspired several amateur experimenters to create ionic propulsion lifters operated by high voltage there are still reports that brown found anti-gravity Which is popular Among The Unexplained flying object community and has spawned numerous conspiracy theories six Harry hoy's persecuted cancer treatment hoxy therapy also known as the hoxy method is an alternative medical treatment that claims to heal cancer the treatment comprises of acostic herbal paste for exterior cancers or an herbal mixture for internal cancers together with laxatives douches vitamin supplements and dietary modifications major medical agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute have found no proof that hoxy therapy is a successful cancer treatment on September 21st 1960 the FDA prohibited the sale and marketing of the hawy method in the United States labeling it a worthless and discredited cure and form of quackery the biomed Center in Tijuana Mexico is currently the primary marketer for the hawy method hawy therapy is also marketed over the internet in June 2008 the FDA National Health fraud coordinator stated that there was no scientific evidence and that it had no value in treating cancer yet consumers can go online right now and find all sorts of false claims that hoxy treatment is effective against the disease five the Feebas cartel and the birth of planned obsolescence between 1925 and 1939 the Feebas cartel was an international cartel that monopolized the production and distribution of incandescent light bulbs throughout Europe and North America the cartel seized over Market territory shortening the functional life of such bulbs on January 15th 1925 tongam oam enal electric Associated electrical Industries and Phillips Incorporated the cartel as Feebas PLC Industrial company for the development of lighting in Geneva although the organization intended for the cartel to continue 30 years it suspended operations in 1939 when World War 2 broke out following its breakup light bulbs continued to be sold with the cartel's 1,000 hour life standard in 1949 the United States district court for the District of New Jersey ruled that General Electric had violated the Sherman Antitrust act owing in part to its involvement in the Feebas cartel while acknowledging that it should be borne in mind that the life of a lamp is inextricably related to the power of its light the decision found that General Electric's dominant industry position and lack of competition gave it the power to determine bulb lifespan across the entire industry and that General Electric's primary consideration in setting bulb lifespans was profit the court considered this when deciding that General Electric had violated the act four lonus pauling's controversial vitamin C therapy lonus Carl Pauling was an American chemist biochemist chemical engineer Peace campaigner author and teacher Pauling was among the pioneers of quantum chemistry and molecular biology his contributions to chemical bond Theory include the concept of orbital hybridization as well as the first precise scale of Elemental Electro negativities in his later years he championed nuclear disarmament orthomolecular medicine Mega vitamin therapy and nutritional supplements particularly a corbic acid sometimes known as Vitamin C none of his claims about the medical benefits of huge dosages of vitamins have received WID spread recognition in the scientific Community three the cold fusion controversy and Eugene malive murder Eugene Franklin malv was an American physicist science writer editor and publisher of infinite energy magazine as well as the creator of the nonprofit new energy Foundation he was a proponent of cold fusion and its investigation as well as other experimental alter Al native energy subjects that are frequently referred to as fringe science malev wrote the book fire from Ice which details Stanley ponds and Martin Flan's 1989 report on tabletop cold fusion at the University of Utah among other things the book claims that the team produced greater than Unity output energy in an experiment that was successfully replicated several times but that the results were suppressed through an organized campaign of ridicule from mainstream physicists including those studying controlled thermonuclear Fusion to protect their their research and funding malev was killed in 2004 while clearing out his previous childhood house which had been rented three people were arrested and accused in connection with the incident two were convicted of first-degree manslaughter and murder while the third pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice two Paul Panton and GE technology Paul Panton created the well-known Global Environmental energy technology known as G according to many he was railroaded through a series of bizarre legal Maneuvers by powerful and corrupt conspirators into a state mental hospital in Provo Utah where he currently resides he's meant to be inept for saying that his system can fuel a car with primarily water and for not getting along with Utah code compliant sacked attorneys who betrayed him never mind the roughly 200 geek devices in the United States that are already running primarily on water in May 2009 a corrupt judge in Utah released Paul Panton from his illegal detention and he is now accessible to help researchers improve their GE application Paul Panton has made over 80 discoveries and is currently attempting to duplicate them for the benefit of the global scientific Community the topics covered span from GE to medical and natural issues Paul Panton has hundreds of other Innovations and is looking for someone to Market them one Rudolf Diesel and the diesel engine Rudolph diesel created numerous heat engines including a solar powerered air engine in 1892 he sought for a patent and was granted a development patent for his diesel engine Rudolph Diesel's Prime model a single 10t iron cylinder with a flywheel at its base powered itself for the first time on August 10th 1893 at Augsburg Germany that same year he was granted a patent for the engine as well as another for an improvement diesel spent two more years improving his model and in 1896 he exhibited another with a theoretical efficiency of 75% compared to the steam engines 10% efficiency and that of other early internal combustion engines work continued developing a production model in 1898 Rudolph diesel was granted US patent number 6884 for an internal combustion engine following his death diesel engines became widely used in automobiles trucks ships trains and other vehicles and they remain so today Modern Diesel engines are refined and enhanced versions of Rudolph Diesel's initial invention it's obvious that some of these inventions were blocked by greedy industrialists what is your take on this why don't you let us know in the comments below well that's it for now I hope you

positivity to our coverage I mean certainly we have a responsibility to acknowledge and educate about problems but we also want to highlight the good that's going to be hard today when we watched Intel's presentation on their new core Ultra 20000 desktop processors our first thought was boy do these ever look familiar and while we were impressed that AMD was able to achieve similar performance at significantly less wattage not many of you were Gamers don't want want 5% Improvement they want FPS and they want it now and well kind of kills me to have to be the one to tell you this but Arrow lake is more like arrow through the heart because you're not even going to get 5% at least not across the board the good news is that your power bill is going to go down but in many cases so will your performance so strap in for a very bumpy ride with me as I try to navigate what on Earth is going on with CPUs in 2024 but first a short layover to visit my aunt's Segway to our sponsor Ridge their magsafe wallets are back in stock it's the ridge wallet you know and love but this time it attaches to your phone crazy check it out in the link in the description and pick one up today AOL lake is full of changes some of which are pretty radical I mean for starters gone is smt or hyperthreading along with Intel's traditional monolithic die approach on the desktop instead we get a tile based architecture with the fos packaging that we first saw in meteor Lake and they're laying down clusters of skymont efficiency or ecor between our now single-threaded lion Cove performance or pees we also get four XE Graphics cores on the igpu tile that should be a lot stronger than Intel's previous attempts at integrated graphics and while it clearly isn't on the level of amd's 3D vcash chips they have upped the level two cach per piece core by 50% from two Megs to 3 Megs wow there's also been some big changes to core turbo Behavior more on that now you thought I was going to say later didn't you we've got two chips with us today the core Ultra 5 245k that's a 6p core 8 e core chip that boosts to 5.2 and 4.6 GHz respectively this is Intel's intended gamer sweet spot at least for now then we've got the core Ultra 9 285k that gets 8 p course and double the ecourse for a total of 24 cores this one should be the productivity and also just do anything monster it'll do 5.5 GHz on the P course and 4.6 on the eour at least it sort of will because the 285k has five yes five different boost frequencies depending on what you're doing it technically can actually turbo up to 5.7 GHz but that's only going to be a couple select cores in lightly threaded workloads all right thanks Intel as for the last CPU the one we don't have today it gets eight peores but only 12 ecores and a slightly slower clock speed so far so interesting but how's it going to play out for the folks shopping today we wanted to compare Intel's own last gen amd's ryzen 9000 and for the folks gaming on the top chips from the last couple of generations we included amd's most popular x3d chips a couple of important points though we decided to roll the latest Windows 11 24 H2 and our 96 and 9700x chips are tuned to the new 105 watt TDP that AMD unlocked last month and finally we didn't bother with the 5800 X 3D for productivity that's a gaming chip so with that in mind let's talk gaming performance all of our tests were run at 1080p low to all but eliminate GPU bottlenecks and put as much pressure on these CPUs as possible in City skylines 2 not only do we see a decent improvement over 14th gen in both averages and 1% lows but the 285k is beating everything in 1% low close the only problem is it's crushing our 245k as well it turns out in heavily multi-threaded games this current generation gaming chip is looking decidedly last gen it's not all bad news we found some generational uplift in Total War Warhammer 3 it's not much and also the 285k gets kind of stomped on by the 9700x in both averages and 1% lows with the 245k trailing right behind and that's it that's the positive news for gaming as we always say look to multiple sources to paint the most complete picture but for the rest of our suite the results are very disappointing shadow of the Tomb Raider has the 245k in last place clearly losing to its predecessor the 14600 K with the 285k not doing a whole lot better our x3d chips crush it in averages and even the vilified 9,000 Series chips from AMD come out ahead but AMD is far from Intel's only enemy here even Intel's own 14700 K is decently ahead of our new core Ultra 9 in average FPS fortunately that's not the case in rocket league but the 285k is still losing to its predecessor it seems that this game doesn't care much about 3D vcash but loves lots of cores and lots of threads and is the only game we tested that placed the 950x on top and it's bad news again for the 245k which found itself at the bottom of the list coming up short to the old Core 5 again both in averages and 1% lows yikes and in Red Dead Redemption we see another case where not only is AMD beating Intel into the ground but 14th gen is Right alongside getting in some kicks where it can and f123 doesn't look a whole lot better this is a massacre ladies and gentlemen I mean sure at least the 245k beat last gen in 1% lows but that's it and you know what else beats last gen our new community backpack it's got all the tech Forward Design you love from our OG backpack but in a smaller tighter package sign up for a notification at lm. g/c Commuter or at the link down below moving on to Counter Strike 2 both new chips are solidly in the bottom three with the 285k getting stomped yet again at least we see an improvement with the 245k and 1% lows cyberpunk sees both doing okay for averages but their abysmal 1% lows leave them buried at the bottom of the chart not only being bested by their own previous generation but also a 2-year-old AMD chip running in an 8-year-old socket truly this is a sad day for gaming and therefore the world or is it we asked Intel to tell us their top two and bottom two games that showcased their new power efficiency gains and we tested them ourselves with the 285k and while it's clear you're going to see some huge swings in performance depending on what you play with these new Chips it is equally clear that you're going to see a reduction in power consumption across the board something that Intel unlike AMD really needed to get under control with this generation we'll touch a bit more on Power and thermals later but you can see here that yes in Final Fantasy 14 Dawn tril we're losing 20% of our performance but we're also dropping 40% of our power consumption and Hitman that was a similar story with a 45% decrease in power for only a 133% loss in fps and those are the worst two what about the best in 6 we've got a 35% power reduction while gaining almost 9% performance on the turn timer and in f123 nearly 40% less power with 12% more average FPS don't get me wrong Guys these are truly small slivers of silver on some very large cumulon nimbus clouds but they are there this justtin Intel has informed us that despite claims of APO or application optimization being enabled by default on AOL Lake it was in fact off on the motherboard they sent us for our review we've rerun the tests and discovered a small frame rate increase in CS2 essentially no change whatsoever in Shadow of the Tomb Raider and a decrease of about 10% in Red Dead Redemption 2's 1% lows the rest of our games only saw a 1 to 2% change which could be attributed to run variants some of our productivity scores even went down slightly with the feature enabled for the record APO should be enabled by default on all boards either in time for launch or shortly thereafter I can't believe I'm still doing this character it also appears that Windows 1124 H2 can have lower performance in games compared to other windows versions this is the version our testing used but since 24 H2 is publicly available you may even be using it right now we're standing by our results if you want to learn more about the wide variety of performance you can expect depending on which versions of Windows you're running check out Hardware unbox coverage as they tested the 285k on multiple windows versions and power modes showing some pretty big changes in fps your mileage may vary we're still not impressed with aake when it comes to gaming back to you [Music] lonus I don't expect almost any gamer to look at this and think I am very compelled to buy this product but what I can hope is that like we saw with AMD Zen one that maybe this is the start of a long journey to recovery for Intel because if they can figure out what's going on with the games where they're getting absolutely dumpstered productivity looks pretty okay in blender there's a solid decrease in time taken to render for the 285k against the 14900 K and we get about a 10% Improvement between the core fives as well unfortunately for Intel the 950x is still on top but considering that the 245k Beats both the 9700x and 9600 X I'm seeing this as a bright spot for Intel a surprising one given the lack of hyp threading on this new generation compiling with gdau sees more improvements for a lake 2 with our 245k once again beating the AMD 9700x it may only have six peores but those ecores are really starting to show their strength now that we see them do more heavy lifting in multi-threaded workloads Intel has really invested in making these new skymont eor beefy to the point where they're really more like underclocked Raptor Cove PE course in handbreak we see more improvements in av1 encoding the coral Ultra 9 sees a 22% uplift over last gen with about a 15% uplift for the core Ultra 5 neither of them can crack the Behemoth that is the 32 thread 950x but it is nice to see that the 245k isn't completely useless trailing just behind the 9700x x264 encoding is a similar story with smaller gains over previous gen on both chips but hey now our 245k is beating the 9700x by a hair and we see very similar results in Prime seeve with our 285k in second place place and the 245k admirably beating its 9600 X counterpart especially interesting in our results is cinebench the 285k finally lands on top of a chart in multicore and both a lake chips comfortably beat their 14th gen counterparts the lack of pee multi-threading and the extra ecore clusters really hurt the accor Ultra 5 but at least in single core it puts on a respectable show trailing just behind the 14900 K just like in games though the story here heavily depends on the workload and we got just abysmal results in Puget bench's photoshop with both new Chips performing worse than last gen and straggling behind AMD by a wide margin in Premier Intel is better than AMD but this was already their fight to lose and unfortunately they managed it aerol Lake doesn't even manage to beat their last gen 14th Gen processor so pic Victory and seven zip is another disappointing loss in both compression and de compression wamp wamp can we maybe find some more silver how about AI I mean after all unlike amd's most recent desktop offerings these new Intel chips have npus oo neural processing and at least when it comes to open voo we really see them shine with our 285k netting an 82% increase over the 14900 K CPU score in the same test and since our 245k has the same npu tile it gets nearly the same score there as well walloping the 14600 K here we start to see what all the fuss is about with Intel's new igpu as well those four XC cores are putting in work with more than double the performance of last gen unfortunately AMD CPUs don't support open Veno they use Windows ML and in that race they beat Intel's CPU scores however in most cases on Intel you won't be using Windows ml so depending on your use case these new npus might really matter to you because I don't know you can afford a brand new CP and motherboard but not a GPU I don't know we'll have to see how developers use these things what could actually be a factor for you is power while our 285k peaked at 250 watts to top the charts earlier it only averaged 218 which is a 303 wat drop from the 14900 K to be clear Intel is still clearly juicing their chips harder than AMD but at least it's finally coming down and it looks even better when we compare our 245k to the 14600 k okay less power higher score you'll love to see it it's just too bad that AMD Twisted the knife on their most recent launch it's also just not that clear of an improvement we looked at Intel's best case for performance per wat in gaming earlier but in our usual process for power and thermal testing we use f123 and gen over gen it's more of a mixed bag here yeah they're using fewer Watts on both SKS but surprisingly they're running a few hotter so it looks like unless they're using significantly less power you can expect a pretty similar operating temperature but hey at least you can reuse your old cooler with the new LGA 1851 socket oh yeah I only briefly mentioned this before if you want these new Chips you're going to need a new motherboard sick truly guys I don't remember the last launch that left me this disappointed I mean there is a ton of cool stuff here to get excited about like the potential prediction Improvement thanks to removing smt and the new knobs and dials for overclocking leaks have even popped up showing the 285k reaching over 350 Watts for an alleged 82% performance gain it's just too bad that the majority of you guys watching this video are probably never going to try your hand at overclocking Beyond enabling XMP on your RAM anyway speaking of ram big changes there we're getting CU dim support and a ddr5 only memory controller Intel told us that these CPUs should see some decent game gains when cranking up the speed to 8,000 megat transfers per second or greater which sounds pretty cool except that ours completely refused to do it so we weren't able to verify their claims stay tuned though maybe now that both AMD and Intel have settled on ddr5 we'll have to test a wide range of memory speeds on both Platforms in the not too distant future maybe an update or two in the meantime will fix Intel's issues in time for that which leaves us with one last kick in the teeth when we started writing this review the ryzen 9 950x was scarce and prices were high but as of the weekend before the Embargo lift the 950x went on sale for as low as $599 that didn't last long and at the time of filming they're already back to the $700 range but it's a good way to get us started on the conversation about pricing today you can buy a core Ultra 9 285k for $589 you're also going to need a new motherboard that supports the new 1851 socket and realistically probably some new ddr5 memory if you want to try to get faster speeds out of it the ultra 7 265k probably the chip that actually matters in this launch and unfortunately the one we have zero benchmarks for it costs almost 200 bucks less at 3.94 and the Ultra 5 245k is 309 considering that Arrow Lake isn't a drop in replacement it is really hard to get excited about this pricing when we look at the competition especially when we consider that the ryzen 7 9800 x3d is rumored to be released next month Intel's calling AOL Lake a reset on the desktop road map and I guess I'm just hoping that that's true and that this is a Zen one moment like that was a major change with some real improvements but it wasn't that competitive the real competitiveness came later with Zen 2 and especially Zen 3 so for Intel right now unless you're super keen on an npu on desktop or you're one of those people who still thinks that AMD is Kirkland brand Intel it's really hard for me to find a reason to buy these if you do want to pick one up we'll have it and all the CPUs that we tested Linked In the description down below

of money in a predictable career you needed a   nice suit and an important looking business card 
your options were Finance medicine law or senior   company management if you were lucky but then just 
a few years later at around the same time as those   people in fancy suits were blowing up the global 
economy a new breed of millionaire was entering   the mainstream they replaced their puffer vests 
in Bloomberg terminals with flip-flops and Vim   terminals Tech Bros worked fewer hours had better 
perks and many cases made better money than their   peers in more traditional High income roles 
what's more is that people didn't hate them   Executives bankers and their fancy lawyers were 
blamed for enriching themselves by leeching off   a broken system that cost people their homes their 
jobs and their Futures meanwhile people Love the   idea of hacky sack playing nerds making millions 
by actually making stuff that improved our lives   but now 15 years later the tech Bros became 
everything they promised to destroy and they   kind of destroyed themselves in the process new 
reporting indicates that Facebook is planning a   new system to track users data even as they leave 
the site with a revolutionary new product what was   your vision well computer on lay off up to 10,000 
workers there's Larry CEO of Google say something   on hi at their Peak Tech Bros enjoyed endless 
career progression opportunities options packages   that can make the multi-millionaires before they 
were 30 a good work life balance and the promise   that if they knew how to code they would always 
be guaranteed guaranteed a good job today they   are being forced back into the overpriced cities 
that don't want them there they are being laid off   in mass and the ones that remain are being told 
to grind and they have apparently made programs   so good that their CEOs are gleefully talking 
about a future where entry-level programmers   are completely replaced by AI between the Golden 
Age and the dark ages of tech Bros there have been   three major changes that both caused their massive 
rise and their current fall the first problem was   that they simply ran themselves out of business 
on Friday the 10th of March in the year 2000   the NASDAQ hit its then all time Peak investors 
were all in on companies that were ready to take   advantage of the internet and the speculative 
Mania was so Fierce that just the mention of   do com and their company filings was enough to 
send their stock price soaring eventually this   all collapsed and only a select few companies from 
that era have survived to this day the reality was   that the internet was an amazing technology that 
would go on to change our lives and facilitate   some of the most valuable companies in history but 
just putting a normal business on a website wasn't   actually revolutionary what came after was a 
genuine Golden Era of tech services the companies   that survived the Doom bubble were actually useful 
and the cleansing of the market meant that more   talent and investment could go towards supporting 
companies that actually did provide a good service   early YouTube Myspace Facebook Amazon and online 
gaming were all novel and genuinely great services   that if you are as old as me you probably remember 
finding them absolutely amazing there was still   money flowing into them and the tech sector wrote 
out the global financial crisis better than most   the first iPhone was released in 2007 and even at 
the height of layoffs in corporate bankruptcies   in 2008 people were still lined up around the 
block to buy the iPhone 3G you were told that   if you learned how to code you would be sure of a 
good job and at the same time companies like Apple   and Google were being named as the most desirable 
places to work thanks to their relaxed corporate   attitude excellent work life balance amazing 
employee perks and surprisingly competitive   salaries most importantly these companies were 
still not the establishment they were Scrappy   startups making products that people actually 
enjoyed after theom crash it took the NASDAQ   over 15 years to recover from its previous Peak 
this meant that thanks to employee stock options   these mid-2000s Tech Bros were making good money 
but they would likely still be out earned by their   Finance bro peers assuming they weren't laid 
off in 2008 that slowly changed though and as   these companies grew more money flowed into the 
industry and with more money came more workers   bigger bonuses stock options and it went from 
an alternative industry filled with Nerds making   products that people enjoyed to the industry 
making products that would secure funding from   a growing pool of investors they went from the 
business of adding value through technology to   extracting value through monopolies for a while 
you could have a great degree of confidence in   becoming Filthy Rich by putting in a few years 
at a major Silicon Valley tech company but all   this relied on a stream of money that wasn't 
coming from nowhere Venture Capital the firms   that actually invest in early stage startups to 
develop their new technology never again actually   reached the level of funding it did during the 
do com bubble that was until something changed   in 2021 so it's time to learn how money Works to

the rush to hire more Talent heated up by the   mid-2010s if you had a talented developer you 
could easily out earn any other career out of   college by working for a company like Facebook 
Apple Amazon Netflix or Google the so-called Fang   companies these businesses all had established 
platforms but they still hired tens of thousands   of developers and paid them very well for a few 
reasons the first was that they were constantly   trying to add new features to their core offerings 
and even maintaining a platform like YouTube takes   a lot of work to keep up to date with customer 
demands the homepage of the site today looks   very different from even 5 years ago there was 
also an exuberance where newer companies like   uber Airbnb twitch Snapchat Tinder and even 
wework were scaling their operation so fast   that they would hire developers before they even 
had a defined project for them to work on because   hiring when they actually needed staff would 
slow them down this was part of a relatively   new tech industry strategy called Blitz scaling 
a not so subtle reference to the blitz Greg of   World War II which was all about capturing as much 
territory as possible as quickly as possible using   new technology before the enemies could respond 
supply lines couldn't keep up but the Hope was   that once a territory was captured the German Army 
could sort all of that out later now clearly tech   companies are not rolling tanks through Belgium 
but they are using the scalability of technology   to capture market share in Industries like food 
delivery taxis holiday rentals and online dating   as quickly as possible and then sorting out things 
like what to do with all their staff later on in   an interview published by the Harvard Business 
Review Reed Hoffman a Silicon Valley venture   capitalist and one of the founders of PayPal 
and Linkedin said that companies that are Blitz   scaling may need to get as many Warm Bodies to 
the door as possible as quickly as you can another   reason why Tech Bros are being hired as quickly 
as possible was that hiring lots of staff was a   great way to make sure that they couldn't go to 
potential competitors especially startups that   could and I I really hate to say this but disrupt 
the industries of the big incumbent players   acquiring competitor companies as they start to 
take market share could get companies in trouble   with the FTC for anti-competitive practices but 
there were no rules against denying them to staff   that they would need to get their business going 
in the first place a report by The Wall Street   Journal interviewed Tech workers who admitted 
to being hired to do nothing at all and that the   businesses were hoarding developers like Pokémon 
cards that made it all worse when high interest   rates reduce Market certainty and lower customer 
demand for a lot of these Tech products resulted   in Mass offs across the industry businesses 
that were Blitz scaling either shut down or   shifted gears to only hire workers they really 
actually needed new feature development slowed   down and big established companies didn't need 
to worry about hoarding workers away from their   competitors anymore because nobody was hiring 
artificial intelligence is also already doing   a lot of the grunt work that is typically given 
to new employees tech companies by their nature   are more open to adopting these new technologies 
and even replacing just a handful of entry-level   developers can save companies millions of dollars 
every year so it really is an ideal environment   for automation this was the second major blow to 
the tech Bros they traded in the promise of a very   stable career for something that has become an 
incredibly risky game of survival you can make   a lot of money and Technology but your success is 
going to depend just as much on picking the right   company or startup at the right time toest in as 
it is on your own personal skills development an   entry-level developer that started working with 
Intel 5 years ago had a good chance of being laid   off last month with stock options that are worth 
absolutely nothing a a similarly skilled developer   that took a job with Nvidia at the same time on 
the other hand probably never needs to work again   in their life the ones that got lucky go out and 
the ones that got let go are sick of playing the   stock market with their careers if they wanted 
to do that they would have become Finance Bros   and then there is the biggest problem of all 
workers want to be close to job opportunities   and companies want to be close to workers so the 
whole industry has aerated in just a handful of   locations these cities have become incredibly 
expensive and infrastructure has not been able   to scale as fast as these companies which means 
it's not unusual for Tech workers making six   figures to share a two-bedroom apartment with 
three other highly paid local workers ask me   how I know if you are a tech worker struggling 
to afford a place to live on a six figure salary   then there is basically no hope for other workers 
in these cities which are still essential to keep   Society functioning as a result big Tech cities 
have not only become expensive places to live   they've also become not particularly nice places 
to live remote work could have alleviated these   issues by easing demand in these small markets 
but the big tech companies now have a lot more   negotiating power over workers who don't want to 
be another layoff statistic and they are using   that power to mandate a return to office even Zoom 
the company developing remote Working Solutions   has pulled its teams back into the office these 
problems also don't come with many upsides for   locals the big sell is that these companies 
offer great jobs but most of these jobs go to   people who were not local and only move to the 
city after they secure a role and then compete   with locals for housing and other services says 
I personally moved to San Francisco from out of   state after I got a job at an investment bank so 
even though I was technically a finance bro I was   still very much a part of the problem other areas 
have gone from welcoming tech companies opening   up operations in their cities to actively pushing 
back against it and this all represents a trend   which is way larger than just gentrifying entire 
cities people just straight up don't like the tech   industry anymore whether they are pressing them 
out of their homes collecting their data hitting   them with declining Services making them piss 
and B models or threatening their jobs with AI   most people don't see this as progress anymore 
and the tech Bros have become just as unpopular   as us Finance Bros these companies have also 
bent the rules in their favor to make their   particular brand of Market power technically 
legal go and watch my video on why everything   is a monopoly again to find out more of the 
tricks they have used to make that possible   now I will be writing an article about why some 
Silicon Valley Elites want to build a new city   outside of San Francisco so if you want to

No gap now Neatening up thatch which would stick out annoyingly Sweeping floor Grading dirt floor as flat as possible for roof tile drying area A wallaby eating grass as is their custom A tile mold of cane and a tile form of wood are fetched to make tiles at the new shelter Area is cleared for a slaking pit to wet and mix clay Water is put in the pit to make mud Mud is used to make a flat table top to form tiles on The table needs to be slightly higher than the surrounding ground so the tile can be slid off and onto the tile form  A water rat being a rat in water This will be the source of the clay for the tiles, it's suitably more dense and plastic compared to normal mud The clay is dugout by hammering in wooden stakes and levering out the clay 25 pots of clay were added to the pit This was slaked with water It was trodden on to get rid of any dry bits A large stone was selected as a place to crush grog to temper the clay. I intend to keep using it until eventually it is bowl shaped to form a mortar A large constrictor keeps warm in a hollow tree Later when it woke up and stretched out it was about 3 m long Old broken roof tiles from a previous project The old tiles are crushed to form  a powder (called grog) which when mixed with new clay, prevents it from cracking during drying and firing The clay is taken from the pit and mixed with the grog It just needs enough so the clay is gritty 12.5 cm cubes (measure with fingers) are enough to make one tile The shelter does it's job of keeping the rain off the work The table is dusted with dry dirt so the clay won't stick to it The clay is then pressed flat into the cane mold (50 cm long, 20 cm wide to 15 cm wide) The tile is smoothed with water It is then shifted onto the curved wooden tile form and the mold is removed The form and tile are then taken to the drying area The tile has it's sides slightly pressed onto the ground so that it won't silp over when the form is pulled out The form is then pulled out leaving the curved clay tile to stand on it's own A row of 22 roof tile were made Another row of 22 tiles were made for a total of 44 tiles More clay Note the shelter is a essential for keeping the tiles dry before firing 88 tiles 132 tiles Rat footprints make an interesting tile decoration that could last 1000s of years A skink finds suitable (but temporary) accommodation under a roof tile Mud is formed into a flat stable base for the site of a kiln which will fire the tiles Bricks made in previous videos are taken to the site of the kiln 4 rows of 3 bricks laid on their sides are made for the first layer of the kiln Then 4 rows of bricks are laid on the first layer  This forms the ash pit and firebox layers The walls of the kiln are then built up with bricks on their sides in layers of 10.  Bricks are laid on their sides because they are less likely to crack this way and it uses fewer bricks Only when bricks are laid firmly bedded in mortar will they not crack when laid flat Finished kiln Hammering in stakes to hold the wood pile (1 m high stakes in a 75 cm square) Dry sticks are broken to 75 cm lengths (the length of the kiln firebox) Wood is stacked neatly in a pile next to the kiln 75 x 75 x 100 cm pile of wood is more than enough for one firing for this sized kiln Fire by friction The fire helps dry the tiles Unfired bricks are taken from another hut to act as the grate in the kiln These bricks will act as a grate holding the tiles above the flames while also being fired in the process 12 bricks in a 50 x 50 cm ware chamber Fire is taken to the kiln Tiles are taken to the kin The tiles are staked in the kiln in 3 rows with one row pointing down and two rows pointing up (the tapered tiles fit better this way) The fire is just drying the tiles at this stage. The clay must be bone dry before firing to avoid steam explosions and spalling of the tiles I fit 42 tiles in this batch but it can hold a maximum of 45 seen as in later firings Mud is used to plaster the kiln to stop air getting in This should stop cold air getting in and slowing the firring process Stoking a drying fire in the lower ash pit  The tiles are covered with old broken tiles to keep the heat in, re-radiating it back onto the tiles bellow Wood is put through the upper firing ports to begin the proper firing These are lit with a fire from beneath in the ash pit The wood in the upper firing ports catches fire and starts burning properly The wood is raised up on bricks so that air can get underneath and then up through the wood for better combustion About an hour in and unburnt gases combust above the kiln in a fireball Coals are raked out from the ashpit sometimes if they clog the air flow When the tiles turn glow red they should be fired and will not dissolve in water The next day the tiles are taken out The nice sound indicates the tiles were fired well There is a slight sheen on the clay indicating a bit of an ash glaze due to a high temperature The tiles are put into water to test that they are water proof. Better they dissolve now then later in the roof of a hut from rain Here are the bricks that were fired in the kiln. 2 broke this time due to the heat and weight of the tiles They are crushed into grog for the next batch of tiles The other bricks are water tested as well The bricks survived a few hours in water, passing the test They are stacked in a pile next to the hut The roof tiles also passed the water test These are laid against the bricks in 3 neat rows The next batch of bricks  The next batch of tiles This time a roof of tile is placed on the kiln to shelter it from rain before it is fired With enough wood collected the next firing can begin The roof is removed This simple updraft kiln is producing surprisingly high temperature as evidenced by a black mineral melting out of the clay This tile in the center of the kiln actually started to soften and bend in the heat Wood ash from the firings is sifted and formed into bricks for storage, The ash can be calcined to make a cement in future projects A small bowl is made for the firing as well. I keep losing them as I leave them in the creek as scoops for iron bacteria and they get washed away in floods The pot goes on top of the tiles and is covered in pot sherds Burning march flies as punishment for biting The pot is glowing orange Fired pot Nice ring indicates the pot is well fired (hollow sound would indicate a crack) 2 tiles and one brick broke this time The ash bricks are stored in the brick hut until they are ready to be turned into cement 1 month in and the next round of tile making begins by taking unused clay to the pit Scrap clay from another hut is also taken to the pit for slaking More raw clay is also mined  I'm testing some soil for bricks to see if it's suitable A basin is dug to soak the brick mold in A wet mold helps the clay bricks slip out more easily 2 rows 4 m long= 50 bricks The unfired bricks and tiles are stacked up to dry quicker While they dry, the site for the hut is prepared 2 foundation trenches 2 m long x 25cm wide and 25 cm deep are dug 2 m apart Water is poured in to help soften the soil for digging Stone rubble is put in the trenches to allow water to drain out Drains extend out to let the water flow A foundation stone is placed onto the rubble to form a base to build the mud wall on Foundation stones laid onto rubble Foundations complete Water to soften soil for digging Soil is dug and mixed with water to form mud The mud is placed in a layer on top of the stone foundation about 25 cm wide and 5 cm thick The same is done with the other foundation About 2 layers a day could be added without the wall slumping The walls had to be covered with bricks and tiles during construction to prevent rain from dissolving the work The tiles effectively sheltered the walls from the rain When the rain events eased, wall building could continue The digging was hard on the hands with nails wearing down and bleeding from mixing the sandy soil This can be avoided by simply having more rest days but the wet season was coming so work had to continue After reaching a height of 1.25 m the gabled portion was begun 4 stepped portions of wall decreasing by 25 cm from the ends formed a roughly 30 degree angle gable  An estimated 1.25 to 1.6 tons of soil went into making the two walls, taking about 2 weeks to build with a few digging sticks and a clay water pot A seedling germinates in the still wet mud wall Cutting wood for the roof with a stone axe The pole is cut to 3 m long so it will jut out 25 cm from the end of each wall  10 such poles were laid on the gables to form the roof To stop the logs rolling, they were mortared in place with mud Tiles were immediately put in place over the gables to protect the mud walls from rain  Rows of tiles with concave faces up and narrow ends pointing down hill are laid next to each other Then tiles with concave faces down and narrow ends pointing up hill are placed on top of the rows below to cover the gap between the rows Finally cap tiles cover the gap in the ridge at the top of the roof With the tiles finally dry, they can now be fired These are the test bricks made from new soil Here I fit 45 tiles into a single batch Fire by friction The next batch go straight on the roof Bricks made from the new soil are no good, it's weak and breaks easily when fired A mouse and it's pups are evicted from their nest in the tiles The radiant heat from the kiln is uncomfortable. Water is splashed on the face and hands as coolant during stoking One more batch to go and I'm hoping it will just be enough to finish the roof After rain, the effectiveness of the roof is apparent between the covered and uncovered portions of floor The tiles are tediously placed to finish the roof The last tile is put in place by being pushed up with a stick The 2 wall tiled hut is finally complete after  two and a half months of work, just in time for the wet season Natures Bureau of Meteorology forecasts rain  Some water at the end of the wall A drainage trench is dug to drain water away from the shelter First fire in the new hut Two walled tiled hut"

from the prince of Zamunda saying that you've inherited vast wealth if only you provide to them your various details clearly this is just a piece of junk mail right well not exactly there are actually several secret messages hidden here and no I don't mean that there's some code mixed into the text the text is 100% normal the message is just so tiny that even looking right at it you wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there in advance here watch this this is where our first secret message is hidden and even if I Circle it you still can't see it but if I use some scissors to cut this little section out and then float the piece of paper in a little bit of water you'll see the message start to reveal itself the paper will swell and sink but a tiny little black dot of material remains let's take this little chunk and stick it under the microscope when we do and zoom in suddenly we see our first secret message this is called micro dot it's a piece of spy technology that has actually been in use for more than a 100 years and was used extensively during the Cold War instead of a microscope a spy would carry with them a special tiny lens for viewing micro dots so that any communication they received could be viewed then at some point they would be sent material that seems inert a magazine a letter maybe a piece of clothing or a hat just like a piece of junk mail and somewhere in that material one or more micro dots would be hidden and they would be told in advance where to look then they need only extract it view it and then either hide the dot or dispose of it and to anyone else unless they knew exactly where to look they would never find the message making it incredibly secure and this worked in Reverse to spies would be given special cameras that could take pictures of classified documents and convert them to micro dots that could be sent back to their handlers these tiny cameras could be small enough to fit in a matchbox or even be disguised as a pen with the Advent of the internet I think we've maybe gotten a little bit too comfortable with the ease at which we can share and save information especially encrypted information that no one's snooping could decipher but for a spy during the Cold War passing information was not only a lot harder a mistake often meant it would cost your life and everything you touch or bring home can and probably would get picked over by Counter Intelligence Services either before you get it or while you're not home micro dots were one of the ways this problem was addressed they could be hidden in plain sight like the example you just saw but you don't necessarily need to hide the dots on the page here's a few hidden under the stamp for example or could be a laminated postcard with dots embedded in the core of the paper and you need to pry it apart to get at the dots the examples were pretty much endless and limited only by creativity the beauty of micro dots is that you can cram an insane amount of information into a tiny space without the need for any Electronics so during the first world war carrier pigeons would be loaded with micro dots because that way you could pack more information into the carrying tube of the bird and during the second world war as well they were used for secure Communications and Espionage though I think with fewer pigeons so how do you make a micro dot well it turns out it's both easier than you might think and yet also harder in other ways if you don't know some of the tricks today we're going to go through the whole process and unlike most of the other projects we've done lately this is absolutely one you can try yourself and it's honestly really fun though if you're younger you're going to need your parents supervision as it does involve using some simple chemical Solutions if you're a child of the '90s or older you've almost certainly at some point held the material used to make a micro Dot and it's this stuff film negatives when you take a picture with old school film you are essentially taking a room sized image and shrinking it down to 35 mm thing is this ability to take an image and shrink it down was noticed literally since photography was first invented even deera types which are one of the oldest types of photo that were taken on polished sheets of silver metal had people using lenses to project tiny images onto the plates to make tiny little pictures in fact if you've ever spent any time in a reference library you might have had a chance to handle this stuff which is called micro fish it's basically just photographic film but instead of taking images of a pretty sunset you find everything from copies of old newspapers to manuals of obscure machines and pretty much any reference material you can think of micro f is incredibly stable and because of how tiny everything is it's also incredibly information dense before the Advent of computers and the internet microfish was a way to store an immense amount of data in almost every Library let me show you just how good a standard piece of film is this is the US AF resolution test pattern you can see that it gets smaller in increments and is the perfect pattern for testing things like this I printed it out on a normal piece of paper and set it up on a wall in a very well-lit area on a white background to actually shoot this I'm using an old Nikon em SLR 35mm camera you don't need this model we just happen to find this Beauty on Facebook Marketplace for like 80 bucks which was an absolute steal and needing to buy it for this project has 100% started a film addiction I fully intend on enjoying once I'm done editing this video anyway I started by loading up a roll of film and got set up to take the picture now one downside to this process is that unlike a modern digital camera the only way you know if your pictures look right is to develop them which means using a whole roll of film each time to test your development settings and camera settings I ruined a lot of film both in the photo taking part of this project and the development steps we'll get to later I also ruined film in many different exciting ways including forgetting to engage various parts of the camera or loading the film incorrectly as I was learning how to do everything so be prepared to do this a bunch of times if you're new to this but film is cheap and the whole process is super fun so stick with it till you get it anyway I'm going to skip all the other photos I took for now and the development process and let's just have a look at the resolution test pattern here it is under the microscope and to give you a sense of scale here is a quarter sitting next to the image you can see though that as we get to the smaller details we start to see a sort of blurring effect because of something called grain when I move the film a little bit you can see the grain is an intrinsic part of the image the reason for this grain is because of how this film works the photosensitive material in normal 35mm film is AAL silver-based salt usually silver chloride or iodide when a crystal of these silver chemicals are exposed to light the halide ion pops off and the Crystal is reduced to Tiny grains of metallic silver then in the development process those grains are turned black this means that the detail you can capture is directly related to how tiny the grains in your film are in general the higher or larger the iso rating number the larger the grains because a big grain will react faster than a small one but you lose more and more resolution as you increase the grain size this is why I've been using ISO 50 film for these experiments but if you're a spy this is not an acceptable limitation when every letter needs to be perfect and you want the dots to be as small as possible you can't get stuck being limited by silver crystals so most spy agencies had special film made that didn't use silver as the main ingredient instead they used photosensitive organic polymers which are perfectly smooth films of sensitive material that have no grain structure this is actually very similar to the sorts of materials used in the manufacturer of computer chips in order to make computer chips or pcbs you use something called photo resist basically you shine your pattern onto the photo resist and wherever the light hits it it becomes chemically resistant and solid so that way when you develop the resist all the stuff that didn't get hit with light washes away exposing the bare metal or silicone Below in all likelihood the CIA probably worked with a company like Kodak to develop special roles of film with a photo resist like material instead of silver so they could load all their special spy cameras and send messages to their agents though what they used or who they worked with to develop it I have no idea there are actually some commercial products that are probably close like this mini copy film from Fujifilm which is ISO 6 Beyond The Grain structure we're also running into issues of optical quality while this camera is great it's not exactly spy grade so the Optics aren't doing us any favors the stuff used by spy a gencies would only be the best of the best if they expected it to work properly and make truly tiny dots we're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best sir thing is you don't need to be a spy to care about the security of your Communications in our modern world of digital communication it's actually easier than ever to spy on your activity every time you use the internet you leave a very loud trail that all sorts of Nero Wells and nosy organizations can keep track of and sometimes parts of the internet get locked behind a geolocation wall where you can't access content because you happen to be standing on the wrong spot on earth at the time enter the sponsor of this video nordvpn you can think of a VPN sort of like the carrier pigeons of old it takes the message you want to send and securely moves it to another location before it is read so no one snooping knows where the message is going or what's inside all you have to do is install their super easy to use app and press go or choose from one of their many servers all around the world the way this works is on your end you just use the internet like normal but instead of directly connecting to whatever website you actually want the app encrypts and routes your traffic first through Nord servers before sending it on to wherever it needs to go this way anyone snooping can't tell what you're actually connecting to as all they can see is your connection to Nord and if you ever get stuck on geolock content you can just pick a server in that country so the site doesn't know that you're actually far away so if you'd like to upgrade your internet security and make sure that no one snooping can see what you're up to head to nordvpn.com sthot Emporium today for the incredibly low price of only 333

thorium to snag this amazing deal all right that's enough yammering let's make some micro dots since the film negative is going to be the micro dot if you want want black text on the final micro dot we need white letters on a black background to take a picture of and since we're using normal film there will be a limit to how small we can make things while I was racking my brain to think of what it'd be fun to shrink down I figured out that if you take the Dr Seuss book The Lorax and remove all the pictures it works out to approximately three or four pages so I made a few images in Photoshop of the text on a black background and then printed them out to maximize the contrast I used one of our soft boxes as a backlight and then put the printed pattern on top I used the maximum aperture and took pictures at different distances making sure to get the focus as perfect as physically possible and for comparison I also took some images where the paper was just very well lit from the front to see if that made a difference now there's space for 36 images on a roll of film and after using about half the rooll on micro dot things I switched to some more interesting images through this whole video longtime viewers have probably been wondering Justin this is cool and all but where are the Horrors you haven't turned anything into meat or made an inanimate object sentient or shown the rules of the universe being bent in a funny way why are you really interested in this well dear viewer the answer is of course because there is 100% an ulterior motive to pursuing this project this ability to shrink down patterns is really handy Not Just for information storage but also for making special Optical elements here let me show you this is literally just a printed picture of a pattern of lines which at this scale has no special property properties but when we shrink it down using this camera technique suddenly that pattern of lines gains special abilities now it's become a defraction grading if I put it in front of a point source of white light and look through it with a camera you can see it now takes a spot of light and splits it into a rainbow and this isn't just a quirk of developed film a blank piece doesn't do this and one of our regular patterns doesn't do this either it has to be the very specific defraction grading pattern I'm not going to get into this part of the project much more today but while I was shooting the micro dos I've also been calibrating various other patterns some will behave like lenses some should form Holograms or twist and bend light into incredibly weird ways in the next video that'll be out in a couple of weeks we're going to be doing a deep dive into these effects and all the Myriad of ways you can mess with light by just shining it through the right pattern but before I could do that I needed to get the development process perfect so we can turn the fresh negatives into either the final patterns or micro dots to do that we need a few things I'm using these Auto feeder reels and this development tank and to get the film safely out of the canister and loaded into the tank I'm using this cheap dark room bag this isn't necessary you can just do the loading in a pitch black room but this bag is nice if you don't have a room in your house that is dark enough basically you load your development tank your film and something to open the canister into the bag then you zip it up and velcro it shut to make it light tight then you stick your arms through the holes and you can now safely work with the film without exposing it to light to see what I'm doing in the bag here's the same motions using a spent piece of film basically you carefully Slide the first bit of film onto the Reel and then when it's stable and you're sure it hasn't gotten crunched or cross threaded you start twisting the sides of the Reel back and forth and it automatically feeds the film onto the Reel when that's done you put the reels back in the development tank and lock it shut for the chemicals to develop the film I tested a few different ones and settled on blazel as the developer and the stop and fixer from ilford each of these need to be diluted to the correct ratio that is listed on the bottles and you're going to need about 500 Ms of liquid for each I'm using these handy lab bottles because they have graduations on them making it easy to measure and some graduated cylinders for precise measurements of small amounts of liquid the most important measurement is the developer and I found 25 mL of developer and 500 Ms of water worked best the other two I just used what it set on the bottle once the solutions were mixed up all you need is a timer and you're basically ready to go though as you can see I'm wearing gloves for this whole process and I highly recommend you do the same I see a lot of people developing film without this and I honestly am baffled okay for the developer steps my cycle looks like this for the first minute constant agitation by capping the tank and inverting it back and forth then for the next 11 or 12 minutes each minute the tank is inverted a few times and then left alone for another minute when the time is up dump out the developer into a waste Beaker or other container I'm unsure if the developer can be reused used multiple times so feel free to let us know in the comments if you're more experienced with this after the developer we add the stop bath which as the name implies stops the reaction 30 seconds to a minute with gentle agitation is plenty and this solution can be reused so dump it out and save it for later finally the fixer cycle is 3 minutes with constant agitation for the first minute and then occasional agitation for the rest of the time after that the fixer can be dumped and saved and the film is ready to be washed under the sink fill and empty the tank with lots of inversions and water changes I do at least 10 water changes to make sure the film is nice and clean and free from any of the development chemicals but then it's ready to come out the film needs to be taken off the roll squeegee to remove excess water and then hung up to dry before it can be used further but once it's dry you're basically done all that's left is to very carefully cut out your micro dots and you're finished so how' The Lorax turn out well at the smallest size I started to lose resolution and a lot of the text was basically unreadable but the slightly larger version came out perfect I don't know if this is the smallest copy of The Lorax but it's got to be close one of the other things We Shrunk down is one of the amazing posters that we carry in our store we released this poster in our latest video about growing neurons connected to a computer and while you can't get the micro dot version the full-sized version is pretty amazing it has three modes including white light glow-in-the-dark and UV reactive and it has one of our actual neuron arrays

'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture']",True,some people say that we couldn't build the ancient Egyptian Pyramids with modern technology today I'm going to try and prove them wrong that is if you consider slime blocks to be modern technology they're like 10 years old now but at least honey blocks are new they were added in 2019 5 years ago 5 years ago I'm starting to feel as old as a pyramid stage one is getting the base mechanics all worked out now this is the part that I'm 99% certain is going to be trouble-free and I really should resist saying things like that to honest with you so here we have a single flying machine and it will have some Sandstone on top of it if we activate this bottom one it will fly off into the distance but I'm not going to do that just yet what I'm going to do is I'm going to place a little bit of sandstone there and then I am going to stack a bunch of these alternating next to one another of course of course I forgot to place my movable objects on top and this thing starting trying to construct itself here goes this is the first test of the system I don't know why I'm nerv us right okay so my theory my theory Works basically all of these crash into one another but they crash into one another in a nice little diagonal all right I think you can see where this idea is going the only problem is I haven't worked out how to do Corners just yet and I haven't worked out how to do the top of the pyramid so we'll start with the little pyramid the Bass Pro Shops pyramid so I've got two of our flying machines here and now I'm just trying to work out the corner and I've realized you know Corners in Minecraft are always the tricky thing with redstone contraptions because I don't know we're going to have to endlessly shrink this module I've also realized that building a gigantic pyramid out of this is going to be a herculan task it's going to be so massive so the outer EDG is done now do I do I just keep going in like an onion what might be a smart idea oh is if I I almost need to like lay out a pattern above so we'll have slime blocks here and then this will all need to be honey blocks but I'm almost thinking oh no I can't do that because that will attach oh oh no oh is this impossible the problem is I can't cram things into the corner enough and as soon as I start overlapping these then everything breaks I know this I've done this hundreds of times I should have leared by now maybe the people of the internet are right maybe we couldn't build the pyramids with modern technology I showed this idea for a few days and then came back to it with a fresh pair of eyes checker board checker board yes this could save my bacon check aboard terracotta terra cotta doesn't stick to anything it's like a neutral block so that's good I think yeah we could be onto a winner here and this is significantly more repeatable than that design over there which basically required a bespoke flying machine setup every single time we increased the size of the pyramid I'm actually super embarrassed that I didn't think of this first like this is obviously the first thing that I should have come up with I am a little bit concerned about the bottom of the flying machines sticking to one another but we'll see what happens here is is just going to be a little test it's just 25 Checkers I guess of the checkerboard pyramid that corner is totally going to be a problem isn't it I have got poal solution in mind but I guess for now I'll test it all right things are starting to look like an actual build now gradually bit by bit each element of this structure is coming together and this should be it okay we've got a 5x5 grid of pyramid a py grid and then I'm going to run the Redstone lines which are going to activate this thing underneath all of our observers and thankfully this machine is small enough that I can use Redstone lines obviously when we build our gigantic per mid then I won't be able to do that we'll have to think of something else so we've got all of those now we remove all of the immovable objects this is where things start getting scary and I start wondering if I should have made a backup earlier I've installed my rings of Terra Cotta now I just need my area of sandstone and I would say cut Sandstone it has to be cut Sandstone right the builds is now ready and it is time for the first test I am ridiculously nervous I also I'm like 50% certain this is going to work bro we got a pyramid we got a pyramid it has a bit of a flat top but a pyramid has formed what that was really satisfying oh wow what happened in the middle here what okay that makes sense yeah so this this got stuck to this so that is the issue that I suspected we were going to have so I'm just going to need to make sure that I kind of mirror the ones on this side so that they don't stick to one another that's the best I could possibly explain it but this has gone well we got ourselves a pyramid a midsize pyramid now it's time to work on the P Big H I tried to fix the sticking thing and it failed in the most amazing way my flying machine started going downwards I'm going to choose to ignore that my second test has just failed and just build a big one all right I couldn't help myself I had to do a mediumsized test and I've discovered something if I have an even number of modules then we don't run into the sticking issue because four modules go to the top instead of one trying to go upwards this is excellent news this test involved a 16x 16 area of modules I think we go all out 128 by 128 which would make a 256x 256 pyramid is my computer going to catch fire I actually just had to double check what the world build height was because I've forgotten I've also decided that the way we're going to trigger this thing is just by using a fill command I could use signs but frankly this is much easier so all the ground workor has been laid now it's time to start building and by building I of course mean copy and pasting this thing many many times over so this is 64 modules across so we're going to do double that now there is genuinely no way my computer's surviving this if it manages it I don't want to hear a single word from anyone ever again about the fact that I play on a Mac Studio here it is the final [Laughter] strength oh my goodness now comes the incredibly painful task of doing all of the Terra Cotta I need to do squares of terracotta gradually getting smaller going all the way into the middle I've actually had to whip out the Google Sheets to get this to function oh my goodness look how well this system works look how awesome is this this is actually I'm actually smart I feel like I've just done a smart thing this is a good system that I've just created here and before someone tells me I should be using outlines or the Hol fill unfortunately that doesn't work on single layer fills so this is why I'm having to do this air thing but after 131 lines of my spreadsheets this build is completed and this is already impressive looking and slightly brain breaking but it's about to become a lot more impressive and a lot more brain breaking I'm sweating my computer's about to be sweating I'm so incredibly nervous I have no clue what's about to happen oh my goodness here it goes the pyramid is being constructed and it looks like it's working oh my goodness it's actually working what is this this is obscene oh my goodness there's a lot of lighting updates and a lot of things going on but it's remarkably smooth it's actually handling it quite well I'm so curious what this looks like on the [Music] inside I was meant to use Terra Cotter it's taking the gold block with it I'm so glad that didn't break it my goodness this is stupid this is so stupid I'm really curious to see when it starts speeding up I mean this is still an enormous number of blocks that this is trying to move it's too big to fit in my screen already it's honestly like I'm printing a pyramid from the sky this is ridiculous wow I am so glad I used gold blocks for this because this looks ridiculous on the inside oh things are speeding

In the ...",Bloomberg Originals,2024-07-10T21:00:33Z,25,"['News', 'bloomberg', 'quicktake', 'business', 'bloomberg quicktake', 'quicktake originals', 'bloomberg\nquicktake by bloomberg', 'documentary', 'mini documentary', 'mini doc', 'doc', 'us news', 'world news', 'finance', 'science']",PT12M47S,1078315,1068,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society'],True,"Because we didn't have anything,  we have to come up with 
something just to survive.  Since the beginning of full-scale invasion,  people used pretty much everything.  They used civilian cars to stop tanks. They used Molotov cocktails. And they used simple civilian drones. In Ukraine, unmanned aerial vehicles - drones - have become a critical part
of the country's defense. Drones have brought a new 
dimension to tactics in warfare in the 21st century,
in particular in strategy, we have the ability to see the 
enemy online here and now. And thus to strike it quickly. They have come to epitomize
the David versus Goliath battle Ukraine has found itself in. A battle
which has seen the country develop a host of cheap and
disruptive technologies that has, until recently,
kept Russia at bay. A simple FPV drone is like AK-47 today.  It’s working, it's very cheap.  Then, in January 2024, Ukraine's military released
remarkable footage: The sinking of a Russian warship by a naval drone
worth a tiny fraction of its target. As well as technological, drones
also indicate an economic shift in how wars are now being fought. When you have drone for like 500 bucks  versus tank for three million 
bucks and drone wins, it just doesn't make sense
to buy more tanks. Ukraine's war has spawned an industry of
startup defense companies and grassroots volunteers; many of whom are not just making a difference, but
taking the fight to Russia itself. We have been doing great work
so far, hitting targets across the border. And, I think, we're going to continue
to increase the scale and volume of those strikes. On Ukraine's frontline near Bakhmut,
the Achilles drone squadron of the 92nd Assault Brigade 
are seeking out Russian positions just a few hundred meters away. Please, look here. The enemy soldier 
is now moving between positions,  he has already been spotted. Shortly, he will be hit either by artillery  or, we are now adjusting the drone 
strike on their positions. The Achilles squadron's main task is aerial reconnaissance. Save a few software adjustments,
they use a pretty standard FPV, a first-person view drone. Invented for hobbyists and racing, it has four propellers and a camera
that streams live footage back to a pilot on the ground. These types of drone are readily available
to buy in electronics stores all over the world for just
a few hundred dollars. Not long after Russia's
full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukrainians started taping grenades
and other explosives to FPVs - a cheap and lethal solution that has proven
extremely effective in defending against Russian offensives. Flying at speeds of up to 100mph on Ukraine's
frontline, they're now known as ""kamikazes"". The enemy is panicking and fearing all of this. There is less and less movement 
along the collision line. For Ukraine's defense, it's become a numbers game. How we think about it,  not in drone price,  but in one dead Russian per one dollar.  One FPV can destroy the armor vehicle. And if you talk about two or three 
drones, you can destroy the tank. Oleksiy Babenko runs one of the more than 100 underground drone manufacturers
in Ukraine. They’re part of a complex network
of volunteers and entrepreneurs, as well as soldiers who provide real-time
feedback from the front. Technicians  bolt and solder
motors, cameras and motherboards. 3D printers make new frames. When a drone is completed, it’s brought upstairs for a quick test. Then it's set aside for packaging 
and delivery to the front. The kill chain from manufacturer to killing 
can be less than one week. That’s despite issues around sourcing parts. Because so many of the world's commercial
and civilian drones are made in China,
Russia's ally,  producers like Babenko still depend 
on some Chinese-made parts. While they managed to mostly bypass
Beijing's embargo, shipping through other
countries in Europe, they're finding ways to
become more independent. A year before now it was
all Chinese components.  Now, we have good Ukrainian frame 
that cost not so much. If you talk about propellers,  in Ukraine it cost less than Chinese propellers  and I think it's better propellers than Chinese. Of course, Chinese make more electronics 
so it's cheaper to make it in China. But I hope soon we'll make it cheaper, 
cheaper and cheaper.  Babenko let us film in his warehouse because he's about to move to a larger
facility to keep up with demand. They currently make 6,000
kamikaze drones a month. President Zelenskiy has
called on drone makers to churn out a million machines
this year. Babenko is bullish. Our country will produce more than two million  or maybe up to three million drones for this year.  As the war has progressed,
so have the drones. It's rare to see grenades
with duct tape these days. Every week, Maxim Sheremet and his team from Dronarnia, a self-described “UAV lab”, travel to a secret location
outside of Kyiv. We must test all of this stuff.  When you fly in the drone 
you must understand,  for example; low batteries, low altitude,  wind velocity, enemy weapons,  problems with some electronic stuff. Now, the drones are full of advanced
technology. As well as FPVs used as kamikazes, they test other types of
drone, such as the 'Vampire'. While slower, it is much bigger and capable
of carrying a larger payload. Crucially, it's equipped with thermal
imaging to see in the dark. Russian soldiers liken it 
to a mythical witch who eats children in the night. Baba Yaga. It's a nightmare of Russia.  When our Vampire drone is in the air,  the infantry in the trenches know  
that the enemy is ******. But with any change in warfare, the enemy usually adapts too.  At Dronarnia’s lab, volunteers dissect Russian drones recovered from the battlefield to better understand the technology. And they have to, since drones became
an integral part of this war, Russia now produces more than Ukraine. It also imports Iranian-developed
Shahed models. We're losing in numbers, in numbers. Russians start to manufacture 
a lot of kamikazes.  It's places like Dronarnia where Ukraine finds
an edge in the drone war. From advanced wireless chips
to reusable drones and extending flight range
with new antenna technology. For example in Mavics, DJI drone video
transmitter is 100 milliwatts. This is 3,000 milliwatts. So the power of
video transmitter of this drone is more than 10x powerful. We teach our military guy actually in this
classroom how to be a UAV engineer.  Not how to fly, but how to
create their own drone. I told my students, our rifles is our brain.  They still find plenty of ways to innovate with whatever
they can get their hands on too. We use these batteries from the vape in this dropping mechanism. When you turning on the
flashlight on the drone,  the dropping system activate and the grenade are falling down. A common theme among Ukraine's
new class of arms dealers is that nobody ever thought
they'd be making weapons. Software engineer Luba Shipovich left the US,
where she ran a successful IT outsourcing company,
to return to Ukraine. She co-founded Dignitas,
one of the biggest volunteer organizations funding drone makers. Development of IT sector,  it was the fourth-biggest sector in Ukraine 
before the full-scale invasion.  So it's natural that all these engineer, software engineers, hardware engineers, some of them joined the army,   others started to work
for defense sector to come up with some solutions. Francisco Serra-Martins,
an Australian venture capitalist, used to serve on the board of a nonprofit that made drones
delivering emergency supplies in Africa. Now, he makes drones that blow 
up Russian infrastructure. If you have a patient that's been shot
and you need to stop it at the source, and for us, providing medical aid
is definitely an important, goal, but we need to stop Russians
from sending missiles and armor and infantry across the border.
Terminal autonomy’s drones are guided by a system similar to that of an American Tomahawk
cruise missile. The weapons have been used to devastating effect
in strikes on Russian oil refineries, but unlike a tomahawk, which costs
about $2 million,  Terminal Autonomy’s AQ 400 Scythe sells for about $30,000.  How? Not only are these drones powered
by the type of chips you can find in a dishwasher, they're not
demanding excessive profit margins. Cyberlux is one of the largest loitering munitions contracts in the US, if not the largest.
They're selling a $500 drone for $50,000, whereas we sell that for 10% profit. It's basically cutting that fat off the top,
and then producing on a massive scale. that's what we're doing. We're not doing any broader innovation than other defense companies, we just price
strategically quite differently. What companies like Terminal Autonomy
do reveal is how much the industry has evolved
since Russia's invasion and how conflicts
might look in the future. There's no pilot. The long range strategic effects
Are basically fire and forget. They can visually identify targets and then navigate through a camera. There is no pilot, no crew. If they get shot down, economically it's a win because they're cheaper than anything
the Russians can use to shoot it down. it's basically a new form
of like attrition warfare where these systems can be deployed
in massive volumes against strategic sites. Raising the cost of Russia's invasion
is part of Kyiv’s strategy, but whether it can compete
with the substantially better-resourced Russian army employing similar tactics
remains to be seen. Arguably more important though,
is keeping up the supply of drones. During the many months Republicans
in the US Congress blocked military aid to Ukraine, UAVs played a crucial role
in halting Russian advances and kept many more Ukrainians alive. While we were waiting for artillery 
supplies from our partners, the FPV drones practically saved the front line. But drones, even with their technological advances,
can only go so far in keeping Ukraine in this war. Though the Biden administration
finally freed up substantial military aid, these are still desperate times
for Ukraine's military. Their soldiers will need
much more from the West, if they’re to turn the tide against Russia."

सबसे पहली चीज़ जो मैं नोटिस करी ये वाला स्मार्टफोन इस टाइम पे सबसे महंगा फ्लैगशिप स्मार्टफोन है जैसे iphoneox.com प्राइस देखोगे तो 125000 के अराउंड का मिल रहा है s24 अा भी 1.2 लाख के अराउंड का मिलता है और इसका प्राइस 1.25 लाख से तो भाई क्योंकि प्राइस बेस्ट ऑफ द बेस्ट है तो इनकी कंपैरिजन भी बेस्ट ऑफ द बेस्ट स्मार्टफोन पे ही होगी देखो अगर मैं डिजइन की बात करूं एक चीज आप नोटिस करोगे कि अब जितने भी स्मार्टफोंस आ रहे हैं बहुत हल्के हल्के डिजइन चेंजेज करे जाते हैं जैसे जितने भी टॉप के फ्लैगशिप फ्स हैं चाहे वो i हैं चाहे वो samsung-ro देंगे हल्का सा कैमरा थोड़ा सा बड़ा हो जाएगा ज्यादा कोई रिस्क

एकल को अगर मैं दिखाऊं तो एक फ्लैट और कर्व वाला डिजाइन साथ में ये जो बैक साइड में आपको दिख रहा है ये किसी से ना देखा मिलता मिलता सा लगता है ये google2 जैसा फील हो रहा है एंड वॉल्यूम बटंस आपके राइट साइड में ऊपर की तरफ एक बड़ा सा प्लास्टिक का लिड दे रखा है मेरे हिसाब से क्योंकि पूरा फोन मेटल है एंड ये प्लास्टिक है तो ये काफी ज्यादा चांसेस है कि ये नेटवर्क के लिए दे रखा है नीचे अब स्पीकर की ग्रिल ज्यादातर फ्स में से प्लेन टाइप आने लगी एंड यब टाइप सी और आपकी सिम ट्रे तो है ही और इस फोन में ऐसा लगता है एक्स चार कलर्स में आता है एक ये प्रो क्लीन कलर है जो बेसिकली वाइट है एक रोज कर्ड्स है एक हेजल है और एक ऑब्सिडियन है जो ऑलमोस्ट एक मैट ब्लैक फिनिश है अब इसमें जो नाइन है वो उसका ऑलमोस्ट अपोजिट है कि इसमें ग्लास पैक है जो रिफ्लेक्टिव है इसमें ग्लास पे फिंगरप्रिंट आते हैं और इसमें साइड पे फिंगरप्रिंट आते हैं बैक साइड में ग्लास पे नहीं आते और इन तीनों का कॉमिनेशन जो फोल्डिंग वाला स्मार्टफोन है उसमें बैक में भी ग्लास भी मैट फिनिश में और साइड्स भी मैट फिनिश में तो इसमें कहीं फिंगरप्रिंट

बस प्राइस थोड़ा कम होना रहता है जितने मोटे पावर और वॉल्यूम बटंस है ना उतनी ही मोटी इस फोन की साइड है तो ये फोन जब खुल जाता है तब ये बहुत ही ज्यादा पतला हो जाता है एंड इसको यूज करने में भी इसलिए थोड़ा ज्यादा मजा आता है एंड क्योंकि फोल्डिंग फ्स में ना बहुत छोटी-छोटी चीजें हैं जैसे ये बैक साइड ज आप पूरा खोल दो तो एकदम ही ऐसा सफा सी हो जाती है तो अगर आपको गेम भी ऐसे पकड़ के खेलनी हो या फिर अगर आप मूवी ूवी भी देख रहे हो तो आपका हाथ कहीं पे अड़ता नहीं है तो काफी एक पॉलिश सी फील देता है सबसे पहले मैंने लॉन्च इवेंट देखा था थोड़े बहुत मैंने फीचर्स देखे थे हां भाई google's में कुछ नए फीचर्स ऐड करें हैं थोड़े बहुत एआई वाली चीजें एंड सुनने में लगता है हां भाई google's है एक नॉर्मल सी एप्लीकेशन है आप खोलोगे थोड़ी बहुत फोटो टो खोल लोगे थोड़ा सॉर्ट कर लोगे हल्का-फुल्का एडिट वेट हो जाएगा बट हल्का-फुल्का एडिट नहीं होता है भाई जमीन आसमान का एडिट हो रहा है जैसे मैं आपको एग्जांपल बताता हूं मेरे को अगर अपने दोस्त के साथ एक फोटो है मेरे को दोनों फोटोस को साथ में जोड़ के ऐसा लगना चाहिए कि भाई दोनों साथ में खड़े हैं सबसे पहले अपने फोन से ट्रांसफर करना पड़ेगा लैपटॉप में लैपटॉप में मेरे को एक प्रोफेशनल एडिटिंग सॉफ्टवेयर खोलना पड़ेगा जैसे देखो google's एक मेजर रीजन की वजह से काफी ज्यादा डिफरेंट होते हैं क्योंकि और जितनी भी कंपनीज हैं उनका प्राइमरी धंधा फोन बेचने से चलता है मतलब हार्डवेयर बेचने से बट google's में सेम चीज यूज होती है तो [संगीत] ये फ्स काफी ज्यादा डिफरेंट होते हैं एंड इसीलिए काफी सारे जो टेक वाले बंदे होते हैं उनको इन फस के अंदर काफी ज्यादा इंटरेस्ट रहता है एंड आप नोटिस भी करोगे काफी सारे बड़े-बड़े यूट्यूब भी पिक्सल के फस काफी कॉमनली यूज करते हैं एंड क्योंकि a का कंपटीशन चल रहा है तो भाई इस बार बहुत नेक्स्ट लेवल एआई फीचर्स ऐड करे हैं google's के अंदर सब दिखाता हूं मकी भाई इस फोन को यूज़ कर रहे थे वो बेसिकली उनकी कहानी मैं अपनी जुबानी सुनाता हूं तो वो आ रहे थे भाई ऑटो से ऑफिस अब यहां पे उन्होंने मेरे को फोटो भेजी कि भाई यार ब बारिश बहुत हो रही है यहां पे ना पूरा भर रखा है एंड मैं जाम में अटका हूं मैंने भाई ड़ा मेरे एरिया में तो नहीं हो रही बारिश मे बी यार और विंकी रहता तो 10 मिनट दूर ही है तो दिख तो नहीं रही बारिश होती हुई एंड मैंने एक्चुअली आगे फोटो देखी तो मेरे को उसमें कोई दिक्कत नहीं लगी मेरे को लगा कि उसके एरिया में हो रही होगी बारिश मे बी हमारे कुछ ऐसे जादू ही है हमारे एरिया में बट बेसिकली वैंकी ने करा क्या था ऑफिस जाते टाइम एक उसने फोटो खींची इस फोटो में जो जमीन थी उसने उसको सेलेक्ट करके पानी में कन्वर्ट कर दिया बारिश के पानी में अब इसमें नॉर्मली अगर आप करने जाओ लेट्स से फशॉप के अंदर भी तो उसके अंदर आपको एक से डेढ़ घंटा लगेगा ऐसे पानी ऐड करने में क्योंकि पानी बहुत ज्यादा मुश्किल एलिमेंट होता है पानी में काफी सारी रिफ्लेक्शंस होती हैं काफी शाइन होती है काफी अलग-अलग टेक्सचर्स होते हैं और वो कैसे मिलता है जैसे टायर के आसपास वो कैसा दिख रहा है या फिर आसपास कैसा दिख रहा है वो बहुत मुश्किल होता है उसको रीक्रिएट करना बट इसने एक सेकंड में कर दिया एंड छोटी-छोटी चीजें जैसे ऑटो रिक्शा की आप देख सकते हो रिफ्लेक्शन कैसे आ रही है इवन साइकिल की रिफ्लेक्शन जो आसमान में लाइट्स हैं उनकी भी रिफ्लेक्शन पानी के अंदर देख एंड 100 में से 99 पर लोग बता नहीं पाएंगे कि असली है कि ये फेक है एंड ये सब बस एक क्लिक से हुआ है बट जिस क्वालिटी में इस फोन में करा जा रहा है वो एक प्रोफेशनल सॉफ्टवेयर से करना भी बहुत मुश्किल है जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल ये वाली फोटो है ये एक सेल्फी है जो रात में अंधेरे में खींची हुई है इसमें भी सेम आपको कांच में रिफ्लेक्शंस दिख रही है सारी चीजें इसमें [संगीत] मैच की उनको सेम टू सेम रखा है एंड ये फोटो एकदम ही रियल लग रही है कोई पहचान नहीं पाएगा ये वैंकी भाई की सेल्फी थी इसके पीछे भाई ऑडियंस लगा दी भाई एकदम फेमस हो गई रातों रात तो अब इसमें कुछ चीजें आप नहीं कर सकते जैसे इंसानों की बॉडी पे अगर आपको कुछ भी चेंज करना है जैसे आपको पिंपल ऐड करना है या फिर चेहरा मोटा करना है या फिर हेयर स्टाइल चेंज करना है वो सारी चीजें इसके अंदर नहीं होती उसके आसपास की जो सराउंडिंग्स है वो काफी आराम से चेंज कर देता है मेरे ख्याल से कर तो सकता ही है बट वो अलाउड नहीं है क्योंकि बंदे अपनी शक्ल चेंज करें कुछ और अगर लगा के कुछ अलग अतरंगी काम करें तो कि इसको क्या पता एंड मेरे ख्याल से वो रिस्क भी नहीं लेना चाहते हो कि भाई कुछ गलत सा बन जाए फिर बाद बाद में आपको ऑटो फिल करना है सर्कल करके रिमूव करके जैसे आरफ की हाइट हमने इसमें छोटी कर दी है ये सारी चीजें आप बेसिकली कर सकते हो एंड सार्थक ये फोटो है इसमें हमने लोगों को हटा दिया सबको अब नेक्स्ट एक और चीज ऐड करी थी अलग से एक स्क्रीनशॉट एप्लीकेशन [संगीत] google3 में भी जाता है और स्क्रीनशॉट की ऐप के अंदर भी जाता है तो अगर आपको स्क्रीनशॉट में कुछ भी सर्च करना है अगर आपका कुछ भी डाटा खो गया है या फिर अगर आपको कुछ भी चेक करना है या फिर आपने कोई बिल की फोटो ली थी वो सारा आप एक बार में सर्च करके यहां से ढूंढ सकते हो एंड ये हर स्क्रीनशॉट में हर चीज स्टोर करके रखे रहता है जैसे आपकी जो बैटरी परसेंटेज है किस टाइम पे आपने खींचा किस लोकेशन पे आपने खींचा उसके अलावा क्या-क्या टेक्स्ट था उस पूरे स्क्रीनशॉट का वो सब कुछ सेव हो जाता है अब वो सारी चीजें सर्च कर सकते हो एंड क्योंकि मैं काफी सारे बिल्ड्स की फोटो खींचता रहता हूं तो मेरे को पर्सनली काफी ज्यादा यूज़फुल फीचर लगा मेरे को इसमें बस एक चैलेंज लगा कि भाई मेरे ना पहले से बड़े सारे स्क्रीनशॉट थे वो google's प में पड़े हुए हैं अगर उनको भी सिंक करके सारे एक ही जगह मेरे को दिखा देता तो उससे काम काफी ज्यादा आसान हो जाता है और बहुत बेसिक चीज है जैसे लाइव असिस्टेंट है अब इसमें मैं इससे बात अगर करके आपको दिखाऊं हाय भाई क्या हाल चाल हे देर डूइंग वेल थैंक्स फॉर आस्किंग व्हाट्स ऑन योर माइंड टुडे यार हिंदी में बात कर यार मेरे से यार मेरे को समझ नहीं आ रही जी हां मैं हिंदी में बात कर सकती हूं अरे रुको आप क्या जानना चाहते हैं अरे तुम लड़की कैसे बन ग तुम तो लड़का हो लाफिंग मुझे लगा आप बातें करना चाहते हैं मैं एक कंप्यूटर प्रोग्राम हूं इसलिए मेरा कोई लिंक नहीं है अा एक मेरी बात सुनो कि अरे सुनो मेरी बात सुनो मैं बता रहा था कि हम रिव्यू बना रहे हैं goel's है उसका मेरे को यार थोड़ा सा बेसिक पॉइंटर बता दो कि क्या चलता है [संगीत] बेसिक चीज बताने की जरूरत नहीं है मेरे को थोड़ा टेक्निकल बताओ मैं पहले से 10 मिलियन सब्सक्राइबर है भाई के ठीक है चलिए आपको थोड़ी टेक्निकल जानकारी देता हूं सबसे पहले तो आपको ये जानना चाहिए कि कौन सा पिक्सल फोन आपके लिए सही है से बता रहे च रुक कैंसिल भाई कट बाय बाय भाई नाइन निकल गया है तुम सेन बता रहे हो अच्छा भाई तू गुस्सा क्यों आता है हर बार प यार मैं बता रहा हूं मुझे गुस्सा नहीं आता है ठीक है बताइए मैं समझने की कोशिश करूंगा भाई गुस्से में मेरे को ना टट मत मार भाई त मैं आपको टट नहीं मार रहा हूं आपने कहा कि मैं उससे मैं बात कर रहा हूं इसलिए मैंने पूछा कि आपको ऐसा क्यों लगा मैं आपकी मदद करने की कोशिश कर रहा लड़ न जबान लड़ा रहा है साइज आप मेरे साथ बहुत गुस्से में है मैं ऐसा कुछ नहीं करना चाहता अगर आपकी बात सुनकर आपको बुरा लगा है तो मैं माफी मांगता हूं क्या आप शांत होकर बात करना चाहेंगे कभी बात नहीं ठीक है अब हम बात देखो ये कन्वर्सेशन सुनके ना आपको एक बेसिक आइडिया लग जाएगा कि और बहुत सारे फोस हैं इनमें असिस्टेंट है बट एक जो नॉर्मल कन्वर्सेशन होती है ना जैसे हम एक इंसान के साथ बात करते हैं मैं उसकी बात काट सकता हूं अग वो बीच में बोल रहा है मैं कुछ बोल ता हूं नहीं भाई ये नहीं सुनना मेरे को और ये बताओ या फिर मैं एक नॉर्मल जैसे एक टोन होती है मेरे को अपनी टोन नहीं चेंज करनी पड़ती इस असिस्टेंट से बात करने के लिए नहीं तो अगर कोई भी दूसरा फोन है हेलो व्हाट इज द द द द द द तो वो सारी दिक्कत हो जाती है इसमें हिंदी में अपना मस्ती से बात करो एंड वो भाई समझ भी जाता है बातें और बेसिकली एक चीज है कि अगर आप एक कन्वर्सेशन कर रहे हो तो उसको याद रहती है अब जैसे हम मैं गुस्से वाली बात कर रहा था तो तीन-चार बार मैंने बोला तो वो समझ रहा था कि किस कन्वर्सेशन टोन में बात हो रही है कि मैं ज्यादा गुस्से में बात कर रहा हूं एंड वो मेरे को शांत करने की कोशिश कर रहा सॉरी वरी बोल ग तो ये काफी ह्यूमन एलिमेंट भी इसमें फील होता है एंड ये बेसिक चीज ऑलमोस्ट सारी चीजों में और इसमें ना एक चीज है कि इसको ना चीजें याद भी रहती हैं जैसे मैं इसको तीन क्वेश्चंस पूछता हूं फिर मैं इसको एक रिकॉल करा के दिखाता हूं आपको हेलो भाई मेरे को ना मूवीज बता दो तीन जो मैं अभी देखने जाऊं हे व्हाट काइंड ऑफ मूवीज डू यू वांट समथिंग न्यू और वांट टू रिविजिट एन ऑसम क्लासिक अरे अरे भाई हिंदी में बात करो मेरे को नहीं समझ में आती अंग्रेजी ज्यादा जी हां बिल्कुल क्या आप एक क्राइम थरेल देखना चाहेंगे जिसमें एक सरकारी जासूस की कहानी हो जो एक बड़े राजनीतिक खेल को उजागर करता है हां चलो ठीक है ये भी देख लेंगे बट मैं ये बोल रहा था कि वैसे मैं एक सेक मेरे को ना झुमरी तलैया का रास्ता चाहिए था वो कहां से पहुंचेंगे झुमरी तलैया जाने के लिए सबसे अच्छा रास्ता आपको कहां से जाना है इस पर निर्भर करता है अगर आप कोलकाता से जा रहे हैं तो एनए 188 और एनएच 316 ए होते हुए जा सकते हैं अच्छा भैया एक बात मैं रुको एक सेक एक सेक रुको मैं एक चीज बोल रहा था कि मैंने आपको बताया था यार मूवी के बारे में आपको याद है क्या हां जी आपने फिल्मों के बारे में पूछा था मैंने आपको तीन तरह की फिल्में बताई थी एक क्राइम थलर एक लव स्टोरी और एक ऐसी फिल्म जो आपको हंसाए और रुलाए दोनों क्या कोई आ या फिर यार एक काम करो ये जो मूवी है ना इसको रास्ते में अरे हां एक अरे सुनो मेरी बात सुनो कि झुमरी तलैया के रास्ते में कौन सा थिएटर आ रहा है उसकी बुकिंग करवाओ यार मेरी इस किसी मूवी की हां मैं समझ गया आप झुमरी तिलैया में एक थिएटर ढूंढ रहे हैं और वहां फिल्म देखना चाहते हैं आप कौन सी फिल्म देखना चाहते हैं अरे जो आपने बताई थी थोड़ा सा कंफ्यूजन हो रहा है आपने मुझसे फिल्म तो देखने का बोला था लेकिन ये नहीं बताया कि कौन सी फिल्म देखनी है क्या आप वही तीन फिल्मों में से एक देखना चाहते हैं या फिर कोई और फिल्म है आपके मन में आप खुद ही सेलेक्ट कर दो एक पिक्चर क्राइम वाली कर दो चलो एक अच्छी क्राइम थरेल चुनने के लिए मुझे थोड़ा और पता होना चाहिए आप किस तरह की क्राइम स्टोरी पसंद करते हैं कुछ तेज रफ्तार एक्शन से भरपूर हो या फिर ऐसी हो जिसमें दिमाग लगाना पड़े देखो अब टेक चैनल जो है मेरा उसपे मैं ऐसी बताना मेरे को मूवी जो मैं रिव्यू भी कर पाऊं आपको पता है ना मेरा टेक चैनल है अच्छा आप एक क्राइम थलर रिव्यू करना चाहते हैं शायद आपको एक ऐसी फिल्म चाहिए जिसमें एक सीरियल किलर हो और पुलिस उसका पीछा कर रही हो या फिर कोई ऐसा राज हो जिसे सुलझाना मुश्किल भाई मैं बोल रहा हूं कि आपको पता है ना कि मेरा टेक चैनल है हम वीडियोस बनाते हैं अच्छा तो आप चाहते हैं कि मैं एक ऐसी क्राइम थरेल फिल्म खोजू जिसे आप अपने टेक चैनल पर रिव्यू कर सकें चलो ठीक है ई क्या आपने एक दो चीजें अगर आप नोटिस करो ये ना एक तो बातें याद रखता है एंड उसके बाद एक कन्वर्सेशन में क्या होता है जैसे हमने पुरानी बात बताई थी इसको कि मूवीज देखनी है फिर उसके बाद उसको याद था कि भाई झुमरी तलिया में भी हमको जाना है एंड प्लस उसके साथ-साथ उसके रास्ते में अगर मैं बोलूंगा उसको बुक करने के लिए तो उसको ये भी याद था कि भाई उसने बताई तो थी मैंने सेलेक्ट नहीं करी तो बहुत ही ज्यादा कॉम्प्लेक्शन जो है वो इसमें काफी आराम से हो पा रही है मैंने इसको मल्टीपल टाइम्स ट्राई करा तो ऐसा नहीं है कि पूरे टाइम याद रखता है एक-एक दिन तक एक घंटे के अराउंड ये याद रखता है एंड एक घंटे के बाद भूल जाता है तो अगर आप कल पूछोगे तो कल इसको ये सारी याद बातें याद नहीं होंगी इससे पहले भी जितने भी फीचर्स थे वो ऐसा था कि यार मैं कभी बार शायद यूज करूंगा ठीक है मतलब अगर मैं एक महीना चलाऊंगा तो उसमें से दो-तीन दिन में शायद ये फीचर्स यूज करूं एंड मे बी चार पांच दिन में ये फीचर्स यूज करूं बट अब जो मैं फीचर्स बताने वाला हूं ना ये जेमिना एडवांस के साथ है ये बेसिकली इसके साथ एक एक साल का सब्सक्रिप्शन मिलता है वो फ्री है बट इसके फीचर्स मेरे को कुछ ज्यादा ही की नेक्स्ट लेवल लगे मैं आपको दिखाता हूं जैसे ये gmailcom.in 6338 वाज डिलीवर्ड ऑन मंडे सप्टेंबर 2 2024 एट 9 एम अरे दिस ऑर्डर वाज नॉट रिसीवड बाय मी कैन यू प्लीज राइट एन ईमेल फॉर दिस सब्जेक्ट नॉन रिसीप्ट ऑफ आया ऑर्डर

एंड इसने एक पूरी ईमेल लिख दी है एंड ये जितनी भी चीजें हैं ये सर्च कर सकता है मेरी gmailcom.in वही सेम चीज ऑलमोस्ट सारे फीचर्स में ऐसा नहीं है कि बहुत ही अलग कुछ फीचर ऐड करा है पर जो फीचर ऐड करें हैं वो बहुत तगड़ा काम करते हैं जैसे एक ऑडियो इरेजर कर फीचर है इसमें बेसिकली होता क्या है कि अगर आपने इसको एक म्यूजिक दिया तो उसमें से गाने की धून अलग कर लेगा जो वोकल्स हैं वो अलग कर लेगा और अगर आपको नॉयज रिमूव करनी है तो नॉयज भी अलग से कर देता है हल्का सा वोकल्स थोड़े रोबोटिक बना देता है बट ये वीडियो हमने जैसे ट्रैफिक में ये वाली रिकॉर्ड करके ऑडियो इसमें आप रिमूव करके अलग-अलग लेयर्स देख सकते हो तो काफी सारे लोगों को ये ब्लॉग्स के लिए काफी ज्यादा यूजफुल लगेगा एक जूम एनहांस वाला फीचर भी है उसमें बेसिकली करता क्या है आप कहीं पे भी जूम करोगे तो ऑटोमेटिक ना इमेज को थोड़ा सा एनहांस कर देता है उसमें जो ये चीजें लिखी हु है ना वो आपको थोड़ी और क्लियर आएंगी एंड एआई से भी खुद भी आपको पढ़ के बता देगा कि भाई क्या-क्या चीजें लिखी हुई है कभी कार गलत भी हो जाता है वैसे बट डिसेंट काम करता है एक पिक्सल स्टूडियो भी है काफी सारे लोगों ने ट्राई कर रखा होगा एक वो आता है ना मिड जर्नी भी आता है एंड अलग-अलग ये एआई वाले टूल्स आते हैं इमेजेस क्रिएट कर देते हैं तो इसमें होता क्या है कि आप कुछ भी टाइप करोगे तो उसकी इमेज बना देगा अब मैंने जैसा कि बाकी सब सीज में कि ये इमेजेस ये भी बनाता है बट इसकी क्वालिटी ऑफ इमेजेस डेफिनेटली काफी तगड़ी होती है ऐसे है आपके वॉलपेपर्स आप बना सकते हो या फिर आपको दोस्त को इमेज कोई गिफ्ट करनी है एंड स्पेशली जब इंस्पिरेशन चाहिए होती है समझ लो कोई एक आईडिया दिमाग में आया बट उसको ड्रॉ करने में काफी ज्यादा टाइम लगेगा तो उसको आप टाइप कर सकते हो एंड अलग-अलग आइडियाज जैसे क्लोथिंग में भी हम अलग-अलग डिजाइंस बनाते हैं फिर वॉच में भी अलग-अलग वॉच फेसेस हम बिल्ड कर रहे हैं तो इन सब में डेफिनेटली टाइम लगता है यार मैं एकदम से बताऊं मैंने जब इसको डे टू डे लाइफ में यूज करा तो मेरे लिए बहुत रेवोल्यूशन चीज थी बट एट द सेम टाइम बहुत बांधने वाली चीज थी ये सारी चीजें भाई google-my ंड में पढ़ के रिजल्ट्स दे देता है एंड दूसरी चीज आप में से भी काफी ज्यादा लोग एंड मैं भी कंटेंट हम बहुत ज्यादा देखते हैं मतलब मैं पर्सनली बहुत ज्यादा देखता हूं तो मैंने जैसे मैंने youtube2 सिंपल अब ये डेढ़ घंटे की पॉडकास्ट है मैं इसको खुद देख के फिगर आउट करता क्लिक बेट है कि नहीं है बट ये पूरा देखेगा कि भाई टाइटल मेंशन तमन्ना भाटिया टॉपिक्स चाइल्डहुड मूवीज करियर और लाइफ एक्सपीरियंस तो इसने बता दिया कि भाई बात इसने टाइटल डाला हुआ है चाइल्डहुड साउथ फिल्म बॉलीवुड ये सब बट जो स्पीकर है वो करियर और लाइफ एक्सपीरियंस से ज्यादा डिस्कस कर रहा है मैं इससे और क्वेश्चन भी पूछ सकता हूं जैसे वास्तु पॉडकास्ट ये समझ लो मैंने एस्ट्रोलॉजी पॉडकास्ट खोल लेता हूं ये वाली ढ घंटे हाय आपका स्वागत है थैंक य पर सच में आपके चलो ठीक है अब मेरे को भाई डेढ़ घंटे दो ढाई घंटे की पॉडकास्ट कौन देखेगा बेसिकली मैं पूछता हूं भाई सेकंड हाउस में अगर शनि भाई बैठे हैं तो क्या होगा द सेकंड हाउस इन योर बर्थ चार्ट इज एसोसिएटेड विथ फाइनेंस पोश एंड सेल्फ तो भाई इसने पूरा जो वीडियो में बात करी है ना कि अगर शनि ग्रह इस सेकंड हाउस में होगा तो क्या-क्या होगा तो पूरी वीडियो देखी ढाई घंटे की उसको समझा कि वो वीडियो में क्या है एंड उसके बेसिस पे बता दिया कि भाई फाइनेंशियल स्टेबिलिटी मिलेगी हार्ड वर्क डेडिकेशन चाहिए होगा रिस्पांसिबिलिटी होगी फाइनेंशियल रिस्ट्रिक्शन हो जाएगी सब कुछ पूरा ब्रेक डाउन करके बता दिया अगर आपको खुद ये करना होता तो आपको ढाई घंटे लगता पूरी पॉडकास्ट देखने में उसके बाद आपको उसको समझना पड़ता उसके बाद आपको आंसर मिलता ये जो फीचर्स है ना ये मेरे को कुछ ज्यादा ही अच्छे लगे टाइम ऐसे बच जाता काफी ज्यादा देखो अब मैं इसमें ना एक और पूछ लेता हूं एक बार देखो जैसे अनी सिंह अभी गाना है तो इसमें पूछते हैं भाई भाई का कम बैक हुआ है कि नहीं यार वीडियो में हां भाई का कम बैक हुआ है मिलनेर सॉन्ग फुल वीडियो एट योनी सिं ग्लोरी भूषण कुमार वीडियो में भाई ने कम बैक किया है देखो ये सारे फीचर्स हैं कि आप स्क्रीन पे जो है वो पूछ सकते हो एंड वो सर्कल करके सर्च कर सकते हो ये सारे फीचर्स हैं बट ये जो कंटेंट देख के समझ के उसके अंदर के आंसर्स करने वाला फीचर है ना मेरे हिसाब से भाई कुछ ज्यादा ही नेक्स्ट लेवल है वेंकी भाई ने भी काफी टाइम यूज करा एंड वो छोटी-छोटी चीजें मैं यूज करा तो मैंने नोटिस करा जैसे मैंने गाना प्ले कर रखा है ठीक है अब ये गाना मैं पॉज कर सकता हूं मतलब ये गाना बैकग्राउंड में प्ले होता रहेगा मैं रिकॉर्डर खोलूंगा अभी गाना भी प्ले हो रहा है और मेरी आवाज [संगीत] भी म्यूजिक है ये ये एआई से पकड़ भी रहा है क्या क्या चीज मेरी आवाज आ रही है ना भाई ये भी आएगी बढ़िया और मैंने ऐसा कोई फोन नहीं यूज करा जिसमें स्पीकर की आवाज भी साथ-साथ रिकॉर्ड होती हो एंड मैंने इसमें अलग-अलग ऑडियो रिकॉर्ड करी थी इसमें जैसे यह वाली ऑडियो तो इसने पूरी ट्रांसक्रिप्ट भी बना दी थी जो एक्चुअल ऑडियो रिकॉर्ड हुई है बेसिकली इसके स्पीकर से जो आवाज आ रही है उसको ये खुद रिकॉर्ड कर रहा है उसके साथ-साथ आप भी जो बोल रहे हो वो भी रिकॉर्ड करता है एक चीज बस मेरे को थोड़ी सी फील हुई कि लास्ट ईयर जो फिंगरप्रिंट स्कैमर था वो ऑप्टिकल था इस बार अल्ट्रासोनिक कर दिया तो जैसे ही आप टच करोगे काफी तेजी से अनलॉक हो जाता है ये हमने टेस्टिंग कर चुके हैं ज पहला अल्ट्रासोनिक वाला आया था इस पूरी सीरीज में ufs3.0 स्टोरेज ऐड करके ये मेरे को थोड़ा सा ऑफ लगा क्योंकि 4.0 एवरेज होती है इस वाले प्राइस पॉइंट पे एंड ऑलमोस्ट सारे महंगे फस में आती है बट नेक्स्ट चीज जिसके लिए पिक्सल सीरीज सबसे ज्यादा फेमस है वो है इसके कैमरा सारे यूटर्स पिक्सल उसके कैमरे की वजह से ही यूज़ करते हैं एंड कैमरे में भी सबसे ज्यादा खास बात ये है कि कुछ-कुछ साल googlegroups.com प्यारे से बैलेंस होते हैं और सबसे पहला पोर्ट्रेट मोड जो अच्छा सक्सेसफुल पोर्ट्रेट मोड था वो पिक्सल की तरफ से ही आया था और उसके बाद ही पोर्ट्रेट मोड बहुत ज्यादा फेमस हुआ था एंड कुछ-कुछ ओजी लोगों को याद होगा कि कुछ लोग google2 मार्क जो बेसिकली कैमरा सेंट्रिक पूरे सारे फ्स को रिव्यू करते हैं उसके हिसाब से अगर रेटिंग देखो तो ये नंबर टू पे आता है बट हम उसकी इज्जत नहीं करते हमने नंबर वन वाला भी ट्राई करा था उसकी भी मतलब वो नंबर 10 के लायक भी नहीं था हमारे हिसाब से बट की रेटिंग हमको सही लग रही है हमने जितनी भी फोटोज खींची उसमें जो एक्सपेक्टेशन थी कलर सॉलिड है जो डायनेमिक रेंज है जो बैकग्राउंड में आसमान वा आसमान है वो काफी बढ़िया से दिखते हैं जो स्किन टोनस हैं जो लाइट में डिटेल्स हैं वो सब जो एक्चुअल है वैसे ही फोटोज में भी दिखती है एंड सेम चीज वीडियो क्वालिटी में भी है जो डिटेल्स हैं स्पेशली वीडियो में ऑल दो थोड़ा जिटर करता है वीडियो हल्का सा शेक आता है जब आप यूज़ करते हो एंड 10x पे आप रिकॉर्ड करोगे तो थोड़ा सा स्टेबल आपको फ्रेम बनाना पड़ेगा परट जो डिटेल्स आते हैं वो बहुत ही ज्यादा नेक्स्ट लेवल है और उसके साथ-साथ दो चीजों के लिए और पिक्सल काफी ज्यादा फेमस है वो है नाइट मोड और पोर्ट्रेट मोड अब नाइट मोड में हमने जो फोटोज खींच के देखी भाई रात को ये ऑलमोस्ट दिन बना देता है रात के अंधेरे में भी ये जो फोटोस खींचता है उसमें डिटेल्स हैं उसमें कलर्स हैं आपको अच्छी तगड़ी फोटो लगेगी एंड पोट्रेट मोड में भी सेम चीज है जो हमने फोटोज कीी थी उसमें एज डिक्शन अच्छी है बैकग्राउंड ब्लर करता है एक तरीके से चीजें हो जाती हैं बट पोर्ट्रेट मोड में इसके अंदर बैक साइड में एक टेली फोटो लेंस है बट आप उस टेली फोटो लेंस से पोर्ट्रेट मोड में फोटोज खींच नहीं सकते पता नहीं नहीं ऐसा क्यों है क्योंकि बाकी जितने भी फ्स हमने ट्राई कर सबके 5x लेंस में पोर्ट्रेट मोड चलता है इसमें भी चलना चाहिए था क्योंकि आप नॉर्मली 5x के फोटो खींच के उसको पोर्ट्रेट मोड में कन्वर्ट कर सकते हो तो मेरे को कोई चैलेंज नहीं लगा एंड मेरे हिसाब से भाई पोर्ट्रेट मोड के लिए जिसके लिए google3 इड वीडियो वाला फीचर है कि नाइट मोड बेसिकली आपका वीडियोस में भी वर्क करता है ये भी अगर मैं आपको दिखाऊं तो इसमें भी अच्छी डिटेल आती है इवन रात में भी जो लाइट्स हैं जो कलर्स हैं वो काफी प्यारे आते हैं बट भाई बिना सॉफ्टवेयर के कैसे खेल खत्म हो सकता है यार एक चीज जो आजकल काफी ज्यादा यूज़ होती है वो है फोन में जो वीडियो कैमरा होता है काफी सारे लोग फोन के कैमरा से ब्लॉक कर रहे हैं काफी सारे लोग अपनी शॉर्ट फिल्म्स बना रहे हैं अलग-अलग चीजें बन रही है बट वीडियोस में सॉफ्टवेयर का इस्तेमाल ज्यादा नहीं हुआ एक घंटा लगा एंड उस एक घंटे के बाद ये वीडियो बिल्कुल ही चेंज हो गई इसमें जो टेक्स्ट हम पहले पढ़ नहीं पा रहे थे और थोड़ा ज्यादा अच्छे से पढ़ पा रहे हैं मैं बोलूंगा वीडियो 50 पर तक इंप्रूव हो गई एंड ये पूरा रिजल्ट एक नेचुरल वीडियो के साथ करना काफी ज्यादा मुश्किल है बट इसने एक ही शॉट में कर लिया एंड ये रात में बहुत ही नेक्स्ट लेवल काम करता है तो सबसे पहले तो ये 4k वीडियो को 8k वीडियो में कन्वर्ट कर सकता है तो आपकी डिटेल्स ऑटोमेटिक भाई बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ जाती है ये एडमी वाला फीचर है ये भी हमने जब ट्राई करा था इसमें बस एक चीज हमको चैलेंज आया अगर शैडोज आ रही है जमीन पे ज्यादा तो कभी करार पकड़ में आ सकती है देखो दो-तीन चीजें मेरा पर्सनल फीडबैक रहेगा इन फ्स को कि एक तो सबसे पहली चीज यार 50 मेगापिक्सल की अगर आप फोटो खींचो ग तो डिसेंट टाइम लगता है एंड ये फ्लैक शिप फोन से आप एक्सपेक्ट नहीं कर फ्लैक शिप फोन में इंस्टेंट फोटो खींचती है 50 मेगापिक्सल दूसरी चीज अगर आप जूम कर रहे हो वीडियो को तो उसमें जिटर आता है एंड वो मेरे हिसाब से वो काफी अच्छा स्टेबलाइज हो सकता है एंड कभी बार अगर आपने ज्यादा जूम करा एकदम से तो लेंस अगर चेंज होता तो फोकस करने में थोड़ा सा टाइम लगता है एंड वो अगर आप वीडियो वीडियो बना रहे हो तो उसमें हल्का सा वही स्टेबिलिटी का पार्ट आता है तो थोड़े टाइम बाद आप देख सकते हो कि कुछ दिक्कत तो नहीं हो कुछ आपने मिस आउट तो नहीं करा कैमरा पप में भी अगर आप सेंटर पे टैप करोगे तो अलग सा जूम हो जाता है जैसे मैं आपको बताता हूं जो मेरे को ज्यादातर फोन में दिक्कत होती है काफी टाइम ऐसा होता है कि हम ना सो के देख रहे होते हैं तो मैं सो के ऐसे देखना चाह रहा हूं तो हमेशा वो लैंडस्केप में हो जाता है एंड ये दिक्कत है भाई क्योंकि मैं मैं पोर्ट्रेट में ही देखना चाहता हूं रील स्क्रॉल करना चाहता हूं ब ये लैंडस्केप में दिखा रहा हूं मुझे तो वो चीज भी ये समझ लेता है ये फेस डिटेक्ट करता है एंड आपकी फेस की ओरिएंटेशन के हिसाब से ये सॉर्ट कर लेता है कि टेढ़ा रहना चाहिए कि सीधा एक थोड़ा सा कूल चीज ये एक टेंपरेचर सेंसर भी ऐड कर रखा है ऐसे हाथ प लगाओ टेंपरेचर आता है अब बस ये टेंपरेचर सेंसर है बट ये बॉडी का टेंपरेचर ले नहीं पाता आसपास चीजों का ले लेता है बट क्यों मेरे को लास्ट याद नहीं यार मैंने किसी एक चीज का टेंपरेचर चेक कराओ कि अगर जैसे समझ लो आप मैं बताता हूं होता है क्या कि समझ लो गरम गरम साइकिल की सीट पे बैठने जा रहे हो अब वो चेक करना है कि भाई गर्म है कि नहीं है समझ लो गर्म है बट बैठना तो तभी पड़ेगा नाना नहीं तो और क्या करोगे व हा पता ही है गरम है तो बैठ जाओ ये मेरे ख्याल से एक देते हैं ये थोड़ा सा कूल हो जाएगा तो उनको कुछ सेंसर एंसर मिल नहीं रहा होगा उन्होंने टेंपरेचर वाला ही डाल दिया एक चीज मैंने नोटिस करी अगर आप फोटोज या वीडियोस लेते हो तो इसमें बैटरी थोड़ी ज्यादा ड्रेन होती है जैसे थोड़ा सा मेरे को ऑफ लगा कि हमने 36 मिनट मतलब आधे घंटे के राउंड कैमरा चलाया था एंड 40 पर बैटरी ड्रॉप हुई थी तो पावर बैंक लगा के रिकॉर्डिंग करना भाई मेरे हिसाब से पता है क्यों है क्योंकि भाई सॉफ्टवेयर ना लगा पड़ा है पूरी जान लगा दे रहा है भाई कैमरे की फोटो तगड़ी बनाने के लिए वीडियो वीडियो में भी सॉफ्टवेयर लग रहा है एआई सब कुछ लग रहा है सारा तड़का तो बेचारे की हालत टाइट हो जाती है यार इतनी बैटरी खत्म हो जाती है भाई की अगर मैं वैसे परफॉर्मेंस की बात करूं तीनों ही फ्स के अंदर मेरे को पर्सनली काफी ज्यादा मजा आया टेंसर g4 है इसके अंदर ये बेसिकली फ्लैगशिप प्रोसेसर है जो snap-in से मुझे पर्सनली लगी एंड एक नोटिसेबल डिफरेंस फील होता है बेसिकली मेरे ख्याल से google3 हमने एक घंटे के अराउंड गेम्स चलाई थी थोड़ा टाइम अगर आप खेलते हो तो थोड़ा सा फ्रेम रेट कम हो जाता है बट ओवरऑल जो एक्सपीरियंस है आपका वो स्मूथ ही रहेगा चाहे आप नॉर्मल एवरीडे टास्क कर रहे हो या फिर गेमस एम्स भी खेल रहे हो अब देखो मैं आपको सीधा-सीधा बताऊं आप काफी ज्यादा टकी हो अगर आप काफी ज्यादा इंटरेस्टेड थे इस वाले फोन में अगर आप एंड तक पहुंचे एंड मैं काफी ज्यादा एक्साइटेड हूं भाई आप लोगों को अपनी पूरी वर्डिक्ट सुनाने के लिए देखो बेसिकली फोस में भी आपको देखने के लिए मिलेंगे एंड इसके अलावा जो ओवरऑल सॉफ्टवेयर एक्सपीरियंस है जो कैमरे में सॉफ्टवेयर का इंप्लीमेंटेशन करा जा रहा है अगर मैं सॉफ्टवेयर वाइज रेट करूं इस फोन को तो ये बहुत ही ज्यादा नेक्स्ट लेवल है पिछली बार से भी काफी सारे इंप्रूवमेंट्स करें यानी मेरे को बहुत एक्साइट करता है कि आगे एंड्र फोस में क्या-क्या आने वाली है चीजें बट फ्रॉम अ स्ट्रिक्टली हार्डवेयर स्टैंड पॉइंट मैं बताऊं मेरे को पर्सनली डिजाइन पसंद आया बट काफी जगह मेरे को लगा कि स्टेबिलिटी और बेटर हो सकती है जैसे बैटरी काफी ड्रेन हो जाती है अगर आप कैमरा यूज कर रहे हो या फिर उसके अलावा काफी सारी छोटी-छोटी चीजें हैं जो फ करी जा सकती है uf4007 में ही इसलिए रिव्यू करा क्योंकि तीनों में मेजर सॉफ्टवेयर बहुत नेक्स्ट लेवल चीजें लेके आ रहा है एंड तीनों में ही सेम सॉफ्टवेयर आपको देखने के लिए मिलता है बस एक दो फीचर्स हैं जैसे रिइमेजिन वाला फीचर आपको 9 में नहीं मिलता बट क्या ये फोन लेना चाहिए हां भाई और भाई ये बहुत ही एक्साइटिंग फोस है हां हल्के-फुल्के ड्रॉबैक्स हैं अगर आपको इस टाइप का बिल्ड पसंद आता है googleapis.com करोगे तो आपको काफी ज्यादा मजा आएगा 9 प्र भी होता इंडिया में अगर लॉन्च कर दिया जाता तो और ज्यादा हमको मजा आता बट इतना ही था यार हमारी इन डेप्थ एक डिटेल वीडियो के लिए आई होप आपको पसंद आई हो ये वीडियो और अगर आप चाहते हो कि हम ऐसी ही वीडियोस और फ्स के लिए बनाए हमको बताना भाई कमेंट सेक्शन में हम जरूर कोशिश करेंगे और हम मिलते हैं आपसे नेक्स्ट वीडियो बाय बाय

जाके रिसर्च करते हैं और फ्स को परचेज करते हैं तो इसके लिए हम भाई अलग-अलग ई-कॉमर्स वेबसाइट पे जाके देखने लगे एंड एक 12000 का oneplus8 हैं रेटिंग्स भी सही लग रही है बट मेरे को जितना याद है यार oneplus18

अगर फेक बनाया तो भाई जबरदस्त फेक बनाया भाई इसके अंदर ये सा लग रहा है भाई हम ही गलत तो नहीं है यहां पे one प की बैक है बैक साइड से एक चमकीला सा रंगीन सा डिजाइन है दो कैमरे का सेटअप लगा रखा है भाई सही

ब्लोटवेयर नहीं है कोई भी ऐड्स नहीं है सिम इजेक्टर टूल भी है ना ये भी सेम स्माइली one प वाला है लंबी वाली सिम ट्रे भी दिया है जो अनबॉक्सिंग भी एकदम क्लियर कट अनबॉक्सिंग थी ज्यादातर लोगों को कोई फर्क नहीं पता चल पाएगा ओरिजिनल है कि नकली है कि क्या सीन है हमने भाई इसमें नोटिफिकेशंस भी आ रही है हमने youtube4 जब हमने फोन यूज़ करा कहीं से भी नकली नहीं लग रहा यार और बेसिकली होता क्या है कि कुछ जुगाड़ वाले स्मार्टफोन होते हैं या फिर कुछ गलत होता है ना स्मार्टफोन के अंदर तो उसमें सबसे पहली चीज हम टेस्ट करते हैं बैंकिंग ऐप चल रही है कि नहीं क्योंकि अगर आपने रूट कर लिया स्मार्टफोन या कुछ होता है ना तो बैंकिंग आप के आपकी चलनी बंद हो जाती है तो बैंकिंग एप्स परफेक्टली फाइन चल रही थी हमने डाली इंस्टॉल करी उसमें कोई भी दिक्कत नहीं आई उसके साथ हमने फिंगरप्रिंट स्कैनर चेक करा कि कहीं हार्डवेयर में दिक्कत तो नहीं है कुछ निकाल विकाल तो नहीं दिया फिंगरप्रिंट स्कैनर भी बढ़िया चल रहा था ओवरऑल पहली झलक में हम रोज स्मार्टफोंस रिव्यू करते हैं और हमको भी पहली झलक में हल्का सा धोखा हो रहा है बट बहुत छोटी-छोटी चीजें हैं जिस वजह से इस स्मार्टफोन को आपको बिल्कुल नहीं लेना चाहिए मैं बताता हूं सबसे पहली चीज जो हमने डब्बा खोला था आपने एक चीज अगर नोटिस करी हो इस डब्बे में कहीं पे भी सील नहीं है इसका मतलब इस स्मार्टफोन को पहले से खोला गया और तरीके से वापस बंद कर दिया गया ताकि किसी को पता ना चले वो पूरा अपना स्टीकर वकर होता वो नॉर्मल जैसा होता है वैसा एग्जैक्ट सेम टू सेम लगा दिया गया था अब दूसरी चीज जो हमने आपको बताई थी ये इंडिया के स्मार्टफोन का चार्जर नहीं है इसका प्लग पॉइंट बहुत डिफरेंट है इस टाइप के चार्जर्स इंडिया में one प नहीं देता है तो ये छोटी-छोटी चीजें हैं जो समझ में आ रही है अब स्मार्टफोन को खोला गया है तो इस स्मार्टफोन में कुछ तो करा होआ नीचे की तरफ भी क्या हो कि क्या सीन है भाई का क्योंकि मैं इसलिए नहीं जाता यार क्योंकि मेरे को लोग पहचानते हैं सचन जब पहुंचता है सर्विस सेंटर के ऊपर वो बताता है कि भाई यह हमको स्मार्टफोन को रिपेयर करवाना है आप प्लीज बताओ कैसे करा सकते हैं एंड वो पूछता है कि भाई स्मार्टफोन को रिपेयर कराना है सामने से आंसर आता है कि यह वाला स्मार्टफोन one प का है ही नहीं ये फोन लिया था इसमें काफी लैग आ रहा हैर सब कु तो अन से लिया तो मेरे को लगा सही होगा तो इसमें दिक्कत क्या हैन वाले बन में सेलर र अच्छा अपने दुकान का माल में सेलर जो है से लेके आके आपको मतलब सबसे ज्यादा कन्फ्यूजिंग पॉइंट है हमारे लिए क्योंकि हर जगह oneplus8 सेलर से ये स्मार्टफोन लिया है एंड ये एक्चुअल oneplus8 आधार कार्ड जैसा होता है ये वो अपने सर्वर में डाल के चेक करते हैं कि भाई ये एक्चुअल को रिफर्बिशिंग के सर्वर में ये आईएमआई कोड इनवैलिड दिखाता है इसका मतलब [संगीत] और उनका कहने का मतलब कि हमने चेक करा डिस्प्ले एक 720p डिस्प्ले 000 में 720p डिस्प्ले नहीं आता अगर आता भी है तो 120 हर्ज वाला आता है इसमें एलसीडी 720p डिस्प्ले जिसकी क्वालिटी अच्छी नहीं है और ये 60 हज पे चल रहा है 60 हज पे मतलब आपको हल्का-फुल्का फ्रेम ड्रॉप दिखेगा इसके अंदर एंड डिस्प्ले इस प्राइस पॉइंट पे इससे एटलीस्ट टू टाइम्स बेटर डिस्प्ले से आराम से मिल जाते हैं उसके साथ-साथ हमने इसकी सेटिंग्स खोली तो भाई ऑनलाइन तो लिख रखा था कहीं पे होने वाला है भाई के अंदर बट हम जब अबाउट डिवाइस में जाके खोलते हैं तो इसमें प्रोसेसर हम खोल के देखते हैं तो इसमें एक मीटेक का प्रोसेसर है मीटेक की कोई दिक्कत नहीं है भाई तगड़े तगड़े प्रोसेसर आते हैं बट इसमें यो g35 है ये प्रोसेसर आज से 4 साल पहले 2020 में निकला था एंड 1plus ने 2022 के अराउंड इस वाले स्मार्टफोन को लॉन्च करा था आज से 2 साल बाद ये वाला प्रोसेसर अब किसी भी स्मार्टफोन में नहीं आता एंड इवन ये फोन भी बंद हो चुका है ये फोन भी नहीं बिकता है इंडिया में भी जो स्मार्टफोंस लच हुए थे जिनमें यो का g35 था वो छह से ₹ 77000 के प्राइस पॉइंट पे थे कोई भी ₹1000000 के ऊपर का स्मार्टफोन हमने टेस्ट नहीं करा जिसमें h g35 था और परफॉर्मेंस में एक दो और चीजें जैसे इसमें ईएमएमसी स्टोरेज है अब तो ऑलमोस्ट सारे ही स्मार्टफोंस के अंदर यूएफएस स्टोरेज आने लगी है तो बेसिकली परफॉर्मेंस के मामले में 2 साल पीछे एंड सेम चीज इसके कैमरे के बारे में भी है क्योंकि ये इंडियन वेरिएंट नहीं है तो हमने जो फोटोस खींची इससे उसमें रेडिश टोन आ रही है अलग-अलग अजीब सी फोटोज आ रही है एंड वो इसलिए क्योंकि एक तो कैमरा 2 साल पुराना है और 2 साल में बहुत इंप्रूवमेंट हो गई कैमरे के अंदर स्पेशली जितनी भी कंपनीज है सब में और साथ-साथ ये इंडियन वेरिएंट नहीं है ये इंडिया के बाहर का वेरिएंट है तो इसलिए जो बाहर वाले चेहरे हैं उनके हिसाब से ऑप्टिमाइज्ड है oneplus8 वाला ये खोल के देखा तो मेरे को इसमें समझ में आया कि भाई ये यूरोप लिखा है यूएसए लिखा है और इसके डब्बे के पीछे भी यूके प्राइमरी लिख रखा है तो इसका मतलब ये वाला स्मार्टफोन इंडिया के लिए नहीं बनाया गया एंड उसमें कोई दिक्कत नहीं है हमने इसको और थोड़ा सा चेक करा इस स्मार्टफोन के डब्बे को इसलिए खोला गया था ताकि इसका बूट लोडर अनलॉक कर पाए अभी सुनने में थोड़ा अजीब लगेगा भाई बूट लोडर क्या होता ये पीछे डिक्की खोल दी भाई नहीं मैं बताता हूं भाई का इसके अंदर होता क्या है जैसे अलग-अलग कंट्रीज होती हैं एंड अलग-अलग कंट्रीज में अलग-अलग ये डेटा प्रोवाइडर होते हैं जैसे इंडिया में यूके का स्मार्टफोन आप इंडिया में यूज़ कर पाओगे तो उसकी वारंटी खत्म हो जाती है और बूट लोडर अनलॉक करने का मतलब यह है कि इसके अंदर की जो फाइल्स हैं जो इसकी सिस्टम की फाइल्स हैं उनके साथ छेड़छाड़ करी जा सकती है हो सकता है सिस्टम में कोई ऐसी फाइल डाल दी गई जो इस फोन का डाटा कहीं बाहर भेज रही है एंड आपको पता भी नहीं चलेगा इसको पता करने का तरीका बहुत ज्यादा मुश्किल है बट यह हमको कंफर्म्ड है कि इस फोन के सॉफ्टवेयर के साथ छेड़छाड़ करी गई है इस फोन के बूट लोडर को अनलॉक करा गया है और और इस फोन को अनलॉक करने के बाद इसकी वारंटी इसीलिए खत्म हो जाती है क्योंकि भाई आप स्मार्टफोन के अंदर की चीजों का अगर छेड़छाड़ कर दो तो कंपनी कैसे वारंटी देगी उसकी तो अगर आप इंटरनेशनल भी लेके जाते हो स्मार्टफोन को तो वहां पे भी इसकी वारंटी आप क्लेम नहीं कर सकते वहां पे भी कोई बंदा इसको रिपेयर नहीं करेगा हमने इस वाले स्मार्टफोन को दो-तीन दिन यूज करके देखा बीज खोलने पे लैग कर रहा था गेम तो क्या ही चल रही थी कैमरे पे फोटोज अगर आप ले रहे हो तो उसमें लैग है 4k वीडियोस अगर मैं प्ले कर रहा हूं तो उसमें भाई पोर्ट्रेट से लैंडस्केप शिफ्ट होने में 3 सेकंड का डिले आता है 4k वीडियोस लैग होके प्ले होती हैं बेसिक जो काम है ईमेल भी रिप्लाई करना उसमें भी फ्रेम ड्रॉप्स हैं और ये सारी चीजें इसलिए क्योंकि आज भाई दुनिया आगे बढ़ चुकी है अब इस फोन का अगर मैं आपको पूरा सच बताऊं तो ये इंडिया में रिलीज नहीं हुआ ये 2 साल पुराना [संगीत] तो करा सकते हो एंड इस प्राइस पॉइंट पे तगड़े तगड़े स्मार्टफोंस अवेलेबल हैं मैं कुछ एग्जांपल्स अगर आपको बताऊं तो i का z9 l आता है redmi10.tk अगर एक स्क्रीन कार्ड खरीदना है या फिर एक केस खरीदना है तो वो सारी चीजें नहीं मिल पाएंगी इस वाले स्मार्टफोन के साथ तो मैं आपको एक बेसिक चीज बताऊं आप कोई भी स्मार्टफोन लेने अगर जा रहे हैं आपका इस टाइप से पोपट ना बनाया जाए उसको ऑफिशियल इंडिया वेबसाइट पे अगर आप चेक करेंगे तो आपको फोन लिस्टेड मिल जाएगा जितनी भी कंपनीज हैं अपनी वेबसाइट के ऊपर अपने स्मार्टफोंस को लिस्ट करती हैं स्पेशली इंडिया वेबसाइट के ऊपर अगर आपको दिखता है कि भाई इंडिया वाली वेबसाइट पे लिस्टेड नहीं है तो आप उसको अवॉइड ही करिए और कोई भी स्मार्टफोन आता है तो आपको मैक्सिमम लोग रिव्यू करते हुए मिल जाएंगे हम भी ऑलमोस्ट सारे स्मार्ट फ्स का रिव्यू करते हैं एंड अगर किसी ने भी उसका रिव्यू नहीं डाला तो आप समझ जाओ भाई कुछ चीजें जो टू गुड टू बी ट्रू होती हैं वो झूठी होती है तो ये वाला स्मार्टफोन बेसिकली एक लूप होल है एक सीक्रेट दरवाजा है जिसका लोग इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं इसमें oneplus8 हैं उनकी भी मुझे गलती नहीं लगती क्योंकि भाई वो भी तो एक्चुअल ओरिजिनल स्मार्टफोन ही बेच रहे हैं एंड उनकी वेबसाइट पे लिखा भी है कि भाई इसका बूट लोडर अनलॉक्ड है सारी चीजें बट मेरे हिसाब से ये एक छोटा सा गैप है मार्केट में जो जो कंज्यूमर्स को बहुत ज्यादा नुकसान दे सकता है मेरे हिसाब से भाई इसका सॉल्यूशन क्या होगा ये मुझे एगजैक्टली नहीं पता है बट मुझे यह पता है कि आप लोगों को इस टाइप के स्मार्टफोन से बच के रहना चाहिए क्योंकि अगर आपने ये स्मार्टफोंस ले लिए तो आपका बहुत ज्यादा नुकसान हो सकता है फ्यूचर में हो सकता है फोन चलना बंद हो जाए वारंटी नहीं मिलेगी अपडेट्स में दिक्कत आ सकती है और हम चाहते हैं कि भाई आप ऐसी दिक्कतों से बचे रहे और इसीलिए हम इस टाइप की वीडियोस बनाते हैं आई होप आपको वीडियो पसंद आई हो आप बता सकते हैं भाई कमेंट्स में हम और क्या-क्या नेक्स्ट लेवल चीजें करें एंड हम मिलते हैं आपसे नेक्स्ट वी बाय बाय

I'm Caroline Steel. This is the BBC World Service. And welcome to The Engineers. This year we're at the Science Specialist
University, Imperial College London. And we're here to focus
on the technical revolution defining our era, artificial intelligence. I'm joined by a panel of three world
leaders in the field and a large, enthusiastic audience in Imperial's
Great Hall. Already a computer can defeat the world's greatest player at our most complex
strategy game. The first movie written entirely by AI has just been released,
and AI may have discovered our first antibiotic in three decades. Together
with our partners, Royal Commission 1851, we've brought together three engineers
at the cutting edge of this field to discuss their work
and what it means for us humans. Paolo Pirjanian is Armenian, but he was born in Iran
and started his career working on Mars rovers for NASA. He's now founder and CEO of Embodied,
which is a company that builds emotionally intelligent robots
to help with child development. David Silver is from the UK, where he's
principal research scientist at the AI Research Lab. Google DeepMind. He led the team that used AI to defeat the world's best player
at the complicated strategy game Go. And he's working on artificial general
intelligence. Regina Barzilay is Israeli-American
and a distinguished professor for AI and Health at MIT in the U.S. She created a major breakthrough
in detecting early stage breast cancer and also led the team that used AI to discover what is hoped to be
a brand new antibiotic. So please do join me in
welcoming them all. Regina, let's start with you. So what is it that made
you shift your work to oncology? Sadly, you were in the perfect position
to do that, weren't you? Yeah. So actually,
I started my work at MIT in 2003 as a faculty and I was working on
natural language processing and AI And in 2014,
I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I was treated
in one of the best hospitals in the United States,
Massachusetts General Hospital. And what I discovered going through
the treatment that there was really no AI or not even basic information technology
as part of the treatment. Neither the diagnostics
nor the treatment nor the post-treatment. And, you know, after I was treated,
I just was totally confused as to what I want to do, because it was the first time
I realised that, you know, my life is finite and I've seen a lot of very sick people
there surrounding me. And I was thinking, What can I do? And MGH -  this hospital at MIT - 
is just one subway stop away, they are separated by a bridge I’m saying, how come we have
all this great technology at MIT, but none of it is actually coming
to the hospitals and helping patients. So after I finished my treatment,
I still didn't have my hair. I started kind of going from doctor to doctor, asking them, you know, how
I can bring AI -  I will do it for free. I'm a professor. So there were not many takers,
but eventually we found somebody who... it was
a doctor called Connie Lehman who had the idea that we can apply AI to do early detection of cancer. Thank you, Regina. David,
you came to AI via the games industry and you did a PhD in reinforcement
learning. What is reinforcement learning and
how did you use it in those early days? Yeah. So I guess I started out in the games
industry before I went back to academia and I was working
on building computer games. And as a big part of building
computer games is building the AI for those games, that kind of makes
all of the characters move around. And I found myself
being fundamentally disappointed by the methods that were being used
in those games. And it felt like what I really wanted to do was build
something that had real AI in it. I discovered this idea of reinforcement
learning, which is basically a method very much like those that animals
and humans use, where the system is able to learn
for itself from experience, from trial and error, from trying things out
and seeing what works and what doesn't. So is it sort of like when we learn to not touch fire because at some point
we try it and it really hurts and we learn don't do that in the future
because the consequences aren't appealing. Is it sort of like how humans
learn reinforcement learning? Yes, it's a lot like that.  So in fact humans are believed to have,
you know, a major part of the brain which is devoted to providing a signal,
giving feedback that that makes the brain actually learn to do more of the good things
and less of the bad things. And so actually, that's inspired
a lot of work in machine learning to make machines
have that same capability. But a machine doesn't feel heat
or isn't rewarded by a cookie. How can you reward a machine?  Yeah, so for a machine, it's just a number. So you give it a positive number if it's done something good
and a negative number if it's done something bad. And at the end of the day,
everything stems from that one single number. So this one single number,
which we call the reward, contains enormous power because it's the signal
that drives everything. Paolo, you said your experiences of feeling alienated in foreign countries made
you want to create an imaginary friend. And I'm sure much of our audience
can relate to having an imaginary friend, but for most of us, they stay imaginary. How did you go about making a real one? So unfortunately, there's a lot of people in need of companionship or therapy, and there's a massive gap of labour force that can provide us, as an example,
to use numbers from the U.S. We know the prevalence of things
such as autism is growing rapidly. Ten years ago
it was one out of about 200 kids. Today, it's one out of about 30 kids. So the experiences I had,
which was leaving my family at a very young age,
living abroad in a society that's amazing. I mean, these are amazing people, but yet you are different,
so you are not going to be embraced. So this is not too dissimilar
from a child on the autism spectrum that has a hard time expressing themselves
or reading emotions from other people. And that was the genesis of creating
a robot companion that understands human emotions,
can create a deep relationship with a child, and it'll help them
exercise and practice social skills such as eye contact,
turn-taking, joint attention and so on, so that the child has a chance
of being successful in their society. Thank you. Regina, what can AI do when it comes to understanding
cancer that humans can't? So I think
that in cancer and in many other diseases, a big question is always,
how do you deal with uncertainty? And unfortunately, today we rely on humans
who don't have this capacity to make predictions. And as a result, many times
people get wrong treatments or they are diagnosed much later. And one question that really troubled me
is, you know, how late I was diagnosed and when we already developed a model,
I came back to my own mammograms and rediscovered the mammograms
two years earlier already had on a tiny small cancer. Now, for human eye, for radiologists, it's impossible to diagnose it
because it's so, so confusing. There's
so many other spots on your tissue. So what AI can do, it can do a lot of tasks
which humans cannot do. Take all the data that we have and remove the guessing
out of diagnosis and treatment. Thank you.  David, AI had already defeated the reigning
grandmaster, Garry Kasparov, at chess well before you started your project AlphaGo and the rules of Go
sound quite simple. Basically, on each turn,
a player puts down a counter on the board and you gain territory
by connecting your counters and the player with the most territory
at the end of the game wins. So why is it harder for a computer
to beat a human at Go than at chess? Which sounds more complicated. So the game of Go
is this very beautiful and elegant game where it seems at first glance
like the rules are very simple. But once you start to understand it
a bit like unpeeling an onion, you discover more
and more layers of complexity and what's amazing is that when humans
play this game, they basically... If you ask them to describe how they did
something, they really don't know. They've used incredible intuition. And so these amazing professional players
who've devoted their entire lives to this game have built this incredible
intuition and creativity and intuition and creativity
are two traits which were previously considered to be very human
and very hard to build into machines. So while chess, it was possible to succeed
just with tactical look ahead in the game of Go, that wasn't enough
because, you know, early on in the game you just have this handful of stones
on the board and you really just have to imagine what the game will pan out like,
you know, 300 moves later with this sort of intuitive sense
of where it will go. And that required some
some major breakthroughs. Paolo, debatably even more complex
than Go is human children. Your human centred robot forms
an emotional bond with children. How can a robot do that? Well, first of all, it's important to make clear that the robot is not meant
to replace the need for human contact. It's really almost like training
wheels to teach children the social skills and then be able to practice
those in real life. The way the robot forms bond is that humans are wired to bonding. We create connections with inanimate objects all the time. I mean, with a robot
that has eyes, can make eye contact, can smile back at you and can speak to you
and express emotion and empathy. It's actually not that hard
to create a bond there. And children open up to to these robots
very quickly in ways that they may not even open up
to their therapists or parents. Thank you, Paolo. Regina, you not only made an impact
on oncology, your team at MIT used AI to discover what could be our first new antibiotic in three decades. It seems it can be E. Coli, MRSA,
and strains of bacteria which are currently resistant
to all other antibiotics. So I think we all wish it success. How did you do that? So I should say that, you know, developing
antibiotics is not an area with an immense competition,
even though their resistance to to antibiotics
that we have continues to grow. This happened to be an area
where pharmaceutical companies are not very active because economically
it doesn't work for them. So in some ways we do need to have
alternative approaches. I met a colleague and he was working. He was from biological engineering,
he was working on antibiotics. And he was describing the big problem
of finding new molecules which are effective against bacteria, drug
resistant bacteria. But at the same time, are not toxic to humans. They have some molecules screened against,
I think E.coli. We started with that and then we just gave to the machine,
you know, thousands of molecules. And for each molecule you knew
whether it kills a bacteria or not. It was kind of the first attempt
to learn automatically. How do you look at the structure of the molecule and predict
whether it would have a desired effect? We found a molecule that didn't look like
something human created. And it turns out in the lab
that it was able to kill using a different mechanism of action,
kill it in a different way. And that's what made it so effective
against so many different species. David, let's go back to you. So, so far we've been talking
about systems designed to perform one task - that's known as narrow AI, but you're working towards
artificial general intelligence. Could you explain
what artificial general intelligence is? So if you think about humans
and human intelligence, it's this wonderful and beautiful thing
where we're able to learn skills which are incredibly diverse, where, you know, one person might choose to 
specialise in learning how to play tennis and another person might specialise in becoming an amazing chef
and another person, a pianist and another person, a scientist
and so when we want to build artificial intelligence, we want systems
which not only solve a single problem but in a similar manner to humans,
are able to approach any number of problems
with intelligence, and that's capable of doing amazing things
in each of those different areas. And that's what we refer to as artificial
general intelligence or AGI for short. And how far off do you think we are from
that being a reality? So I think it's going to be a spectrum
over many years. And I also think it's likely 
or at least plausible that there are many breakthroughs
that are still required before we can really crack,
you know, the same kind of level of intelligence that humans have. Regina, you've developed
AI to better predict cancer, but it's only employed
in a tiny number of cases, right? Why is AI not used
more widely in medicine? The problem is that
we're creating a lot of great technology, but this technology is
not really translated into patient care. And if I would ask the audience, you know,
how many of you when you last saw your physician,
have you actually seen any AI, and I'm sure not
many can really attest to it. So I think the technology for many of the tasks
is really mature, but there are many other questions
which have nothing to do with AI per se. One is the regulation or regulations,
in Europe, UK, US - continue to change. Another big problem is people
don't really know how to bill for AI. And today the American doctor
who uses AI loses money when they see a patient. So it's not much of a motivation. So just to clarify that, did
you say that using AI for doctors in the US could actually make them lose money
because it makes treatment more effective? I'm referring
to a specific paper. The way the billing is done it somehow relates to the time
the doctor spends with a patient. So if you have something that makes
it faster, you're actually losing money. Very depressing. And Paolo, what about your challenges? The robot you've developed
mimics human behaviour. What's next? I'm very
hopeful with what we are doing in terms of creating social emotional AI systems that can help humanity become its best. If we can intervene early with children
for instance on the autism spectrum, they have a chance of really integrating
well with the society and doing really well. When we think about other vulnerable areas of our life is when we age. Social isolation, being lonely,
and that leads to mental health issues, that leads
to physical health issues and so on. We can have the same systems
become a companion that help you there. Once we figure out the physical task, you can also imagine
that they can give you assistive care, meaning that they can be not only 
a social emotional companion for you, but they can also be a companion
and say, let's cook some food together, let's go for a walk together
and so on, which is going to help a lot with independent
living with dignity when we are at that age. Do you think we'll see robots
helping with assistive care in the future any time soon,
or is this way off in the distance? I think it is within the next decade. Oh wow. David, you're working on Gemini,
which is Google's answer to ChatGPT, and you aim for it to be able to do
both tax returns and write a novel. People would probably be very happy
to have their tax returns done or I would definitely would be. But novels, should we really be letting
AI sort of take over human culture? So it's a great question. I think I wouldn't see it as taking over
human culture. I think what will happen, or
the most likely outcome, is that we'll be providing an incredibly powerful tool
to human authors. So we've already seen this
in a number of areas where we've developed technologies
that enable authors of different kinds of media to basically create things
much more powerfully using tools. So, for example, there's a music
authoring system called Lyria that was released recently,
and there's this wonderful footage of Will.i.am when he's playing with it
for the first time. And he's just so excited
because he says it can kind of speed up his songwriting process
by, you know, 10 to 100 times. So I think, you know what I really hope
we get to is a world in which the AI and the humans kind of work together
to just make everything better. So, you know, I'm excited to be in a world
where we have much more... the most amazing novels
that we can imagine, that which go far beyond the ones
we have today. Thank you, David. Thank you. This is The Engineers - Intelligent
Machines from the BBC World Service. We've discussed medical AI,
emotionally intelligent robots, the goal of artificial general intelligence
and the threats AI might pose. Has anyone got a question
on anything we've discussed so far? Wow. Okay. Pretty much everyone has a hand up,
so this is going to be tricky. Could we start
with the man in the red shirt? If you could stand up and say your name
and your question. Thank you very much. Hello, my name's Simon. The British
government wants to make Britain a leader in AI and sees the way to do this
by making it a safe space. They're looking at doing that
by making sure you can't develop AI where you don't understand
the consequences before you develop it. Does the panel think that's the right
approach? So, yes. David, what do you think about legislation
around AI? I think we need some kind of regulation. I think it's, you know, an area
which clearly is going to have more and more consequence
and impacts on society. So I think regulation is important. I think some of the areas
which have been agreed in various summits over the last year -  
you know, fantastic start. One thing I would say
is I think it's hard sometimes to come up with like a one size
fits all recipe for AI because it's
so different in different areas. So you know, the regulation
that you might need in medicine might look quite different to the kind of regulation
you might need for, say, a chatbot. So I think, you know,
we have to look at each area separately and make sure that whatever we do,
you know, we really fully understand the consequences of what
the impact of AI will be in that area. There's a lot of anxiety about the pace AI is moving, right? We have people resigning, leaders
in the field to campaign for more safeguarding
against the threat of misinformation, the threat to jobs,
and even an existential risk to humanity. Regina?  I actually feel quite opposite. People are really suffering.
There are lots of incurable diseases. It's hard for patients, it's hard
for their families. There is a lot of technologies
that is out there and because we cannot get together
to put the regulation in place, make, you know, the payers take part of it
and find a way to bring it I think we are really making many,
many people suffer. Thank you. Paolo, what about robots? Are they going to take all our jobs? Yes. Yes. Okay, great. We've got it. We finally have
an answer. Thank you, Paolo. On a serious
note, I feel it's a bit of a conundrum to think about legislation,
because on one hand, yes, there are definitely risks
and you would like to regulate it so that no one with bad intentions
goes wild. On the other hand,
if you think about it, it's an extremely potent technology. It could change everything in our lives including being strategically important technology to master from a national perspective. And from that perspective,
if you regulate it, let's say part of
the regulation is slowing it down, what are our adversaries going to do? Are they going to
then have an advantage over us? So it's a bit of an arms race. And I think for that reason, practically speaking,
I think it's going to be very hard to regulate it to that
level unless you can have international regulation and agreement across all the powerful nations to say
this is how we're going to handle it. And I haven't seen that work out very well
in the history of time. Fair enough. Audience, we have time for a couple more questions. So hands up. If we could go to the man
in the white top. Thank you. Hello, panel. My name's Rob. And I'm a business and sports coach. And I'm wondering
whether what you've been talking about is possible for helping humans
to improve their performance at a sport. Good question. Who's our greatest sport enthusiast? Perhaps this one is for you, David. Can we be using AI to improve sports
performance? It's a great question. There's a lot of really amazing research
that's happening to try and do just that. You know, one thing which we've been doing
at Google DeepMind is actually a collaboration with Liverpool Football
Club to try and help them improve their tactics. So that's one example. I think, you know, the amazing thing
about sports is it's become over time so refined in terms of the particular
approaches that people take that actually,
you know, really they're very open to new discoveries
and new ways to do things. And so it's been really fun actually,
just watching that kind of thing unfold. Very cool. Thank you, David. I can see we've got lots of young people
in the audience, some teenagers even. Does any of our younger audience
have a question? If so stick your hand up. There was a young lady
who had a hand up here with a ponytail. Yes. As AI develops, I reckon that humans probably depend more on AI
and maybe learn less. Is there anything we could do to
maybe make sure that as it develops, humans still develop and learn? Ooh, good question. So will we stop learning, as
AI does the learning instead for us? I'm going to put that to all of you if that's all right. What do you think, David? I'd like
to imagine a world where we have an AGI which is like a personal friend,
assistant teacher, and everything we do understands
what we want to learn, and it knows just how to teach us and help us
to learn more and more and more and more. Regina, what do you think? Do you think we're just going to end up
relying on AI for everything?  As a non-native speaker of English I remember as a young professor
I spent a humongous amount of time like reading my papers and making sure,
you know, because in my native language we don't have and so I make a lot of mistakes
when I write. I see now how I write papers. Actually,
it removes a lot of my pressure in writing and I can really focus on ideas
rather than doing the small things. So I hope that we will find a symbiosis. We don't really,
you know, remove our basic skills, but we can just do more and focus
on the things that we can do better. I would like to imagine
if Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein had access to these tools today,
I mean, as prolific as they were at a time
where we didn't even have calculators, imagine what they would have done and
the impact it would have had on the world if they had access to these tools. In the next five years potentially, you don't need to code. You will just tell your favourite AI system
and say I want a code that does x, y, z and you can accomplish what would
take years of many people in hours today. So it will make you more prolific. Thank you. I think it's fair to say all three of you
have given us hope for the future. Audience, thank you so much for your questions. I wish we could take more,
but I'm afraid we're out of time. That's it for The Engineers -  Intelligent Machines
at Imperial College, London. I'm Caroline Steel. On behalf of the BBC World Service our partners the Royal Commission for the Exhibition
of 1851 and my producer, Charlie Taylor. Please join me in giving a warm round
of applause for our brilliant pioneering AI engineers Regina
Barzilay, Paolo Pirjanian and David Silver"

This phone comes under Rs 15K & the price range between Rs 10K-15K is very interesting. And there are times when 1-2 features are good & some are not. You don't get a balanced phone. And according to me, the M7 Pro is a balanced phone under Rs 15K. And I'm saying this because if you talk about the display, performance & camera, everything has been looked at. So this comes out as a balanced phone. Watch the full video & you'll know. We'll also talk about the C75 but let's open the M7 Pro. Poco M7 Pro box, black letters, sim card tool, documentation & it's not a clear case. It's an opaque & good quality case. Poco's branding is here. This is the phone & let's talk about it. The 45W charger comes inside the box & that's nice. You get good phones in this price range but if you don't get a charger in the box, you'll have to spend Rs 1-2K for it. And then you have USB Type A to Type C charging cable. That's about it, let's look at the phone. It's very interesting when you unbox a new phone. But every time you open the box, you're expecting something new. Look at the design, it's wavy & shiny. And then you get a matte finish here. It looks very different but I like it. It's written 5G on the bottom & Poco's camera model branding. It's very nice with flat sides. It has a screen guard of 189mm. Let's remove it & listen to the sound. Oh yes, I like this! Alright, let's keep the phone. Let's keep the phone. It's 189.8g. I'm going off from the last few unboxings as there's a difference of 7-8g. I said it's 188-189g & it's exactly that. This lavender colour feels nice. The in hand feel of the phone is good. If I talk about the ports & buttons, there's a sim card tray at the bottom. There's a USB Type C port, a microphone & a speaker grill. There's a power on & off button on the right. Interestingly, there's an in display fingerprint sensor. There's a volume rocker at the top & it's busy. There's a 3.5mm jack at the top. It's a rare commodity but it's there. There's a speaker grill, an IR blaster & a noise cancelling microphone. It's very nice. If I talk about the sim card tray, there's a hybrid sim card slot. You can use 1 sim card & 1 SD card or 2 sim cards. If I talk about the protection, there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Let's drop it. Obviously! 1,2 & Bounce! There's nothing. 1 more, 1,2 Oh! No, no, no. There's nothing. Let's look at it from the outside & inside. It has a flat display. Display is very important. You interact with the display & it's display is good. In this price range, it's under Rs 15K. With offers, it's under Rs 15K. The display is 6.67'' with 120Hz FHD+. And it's a G OLED display with 92% screen-to-body ratio. In this price range, it has the brightest display with 2100 nits. So when you go out & you're viewing something, there shouldn't be any problems. If I talk about the display, the colours are very good. Look at that! The bezels on the sides are thin. The chin is of average size. But overall, it's a nice & punchy display. So for multimedia, you'll definitely enjoy it. Let's talk about the multimedia here. We've seen that it gives HDR on Netflix, but we're not sure. Sometimes it doesn't give it on YouTube, but yes, it shows. So that's excellent. If I talk about the speakers, you get stereo speakers. Even the video viewing experience is excellent. The viewing angles are good. Don't do it, but there's a feature for audio in the multimedia. You can amplify the sound by 300%. If you want a loud sound, you can do that as well. So that's very nice. So in terms of the display, it's definitely good. Let's talk about the specifications. It comes on Dimensity 7025 Ultra. And it's Antutu score is close to 5 Lakhs. It's around 4.85-4.95 Lakhs. The base variant is 6GB RAM & 128GB storage. It has UFS 2.2 storage, LPDDR4X RAM. It has a 5110mAh battery & supports 45W charging. As I said, the display is good & it's 120Hz. So you enjoy playing on this flat display. We did long gaming sessions. In terms of stability, we got 86-87% CPU stability score. It wasn't too hot, so thermals are also in check. Overall, in terms of performance, it's quite decent. And the thermals are in check because it has a 7820mm2 vapour cooling chamber. So the thermals are amazing. Let's talk about the OS. It comes with HyperOS & it's based on Android 14. But POCO has said that you'll get 2 years of major updates & 4 years of security updates. If I talk about the OS, you get pre-installed apps which you can uninstall. In fact, you can disable system apps as well. If I talk about the features, you get Xiaomi's own dialer. So if you want to record a call, you don't have to do it. If I talk about the sensors, you get an in-display fingerprint sensor, face unlock, etc. And everything works well. If I talk about connectivity, you get 7 5G bands. And yes, it's standalone. It supports SA & NSA. So if you're on Airtel, Jio or any other network, you shouldn't have any problems. You get dual band WiFi, Bluetooth 5.3 & IR Blaster. There's no NFC support. Another important thing is the display performance & then comes the camera. You don't get good cameras under Rs 15K. You get soft photos. It doesn't have ultrawide, but the primary sensor is Sony's 50MP LYT600. And it supports OIS. So the primary sensor is quite good. The photos that we took, it maintains clarity & details. The colours are good & the dynamic range is good. We don't expect under Rs 15K. If we take 10 photos, they'll definitely come out good in 7-8 HDR. 2-3 photos are hit & miss, which is really good. If we talk about selfies, you get a 20MP selfie sensor. And selfies are actually amazing! Yes, the skin tones are good, the colours are on point. We've taken a lot of photos & videos. If you want to see the original quality, do check out the G-Drive link. If we talk about camera features, you get a 50MP native photo. You get video, photo, portrait mode, night mode. If I talk about the pro mode, you get shutter speed, ISO, panorama, slow motion, time lapse, AI watermark. So all that is there. And the photos are decent in low light too. There's a reason. Because it has the lowest aperture in this segment. F1.5 means there's more light on the camera sensor. Because of which the photos are good even in low light. And yes, you get AI too. You can zoom in & out the portraits. It keeps all the details in the photos decently. That's why when I started this video, I said that it's a balanced phone. So I can't nitpick which is good & which is bad. It's not like it's great in some cases & not so good in others. Everything is quite balanced. And if I talk about the other features, you get IP64. In this price range, you get IP52 & IP62. But this has IP64. SAR value is within limits. You get FM radio support, 3.5mm jack, IR blaster, noise cancelling microphone. So again, it has all the important features. Let's talk about its smaller brother, C75. Overall, due to 4s Gen 2, its performance is good. To keep the price below Rs 8K, they've launched the 464 & 4128 variants. It has a 50MP primary sensor. In both the variants, you get a 2MP secondary sensor. But if I talk about the display, you get a bigger 6.88'' display. But that's an HD plus display & a water drop notch. Obviously, if it's below Rs 8K, then that's fine. But the good thing is, you get HyperOS in this as well. You get major updates for 2 years & security updates for 4 years. So that's nice. It has a 5160mAh battery, supports 18W charging, there's a 3.5mm charger inside the box. So again, for that price range, it's a decent offering. It supports 5G stand alone. So if you're on Jio's network, it's going to work well. In fact, they've worked with Jio, so C75 is good. But the base variant which is below Rs 8K is the 464 & 4128. So overall, if you're looking for a phone below Rs 15K & you want a balanced phone. You don't just want to do gaming or only photos are important. If you want a balanced phone, then I'd say it's definitely in the top 3 for Rs 10-15K. And for a balanced phone, it's probably in the top 1-2. So that's a good offering from POCO. We've made this video in collaboration with POCO. But what we think, what we test & what results we get, that's what we clearly tell you in the video. Nothing else! It launches on the 17th & will be available on Flipkart on the 20th. That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"

I wasn't expecting this much but when we tested it, I was pleasantly surprised. If you hold the phone in your hand, it doesn't feel like it's a 1st generation product. Seriously, good job Infinix! I'm going to say this earlier because when we test a device, there's an expectation. And when it goes beyond that expectation, you feel good & that's what Zero Flip is. And there are some things that I'm going to tell you about it. Watch it carefully till the end. You'll come to know everything about this. This is the most affordable flip phone. It's net effective price is Rs 45K. That means flip phones have been democratised. If it comes below Rs 50K, it means it's a mass appeal phone & it's a flip phone. So yeah, that's it. Let's start with the Zero Flip phone. It has boxes, which is good because sometimes there's only 1 thing in a big box. They give the 70W adapter, which is not bad. It's a USB Type A adapter. What else is there inside? I think this is the cable. There's a Type A to Type C charging cable & there's a case as well. So there's documentation, a sim card tool & then there's the case. Let's put the case aside & look at the phone. There are 2 colours, this is black & there's another pink colour. By the way, this is a glass metal sandwich design. This is also glass & this is metal. You can see the internal lines. It's nice to hold in hand. I actually like the hinge. You can open it with 1 hand. You can easily open it with your thumb as it's a flip phone. It's even easier with the thumb. It's not bad. The weight is 183g. Let's try 184-183g. It's 201.8g. It's 201g. But when I open it like this, it feels a little heavy on the front. That's why I thought it's so heavy. No, I still feel it's around 188-185g. Let's move on. There's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 at the front & Gorilla Glass 7 at the back. And obviously there's a UTG Ultra Thin Glass inside. Let's do this. No, nothing. I'm scared from the back. Oh, this is beautiful! I think they've put a scratch guard over the glass. And you can't take it out. You can take it out, but it'll reduce the weight by 1-2g. Let's remove this. There's a scratch guard. Oh, nice! Build Quality is absolutely great. Even if you look at the hinge & it's written Infinix on it, it looks premium. It feels like a sturdy phone in your hand. And definitely it's well built as well. So in terms of build quality & durability, it's definitely a thumbs up! Let's quickly put the case on & look at this. Even good job on the case! You can open it with just 1 hand. And you can hold it like this. I'll definitely say that Infinix hasn't cut the corners to make this flip phone. Ports & Buttons You get a sim card tray, USB Type C, speaker grill. On the right, there's a power on off button with fingerprint sensor & volume rocker. There's a noise cancelling microphone on the top & nothing on the left. There's only 1 variant of SIM card tray, 512, so even if you don't have an SD card, it's fine. There's a dual nano sim card slot. Let's start the phone now. If you're new to our channel, then do subscribe to our channel. We've done this video in collaboration with Infinix. But I'll tell you what I think about this phone in this video. First, let's talk about the cover display. It's the biggest cover display in this segment. It's a 3.64'' AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. It's a very useful display with panels. But you can actually add apps here. You can watch YouTube here. You can watch Instagram, our shots etc. Let's check out the audio. Not bad at all! You're going to get used to it. You can follow a lot of things on the screen. We've tried playing games on it. You can't add icons, but we've turned it around. We've installed Google Play Store here. And you can play games on it. You can actually play on this screen. For eg, there's BGMI. And look at this! The cover screen is not just for the name sake. You can keep pets here. Absolutely no problems! It has a close integration with Gemini. So if you want to converse with the AI on the screen, you can do it. The display inside is tall. It's a 6.9'' FHD+, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display. It means it has an adaptive refresh rate from 10Hz to 120Hz. So that's good. The colours & panel quality are excellent. And as mentioned before, it uses UTG. The crease is very less. If you can see this. If you use it a lot, it'll increase a bit. But when you buy a new one, the crease is very less. We've seen other phones with a lot of crease. The outer display is 1100 nits brightness & the inner display is 1400 nits brightness. And this is a zero gap hinge. So let's test the paper. Oh yeah! You can see, it's a single paper & this is a double paper. I'll keep it as a single paper. This is a strong hinge. If I talk about the hinge, Infinix has said that it'll last upto 4 lakh folds. So even if it's 2-3 lakh folds, you can use it for 4-5 years. So again, the durability & hinge are all good. Multimedia Displays are absolutely nice. You'll have a good video viewing experience. It's very tall, so you won't get the upper bands. Sometimes you'll get the black bands on the sides. But you're going to enjoy that. There are JBL tuned speakers, stereo speakers. You'll like the quality. Overall, the multimedia experience is decent. You'll get HDR support on YouTube & not on Netflix. You'll be able to do full HD streaming on Netflix. Performance This is not a performance oriented phone. But it has a Dimensity 8020 processor. It has LPDDR4X RAM & UFS 3.1 storage. And the AnTuTu score is around 7.8-7.9 lakhs. Which is decent. You can play 60FPS games on HDR & play upto 40FPS. But I liked that it has a big battery. It has a 4720mAh battery. You get a 4720mAh battery in many normal candy bar phones. But in this foldable phone, you get a 4720mAh battery. And it has 70W charging. So there are absolutely no problems. It doesn't support 10W reverse wireless charging. Performance This is not a gaming phone. But if you're going to play games on it continuously, it does heat up a bit. So it heats up a bit. But I have to say that the thermals are fine. And we saw that the CPU throttle score is around 65-70%. So that's ok. Variants It has 8GB RAM, 512GB storage & 8GB virtual RAM. Sensors It has a side mounted fingerprint sensor, face unlock & works well. Connectivity It has WiFi 6 & NFC support. All the prominent bands in India support it. No problems there at all. It has an Air Blaster 2, not an Air Blaster. UI One thing that you have to test in foldable & flipable phones is the optimization. How do you move from a large screen to a smaller screen when you shift? If something has opened, it has moved to this side. They have done a good job in optimizing. Again, it doesn't seem like a 1st generation product in terms of hardware & software. We didn't notice any bugs in the tests we did. Updates It comes with XOS 14.5 which is based on Android 14. It has 2 years of major updates & 3 years of security updates. It has AI features like AI Wallpaper Generator. It has Volex Voice Assistant which is integrated with Gemini. So it's a voice assistant, you can talk & converse with it. It will talk to you with love. It has features like AI Eraser for battery health. There's an AI charging assistant so all those features are there. Cameras It's an Infinix phone & we don't expect it but I was pleasantly surprised by it. There's a 50MP camera on the front & a 50MP selfie camera on the back. I don't know whether to call it a selfie camera or not as the rear camera is on the front. So there are 3 50MP cameras. If I talk about the quality of the photos, it's good with clarity & sharpness. The photos you take for social media are a bit punchy & warm. By default, the photos you take for processing are social media worthy. I won't say it's natural as people don't like it. But there are some punchy & warm tones. We've taken a lot of photos & I'm giving you the G-Drive link. So do check it out if you're planning to buy this phone. Interestingly, you can take photos with all the 4K cameras. You can take selfies with the front, back & the inner camera. But the front cameras give 4K at 30FPS & the inner camera gives 4K at 60FPS. That's interesting. There's another phone from Infinix that has a partnership with GoPro. The GoPro app is pre-installed. And if you have a GoPro, you can directly control it from here. So if you're into that. Features Because it's a flip phone, you can use it as a DV mode. Then you have AI Cam, Video Mode, Portrait Mode, Vlog Mode, Super Night Mode, Time Lapse, Slow Motion, Dual Video Mode, SkyShop, Long Exposure, AR Shot, Pro, Super Macro Mode, Panorama, Document Scanning, GoPro. Obviously you'll have to pair your GoPro & then you'll be able to use it. If you want to take a photo from here, you can do this & it'll click a picture. So it supports gestures too. Features It has FM Radio, there's no notification light. You can keep pets, there's AOD, you can customize it. And yes, there's no IP certification. There's a dual LED flash in selfie mode. So that's there, if you're taking a selfie in the dark. So friends, I really liked Infinix's Zero Flip in terms of durability. Even the cameras have improved. For the price, especially the net effective price of Rs 45K, you're getting a good decent flip phone. Yes, this is the Infinix Zero Flip. If you have any questions, do ask them in the comments. If you have anything else, please do let me know. That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"

[Music] aliens and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in about I don't know 20 miles or closer do you remember when I made that video and I spoke about that computer software that predict icted a particular event that was going to happen from the 3rd or the 4th of December onwards is this what they're talking about the situation in New Jersey with the uaps has gone from crazy to ridiculous what's occurred within the last few hours is madness I've got a few bits of footage I'm going to show you okay but I wanted to make this video um because there is a very Split Decision as to what and where these uaps are coming from are they man-made or are they Alien made right alien technology I don't think we can get the answers by asking who what where right maybe it's it's why are they here why New Jersey because maybe if we can find out why then maybe we could find out who right so if we were to ask ourself why why New Jersey okay there's two things that come to mind one is the most populated state in the whole of the United States per square mile the most populated state okay so if you're an if you're an alien and you wanted to observe us wouldn't that be a perfect location and not only that if these uaps if these aliens are coming from the ocean it's sat right next to the North Atlantic right so you pop up out of the water you come across you do a little bit of observation if if [ __ ] goes down you can quickly Escape go back underwater maybe this is the reason why these sightings AR really coming from Inland right they're also reaching up near the um the capital of the United States New York okay in the lagu is it the lagu uh LaGuardia Airport in LaGuardia Airport that I've got footage now of UFOs uaps over there they're spreading they're getting a little bit more cheeky right so this would tell me that if it was alien Tech this is a perfect perfect place but then if it's human Tech a lot of people saying that it's testing they're testing these new drone equipment out but would you really test that equipment brand new equipment over the most densely populated state in the whole of the United States cuz some people are saying that this is Elon Musk if these are drones the size of small cars especially when it's cold weather as well drones stay up in the air for a maximum of 20 minutes who's got good batteries well Elon Musk is invested a lot of money a lot of time a lot of dedication into you know making incredible batteries so I had a little look at it is Elon Musk doing anything to do with drones in 2017 Elon musk told the world he was certain that artificial intelligence would lead us to World War II his viral comments evokes visions of Terminators feet crushing apart of skulls robotic airplanes hunting down humans now however it appears musk has changed his mind in a series of recent posts on X mus has become um a vocal advocate for replacing man Jets like f F35 lightning 2 with drone swarms controlled by AI Hive mines Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinting at drone production Morgan Stanley here we go Morgan Stanley Tesla Inc drones is it me or are you seeing more breadcrumbs from Tesla's CE potentially connect Tesla Aviation basically he goes into shares if he gets involved with drones um aircrafts you know uh shares could go up to $1,000 I'm not too sure what do you think is it anything to do with Elon Musk I think it's a bit of a stretch if we're going that far um there was another one that I saw Joshua boner look into these companies andreil and pretto Dynamics big money and big moves within AI surveillance drone defense one is lucky Palmer former founder of oculus well sorry Paul mlui that was his name um that is his name he's a bit of an oddball him because he did create this virtual reality headset that was a oneoff apparently and apparently if you played this game and died in the game the headset would make you in real life Palmer lucky um defense company so what hell pman lucky def so he is actually the CEO of Palmer lucky death headset Palmer lucky made a VR headset that kills the user if they die in the game so this is the person that has started up this company he is the founder of this company so it looks like andil is creating a drone an AI operated drone there's also quite a fair bit of History regarding UFOs over in New Jersey then 2001 the Carterette UFO incident Carterette New Jersey and surrounding areas including New Jersey Turnpike uh multiple Witnesses including the law enforcement and truck drivers reported seeing a series of strange lights hovering over the New Jersey Turnpike for about 15 minutes the lights were in a v-shaped formation and did not make any sound the FAA and the local authorities could not explain the phenomenon and remains one of the most famous UFO cases in New Jersey the oneq reservoir incident Witnesses including police officers reported seeing a bright glowing object hovering over the the reservoir the object repeatedly

1800s during a wave of sightings of mysterious airships across the us there reports from New Jersey residents about seeing large cigar shaped crafts in the sky these incidents occurred before the uh the Advent of airplanes and sparked National curiosity UFOs at New Jersey Shore common reports include strange lights over the ocean triangular-shaped objects and unexplained hovering Crafts near popular beaches like Seaside Heights and Cape May some reports ongoing reports and modern sighting some reports have increased in recent years coinciding with the broader public interest of UFOs especially after the US government released dis classified information about the unidentified identified aerial phenomena the UAP New Jersey has an active communities of UFO enthusiasts and discuss sightings and theories so it's quite a hot place for uaps to hang out right and so again that argues for it to be alien Tech now also we've got technology called orcus that can basically fire a a signal or a beam of some sort and drop drones from the sky okay this is our defense mechanism for drones but apparently this frequency is just something we've we don't know about listen to this we had this report from the New Jersey State Police now admitting that they have revealed that unidentified drones are operating on a frequency that cannot be detected okay we can't detect the frequency we don't know amidst the state the the uh new JY um State Police we don't know what these things are new not just a frequen that we can't Jam but also undetectable in radar is there any military activity out straight ahead of us no uh we're not seeing anything uh I had another report at like 30,000 ft in the Eugene area we're not sure what it is yeah there's lots of moving out there 156 yet they're they're looking into it it's we're seeing three or four targets you know they're all altitudes up and down it's pretty crazy I there was some at 30 probably but I mean they're shooting way up I we say maybe up to the 50s it looks like is there traffic actually out about uh our 2 to 3:00 about I don't know 20 30 miles no is that that uh the four different lights going up and down I'm getting a few reports but uh you're seeing it right in front of you now to as well uh it's 2 to 3:00 off uh yeah about 2 to 3:00 from our position look about 20 miles going in [Applause] circles medac one yeah we're not seeing anything getting a lots of different reports out there uh some at 30 some all the way up to 50,000 about three four different lights does it look like they're around your altitude now uh no there's one way up high and one about my altitude um moving in like like a circle like a cork screw pattern all right I'm I'm um VIs Have Eyes on what looks like a aircraft strobe that's at my 2:00 and 22 mil at my uh altitude I'm actually showing him on TCAP do you see that one I do not he looks like he's U moving towards it looks like it's moving towards the north uh like I said 22 22 and half miles off my right wing just had another one show up about my uh 1:00 uh about 1,000 ft High zipping towards us and then back out towards the ocean red red in color um moving at extreme speeds I don't I don't even know how to describe that F Roger you are cleared to maneuver as necessary left or right to avoid the UFO out there it's weird it's a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in about I don't 20 mil or closer to us and it zips back out of the ocean and we can't see it is there military activity out straight ahead of us no uh we're not seeing anything uh I had another report at like 30,000 ft in the Eugene area we're not sure what it so he literally said there that these uaps are moving to and fro from the from the from the ocean to land back again moving back and forth bit like this video this is this is what I'm saying this has been going on for years and yes okay these are the these look different to what your stereotypical uaps look like right but this is this video I'm going to show you now this is from 1994 this is what's been happening for so many years we either being surrounded by Fring UFOs or the coast guards I want us s there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 lights we see there they've been coming on they were seven lives here is some live footage of uaps coming out or coming from the ocean okay in Island Beach State Park and not only that someone's actually managed to capture what looks like some portal of some sort in the sky right live cam on C bright Beach webcam this is what they're referring to some sort of portal opening up what this was captured live people are going be saying Tesa that's not that's not that's not Tesa rocket but what is that and here's an interesting video as well a lady is recording off of her balcony you actually see the scale of what's going on here but something crazy is going on in the sky it's not just the uaps take a look at this okay so for context this is what you're going to see in the next video this is the view off my balcony that is South Jersey that is Jersey City over here is New York City there is nothing in this area there's no stadiums no cities no Bridges nothing watch this Sky now down now I'm not too sure what's going on with the audio sounds like some sort of noise cancellation cancelling a voice or something like that but what sort of Direction so what did she say okay for context this is what you're going to see in the next video this is the view off my balcony that is South Jersey so that's South Jersey a look so so she must have been so New York here South Jersey so South Jersey she must have been out here right so she's looking pointing South Jersey and then to the left she looked at New York she seemed closer to New York either way New York was on the left New Jersey she pointed to on the right yeah so straight out there over the ocean was this weird light going on that is Jersey City okay Jersey City over here is New York City okay right along the river there right so this is this is what she this is where this is it she's got to be along here somewhere so she's looking right out now there is something here was there fireworks going on was there something cuz she is looking that way maybe I'm not too sure but definitely something strange what she's seeing like you know if that's her balcony she's seeing that view got a beautiful view by the way right she's seen that view a lot and obviously recorded this because it's not something that she's seen before quite strange Ury Park boardwalk beach cam drones launched from the ocean here we go these drones are coming from the ocean so I think what's happening is as time come goes on more and more evidence shows that these things are coming from the ocean and I know that Congress has spoken about that the Pentagon I think has maybe said that as well or suggested that in fact they're keeping the mouth shut more so but the more that the the people record and collect information the more we're discovering yeah these things are actually coming from the ocean Point Pleasant Beach two [Music] there two there ignore the uh light on the jetty that's two three four five that one above might be an airplane I don't know these are boats I guess there fishing boats coming in they're just kind of sitting there with their lights on and my what they're saying that's two drones there and there's two here this one bright one has been doing that and that's kind of all I see at the moment these boats are maybe hunting for drones too maybe but right there see those guys this is Point Pleasant Beach there's been some air traffic I I just had somebody up here that was was had somebody up here that was uh looking at some weather I not weather uh a flight app there's no airplanes around but man they are out tonight December 12th 2024 P Pleasant Beach I mean it's got way past the point now of people reporting these things in the air right because it's it's such a Hot Topic Talk of the Town no one's reporting these now they're just recording them and putting them up on Tik Tok here's new footage that has uh risen recently UAP drone emerges from the ocean in New Jersey now that I I don't know what this white thing is here is that a rocket launch like what is this bit here as well though right because this see this bit here this is what I saw on the other one here is this the same thing what is that looks like maybe maybe that's like a a ship or something out there now on yesterday's video I spoke a little bit about um what these drones are looking like when people are zooming in on them on a DSLR camera um what we saw was absolutely incredible some sort of interference maybe this is something to do with that frequency that can't be picked up on but this is probably the the clearest image you're going to see of this weird is it is it a force field is it some sort of just a a glitch interference I don't know but it's very clear take a look at this clear footage of drones UAP is captured in New Jersey morphing into plane this is a recent footage this is morphing into a plane e I mean is that is just that is that a like a a glitch because it's out of focus when it's trying to zoom in and the dsli is trying to work out it's just putting it into a big ball but now it's focusing because it's it's getting closer that's the more logical reason right but that you can't deny that is the New Jersy drone but that I mean I've seen blur I've got I've got four dlsr cameras right DS DSLR and I've zoomed in on lights and being out night uh photography and things like that I don't see blurs like this I've got to be honest with you I don't see blurs like this this is um East Brun switch in New Jersey this gentleman watch one of these just disappear this gentleman's recording outside of his car window one of these uaps just disappears right it either moves away extremely quickly or just disappears big part right holy [ __ ] where the hell the other one come from look how bright look how bright and big these things are are [ __ ] UFOs holy [ __ ] these just appearing I zoomed in [Music] on I [ __ ] notice at certain points as well these things go yellow right and we've seen many of these yellow orbs flying around have they always been these drone things can the have these drones got more capabilities than we we think they're hovering around New Jersey right now very slow being up there for two hours at a time okay which is way more than uh that your your your battery can can last especially for something the size of a car and these these yellow orbs have been seen to just dot around vanish maneuver like on a on a dime is that there cloaking like that energy ball that we just saw in the previous video so we can't see them we can't see exactly what they are they're just glowing balls of light I mentioned earlier that these drones are now in lag Guardia Airport okay in New York look at this here they are they moving out they're branching out now I said when I did the video the other day about that um computer software that predicted a major UAP event happening from the third or fourth of December onwards is this what we're seeing they predicted they predicted a a sky well it predicted a sky battle a UAP versus UAP UAP versus man-made planes battle in the sky now look at this now this has been sent to me so many times a a UA P from New Jersey actually firing I don't know what at but it's firing something check this out it does look like a UAP look at this and look how that moves how it shifts what is it firing at why isn't this all over the news watch it just shift in a second it shoots and then just shifts like like that and then movees slowly [ __ ] it's moving so bizarrely holy cow that thing is completely stationary shooting and not only that there's there's videos now of these things leaving some sort of Trail um spraying something right look at this [ __ ] look at him spraying look at that why is is it spraying that he is spraying the sky now if that is a New Jersey UAP or drone and it's spraying that really puts a spanner in the works because that would suggest or what would it suggest I don't know what is it spraying again bro this is [ __ ] crazy man is it spraying or is that a trail look at this guy they're spraying the skies look at all of them and imagine that this guy imagine just showing this to somebody from five years ago less than that saying look what's going to happen in the skies at some point like what you on about mate UFOs don't exist this guy just sprayed that more drones over Manhattan this is great footage look at this look at the state of this this should be world news updated 247 live 247 from major news outlets but the only people that are covering it is you guys recording on your your camera and US YouTubers and ticktockers right social media platforms so people that covering it properly in depth trying to work out the answers they're all over the place orcas can't bring it down they've said because of the frequency is not there they can't they can't be detected apparently when they're approached they go dark and shoot off probably back to the Atlantic underwater again like the footage I've just shown you this is incredible so that that's that few sentences I just told you then screams alien Tech right but the C to that is over the most densely populated state in America they want to be seen if this is alien Tech they want to be seen clearly now listen to this girl she's a um she's a local in New Jersey I live in New Jersey these drones are on top of my house every single night and here's why I really think they're aliens going to insert a video there was about 10 of them on top of my house last night and they are car sized they are huge they really are the size of small cars but two nights ago one of them crashed 15 minutes from so by the time the Drone one of them crashed she says one of them crashed like yeah which I mentioned and I showed you footage of a crash site or Flames I should say but we didn't know any more about it now she's got a photo of this we go back a little bit hey are car sized they are huge they really are the size of small cars but two nights ago one of them crashed 15 minutes from so by the time the Drone crashed until I got there it was about an hour when I got there it wasn't there there was no drone and I have a picture of it when it have a picture of it when it crashed there was no drone and there was like two cop cars where the [ __ ] did did it go who took it within an hour of it crashing like what and of course nobody has answers the FBI doesn't have an answer our governor doesn't have an answer like nobody knows but apparently we're safe and we have nothing to worry about but nobody knows what they are oh I do think they're aliens I do not think they're from Iran I do not think they're from China because when aliens don't mean any harm and they want peace and they're protecting us they're going to morph themselves into something familiar like a drone even though their car size we're still familiar with drones if aliens wanted harm we'd be walking out to Will Smith and freaking Independence Day okay I I agree with that and this is what I'm saying there's a lot of people saying um can you be serious these things with green and red flashing lights and stuff yeah I'm like if we went over to another planet and we wanted to let that planet know of our presence but discreetly softly we wouldn't go in there with our [ __ ] harria jump Jet right we would look at their Tech and go look we need to just go in there softly just say look we're like you we're okay right and try to mimic their crafts in some way I'm not saying that they are absolutely 100% alien beings right alien Tech I'm just saying that's that's common sense but if the government wanted to create a story of an alien attack right let's put it this way if the government said okay we need to we need Project Blue beam going in full force now we need to create some sort of alien attack when we need to scare the public would they make drones that look like human Tech drones with blinking lights no they wouldn't they would they would create some crazy ass shape that does some weird stuff in the sky to freak us out I really do think they're here because they live here too and I'll tell you where they live they're here to stop World War II for us because they live here too this is their home too and in case you didn't know 80% of our oceans are unexplored and this is where they are coming from the aliens live in the ocean call me crazy that's fine but this is really what I believe and all I'm going to be doing is praying and hoping for the best I live in New Jersey okay now um let's go to this individual here I live in North Jersey and I've seen the drones I'm also an environmental science major and I've taken classes that pertain to this I've taken a GIS geographic information systems course and I've also taken a drones course where we learn how to use government style drones we had an opportunity to actually get a government license from the course we learned how to fly the drones around to collect data using liar and this data was Visual and non-visual data and in GIS we would interpret that data think of software like Google Earth I see a lot of people asking why don't we just fly a drone up and then figure out what these things are that's very illegal any person in possession of a drone that's equipped to fly high enough and have a long enough battery life to check out what these things are they need a government license they also need a permit to fly in any airspace like I I I think that's different in the UK as long as you've got the license and you're not flying over um a PO I suppose a heavy populated area yeah um but that's more like a crowd of people like you can't fly over um a concert or a you know a ball game or something like that you can fly over a city um you just need license if it's over a certain weight like mine and somebody went back and forth with me on this mine my DJI Mini 2 I think it is I don't need a license for that because it's under it's like a couple of grams under the certain weight so I don't need I don't need to go for my course and go for a license I could just me fly it um but if that was happening in my town Nuki I know for a fact my mate mace and me would be out there with drones he's he's he's his drone he needs a license for we'd be out there mate we'd be up there checking these things out um so maybe it's different in the United States and the fact that these drones are in restricted airspace is very fishy to me because why wouldn't the government figure out what they are right in my humble opinion whatever they are the government knows what they are already in my opinion they're not disclosing everything for a specific reason do I know what reason it is I it could be a million things bro didn't major in politics but the government holding a meeting in New Jersey that was all theatrics it's so that the public doesn't freak out I think she speaks a lot of facts there I think there is a lot of that I think we are only told what we need to be told which I think in a in some ways for especially the people in New Jersey is a good is good news because if they do know lot more than we do and they're not shooting them down now I don't think that they're a threat I don't think so anyway thank you so much um although we didn't get any answers a lot more has come to surface it's quite clear now that these things are coming from the ocean they're going back to the ocean they don't want to be seen via radar they can interfere with frequencies but they do want to be seen clearly because they are visiting the most densely populated state in the whole of the US they want to be seen why is that is it to let us know that we're safe they're looking after us is this to do with World War II to say we got you back is it human Tech is it testing out tech for surveillance I if I feel like we're getting closer to the answers but in the same breath we're so far away thank you so much for watching I really hope to see you again take care bye-bye"

UN forecasts that by 2050 68% of the global population will reside in urban areas with this in mind how much worse can we expect traffic jams to become all in all it's high time we Embrace a new mode of transportation according to the creators behind Pegasus their solution is a helicopter equipped with wheels initially you can drive it out of your garage and onto the street just like a regular car but when you see congestion simply switch on the propeller and take to the skies on the ground the Pegasus can reach speeds of 120 kmph and boasts a range of 420 km it can stay airborne for 3 hours and Achieve speeds of up to 160 kmph looking ahead to the 2030s the company aims to manufacture 900 Pegasus units annually what do you think could they actually pull it off [Music] [Applause] in 2023 a whopping 13.6 million electric cars were sold all over the world marking a nearly oneir increase from the previous year this growth seems promising but many urban areas are struggling to adapt to the rapid influx of electric vehicles for instance authorities are grappling with how to install enough charging stations to meet demand as they Ponder this challenge a solution called go sun has emerged this solar power charging device has proven so popular that it raked in over $2 million in just the first 45 days of pre-orders who would say no to an extra 48 km of driving range per day plus the ghost sun is easy to install on your car's roof and can be deployed for use in just a minute [Music] photo kite Sigma drones are literally attached to a specific location with the tether they take off from their cases while dragging a power cable behind them they can climb up to 45 M and stay in the air for up to 24 hours this allows Rescuers firefighters police and other professionals to see much more and respond more effectively to threats the Drone can be launched and landed by anyone even if they have no technical knowledge all they need to do is press a button data from the photoart sigma can be displayed on a laptop tablet or smartphone thanks to Advanced software images from thermal and conventional cameras can be combined and sent up to 20 devices simultaneously the 16 times hybrid Zoom helps you see even the smallest details the T1000 from Terminator 2 was unafraid of damage because it was made of liquid metal when the movie came out in 1991 this seemed incredibly cool however now there are even more impressive Technologies available researchers at CID have created a polymer that behaves similarly if you cut it and then reattach the pieces they'll fuse Back Together by about 97% in Just 2 hours this creates a single strong and flexible material once again you don't need any special conditions the polymer can fuse together at room temperature this material similar to gummy candy is useful for the automotive construction and other Industries and it's only a matter of time before someone creates a T1000 like robot with it [Music] the teleporters from different fantasy books and science fiction movies are a fast way to travel from one location to another although we are still far from having magic Scrolls or devices like Stargate vario has developed a useful alternative instead of transporting people and objects Mario's teleport system moves locations from The Real World to the virtual one here's how it works to use vario teleport you need a smartphone with a special app that scans a room Street or any other space the app then reconstructs the scanned area and turns it into a virtual location that you can explore using a VR headset or a web browser on any Windows or Mac device if you're interested in trying out vario teleport you'll need an iPhone 12 Pro or newer and must sign up for Early Access by filling out the form on the company's [Music] website lifeless robots are once again taking over human jobs this time it's the street cleaners who are on edge the reason the freedom solar power team has developed a solar powered robotic vacuum has already been tested on the streets of Austin Texas collecting over 91 kg of trash in a single day it's called solar umber 4000 this massive machine has a diameter of 2 m requiring 600 W solar panels to operate it moves at a speed of 19 km/ hour and can carry up to 50 kg of waste ke to have this Wonder in your town reach out to the creators but you might want to keep your plans from the local street cleaners [Music] Sky Deck is a unique and pented concept for enhancing airplanes it can be used on any type of aircraft from small business Jets to large Lon haul airliners the idea is to install a transparent capsule with seats in the tail section of the plane allowing passengers to enjoy stunning views in comfort of course these seats will come at a premium price which will be good news for Airlines for added luxury on larger planes an elevator can be installed to access the capsule safety is also a top priority with Sky Deck designed to withstand bird collisions the company is currently in TS with a major Aviation component manufacturer and hopes to produce a batch of capsules that are ready for installation design and science have come together to create the IGS vertical farming technology the creators have already attracted significant Investments of $54 million and developed Advanced automation that doubles or even triples the yield compared to traditional greenh houses plus it requires half as much energy the technology involves building modular towers that can be controlled by smart hardware and AI algorithms making it easy for vertical Farmers to manage lighting ventilation temperature and other parameters The Towers also collect condensation and have a UV sterilization system with a height of up to 12 M there's plenty of space to grow not only greens but also cabbage and [Music] berries the next time you're stuck in traffic take a look around you'll probably notice that most cars have only one or two people in them did you know that just one bus can replace 155 cars however owning a personal car is often seen as a symbol of success it's like saying I make enough money to avoid public transportation but what if taking the bus became just as prestigious and even had the logos of luxury Brands like Audi or BMW designer Marco petravic explored this idea in the moving on challenge with the help of the Yano design team he created a six-seater electric capsule that runs on solar panels and follows a set route like a regular bus but how does this relate to top brands if Audi were to produce such capsules they'd likely gain even more popularity and secure additional contracts for Mass deliveries to cities around the world [Music] we're taking a look at simsoft the company that created a train driver simulator where something that looks like a giant microwave oven crashed into a realistic train cabin the simulator features virtual roots that are similar to games like train Sim World 3 but with added physical levers buttons and other attributes of a model train cabin the simulator can be configured for urban and Inter City railroads street cars and Subway the conditions on the route also change with weather conditions such as snow rain and dense fog as well as smoke and subway tunnels to make the simulation more realistic AI algorithms are used after a training session drivers can review recordings and analyze their [Music] mistakes in the right race for governor of South Dakota chrisy gnome stood out for her ability to handle the strong verbal attacks of her opponents she ended up winning the election and becoming the state's first female governor overall she's a very bright politician maybe that's why she once received a flamethrower as a Christmas gift gnomes showed it off on social media using it to burn a pile of cardboard boxes if you're interested the model is called the pulsefire L te it costs $630 weighs just 2.7 kg and can shoot Flames up to 7.6 M it's definitely a unique way to get voters attention and it's also pretty effective against [Music] Wheats Paris has recently become the first European Capital to ban the rental of electric scooters however people who enjoy mobility and thrills may start looking for new options such as electric skateboards or unicycles like the in motion E20 this model has a motor with a peak power of 900 WS allowing it to reach speeds of up to 20 kmph and travel up to 30 km on a single charge the built-in Bluetooth speakers let you listen to your favorite music while riding additionally the in motion E20 is the the most affordable model in the manufacturer's lineup costing only [Music] $400 the Archimedes wave swing is a wave Power Station designed as a boy it's anchored to the ocean floor and operates in a simple manner as waves push the movable section downward pressure builds up inside the boy once the pressure is strong enough it pushes the section back up and the cycle repeats during this process linear motion is converted into rotation and then into electricity during testing the station produced an average power of 10 KW and a peak power of around 80 KW the manufacturers plan to create units capable of generating 500 KW in the future the Archimedes wave swing Works effectively at depths of 25 M or more and it takes approximately 12 hours to prepare for operation after leaving the [Music] harbor the Brooker h90 is a highly specialized and practical tool for conducting remote hyperspectral analysis specifically it's designed to detect potentially dangerous Gases such as those emitted by non-compliant factories or during terrorist attacks the system can function effectively even from several kilometers away it's capable of pinpointing the origin size and chemical makeup of hazardous plumes Additionally the Brooker h90 comes equipped with a built-in camera that overlays hyperspectral data directly onto video footage this system is great at monitoring gases liquid droplets and particul matter all while operating at 16 scans per second [Music] researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong have created some helpful and amusing robots they took inspiration from snails specifically their ability to move and stop in any position but what is the purpose of this after all these robots are quite slow however don't speed up the video just yet take a look at how well they work together with a combination of a suction cup and two magnets tracks these high tech snails can attach to each other and build various structures for example they can create a bridge for larger robots to Cross or even make a robotic arm these capabilities could be useful for rescue teams let's wish the team the best of L did you know that IBM has already started a new era in Quantum Computing in 2023 they introduced the world's first modular quantum computer and its processor compared to the previous models IBM's Engineers have made significant improvements the new technology produces five times fewer errors and can handle the most complex math chemistry and physics problems while regular computers that take tens of thousands of years to solve these problems quantum computers can do it in minutes additionally IBM says that their new system Quantum system 2 and the Heron processor come with the advanced software kit 1.0 this software speeds up certain tasks by about five times when riding a motorcycle in the rain bikers have to manually wipe their vises which is inconvenient and distracting so why not create a small wiper for them similar to the ones found in cars that's exactly what the makers of biker guard did the cost of this wiper is $345 which may seem high but it's because the brushless motor used in it is very reliable and costs more than the Clon of biker guard available on AliExpress the quality of the wiper has been tested by the ailia racing team who were impressed by it Additionally the wiper design is waterproof and a full charge lasts for 15 hours the manufacturers are confident that this is the first truly functional product of its kind and offer a 3-year warranty [Music] artificial floating islands are often discussed as a way to clean and preserve the beauty of bodies of water the design is usually quite simple pieces of Pete with plants are placed on a polymer Matrix these islands can remove ammonia and phosphates from the water and often become a home for Birds one plant that is commonly used on these islands is Veta which has roots that grow up to 4 M deep in West Africa vertiva is traditionally put into containers of water to prevent bacterial [Music] growth drying grain quickly and correctly can bring several benefits it speeds up the ripening process reduces the activity of harmful microorganisms and extends the storage life of the Harvest that's why research institutes are working on effective drying methods that are affordable for Farmers did you know that there's an international rice Research Institute its Specialists help develop the solar bubble dryer system which was initiated by grain Pro and supported by the University of hoenheim the system has a drying area of 25 or 50 square m and looks like a large bubble supported by fans although simple it's highly efficient and can be found in homemade designs as [Music] well an electric guitar sounds great but you need a place to plug it in while it's convenient to carry the guitar in a case even compact combo amplifiers can be a hassle and that's not even counting the processor or pedal set in short being an electric guitarist can be tough the creators of the mugabi V3 have tried to make things a little easier not only is this guitar foldable but it also has a 40 mm speaker built into the body and that's just the beginning it comes with a built-in preamp and Reverb effect you can even record your successful and not so successful improvisations directly on the guitar with 32 GB of memory providing enough space for 1,300 songs The Mix mode feature can

help you get from one place to a distant place without breaking a sweat pieces of plastic and metal put together the right way can make you communicate with someone who's miles away from you and most importantly information and data can now be stored and retrieved later on and the world is in need of people who understand how this information and Technology works so what exactly is information technology first and foremost it must be understood that this is a very broad topic but information technology is the use of computer systems storages networks and tangible devices technological infrastructure systems and processes to create modify transfer store multiply and exchange all forms of electronic data so what exactly is data data is every type of information from Facts statistics numerical sequences and patterns which is analyzed studied compared modified stored and overall used as a component and the overall information that the technology user needs the value of Information Technology is that although people are capable of handling data using our brains and even the old paper and Pen processes these processes are not as reliable efficient and effective as relying on Information Technology a computer can process millions of pieces of data at a given time its storage or memory can hold and secure information without forgetting a single piece of data so where is information technology applicable from the general information above Information Technology plays a significant role in business some examples of this would be customer handling all the way from handling customer service personal day-to-day communication storing Financial records and all other human activities that deal with handling electronic data information technology is essential to the day-to-day operations of a business and even more important when it comes to scaling your business to make more money and this is why learning the skills of Information Technology is incredibly valuable whether you want to get a job or start your own business next let's talk about Hardware versus software before we can discuss examples of Information Technology it's important that we talk about hardware and software Hardware is tangible technology that you can actually touch when it comes to dealing with information technology from personal computers laptops mobile phones tablets and everything else that is physical and is used for the purposes of It software on the other hand is intangible AKA You can't touch it so this would be things such as websites computer programs or systems and applications and it's going to be broadly separated into two different groups which is software systems and applications software systems are basic programs that are tasked to perform computer functions at its most basic level an example of this would be an operating system for a phone such as iOS or Android applications on the other hand also have a lot of examples such as databases email servers transaction processing systems process control systems Enterprise collaboration systems and many more some examples of this would be slack Dropbox HubSpot Google Drive and Microsoft Office next let's talk about Information Technology as a rear path information technology is very broad but it is a great career path if you are able to learn the skills of Information Technology with the constant rise of technology in this modernized world it is safe to say that you will almost definitely have a job according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations is ninety seven thousand dollars that's over twice the median annual wage for all other applications which is forty five thousand and according to glassdoor.com an entry-level position as an IT Help Desk technician makes over fifty thousand dollars a year so not only does Information Technology offer you a good salary but being nit keeps you updated with the latest in Technology Innovation a few examples of fields related to Information Technology are it management computer systems analyst web development cyber security Cloud Administration and database Administration if you want to learn a way to get into information technology in a few months click the free training which I will put down in the description encryption as well as the pinned comment below this pre-training is offered by a company called course careers which I've mentioned before which routinely gets people jobs in as little as two weeks and oftentimes in a few months for instance check out an interview I did with Della where she was able to get a job at her dream company making over a hundred thousand dollars a year in a month and a half and she was able to do this with zero experience beforehand in the career field

you get to be in this lovely warm cozy Apple ecosystem right as soon as you've got your iPhone then you're going to get yourself a pair of airpods maybe an Apple Watch uh maybe you know airpods Maxes you might then think I need a bigger screen get yourself a iPad with a apple pencil uh or even you know a Macbook this is my MacBook Pro here and if you've got very Deep Pockets maybe even an apple Vision Pro although probably not there's some fantastic hardware and equally fantastic software that ties it all together with airdrop and iMessage and FaceTime and using your iPad as a second screen you can use your watch as a camera preview Apple Health making you feel guilty for not closing your rings and newer stuff like iPhone mirroring to your Mac and apple intelligence and also fundamentally the benefits that come with apple owning everything the hardware the software the App Store that vertical integration that makes everything just simple and seamless and safe we're not dealing with Android and Windows here the Apple ecosystem is fantastic but can you get the same experience or maybe even a better experience with Team Samsung I mean straight away you've got a huge range of phones from the more regular S4s you've got the s24 Ultras you've got the folds and the flips arguably the best foldy flippy phones you can buy right now you've got your Galaxy buds Pro 3 you've got your Galaxy Rings your Galaxy Tabs with SP pens and of course your Galaxy books this is the new Galaxy book 4 edge with a Snapdragon X Series ship all this stuff and so much more from TVs to home appliances and crucially they match pretty much every single one of Apple's features with Quick Share and foam mirroring multicontrol second screens Samsung Health Smart things and of course we've got Galaxy AI now to be fair most of the tech Brands the big ones these days have their own kind of ecosystem uh Huawei in particular you've got xiaomi and honor and OnePlus but I would argue these guys are the big ones the best in terms of having a fully-fledged ecosystem but which one is better well I'm going to break this video down into eight different categories award a point to one of the two and then hopefully by the end we'll see and of course being an apple versus Samsung video I'm sure I'm going to get a few comments saying how incredibly wrong I am and that's absolutely fine do let me know which one you think is the best ecosystem in the comments below and also if there is actually anything that would make you jump ship between them and finally a big thank you to Apple for sponsoring this video can you imagine if I did that that'd be ridiculous no sponsorships here completely my opinion let's get into it number one let's talk about phones this is an iPhone 15 Pro Max uh although we are due with the 16 series late September so getting to the end of its life here and then also we have the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra right now these are the flagship Rivals we're probably going to get s25 in January or show the release Windows a little bit different between these two both exceptional phones You could argue the case which is better all day long but that is it from Apple whereas team Samsung we also have the Galaxy F old six and also the flip 6 we don't have anything like this on team Apple simply put Samsung just has a much greater range of options with the Zed the S the m and the a series which actually if you rearrange those letters it doesn't actually spell anything that would have been fun but given the cheapest iPhone is the SE from 2 years ago at about 430 quid I would definitely take a Galaxy a55 over that especially as he gets 120 HZ screen something that even the iPhone 15 which costs twice as much still doesn't get now this won't be controversial at all but between the s24 ultra and the 15 Pro Max I tend to carry the iPhone with me every day the main reason for that is video stabilization being able to shoot in prores log and also the Cinematic mode and also with the new file cut camera the iPhone for me is just as much a work device as it is like my personal phone having said that I do still bring the s24 ultra with me most time as well I've got two pockets why not have two phones um but one of the most underrated features of the Samsung is this anti reflective screen if I find my uh Studio light I absolutely love that it's so much less reflective it's similarly bright much easier to use Outdoors the Samsung has an extra camera lens it's still the long range Zoom king and you just have a whole bunch more camera options with 8K video directors view you've got expert raw even just the basic stuff like being able to pause the recording and switch the cameras from the front to back and vice versa while recording I miss all this on the iPhone and you've got Samsung deck you can have you know two apps side by side which bizarrely you still car even on the iPhone Pro max they're both fantastic phones and really it's going to come down to do you want iOS or Android between the flagships I'm going to call a tie but just because of the sheer range of options you've got with Samsung from the you know budget end all the way to folds and flips I'm going to give it to The Blue Team Samsung get a point number two headphones earphones these are the Galaxy buds 3 Pro this is the airpods pro second gen about the same price as like a tener between them 230 quid 220 near enough the same these are the pro level phones they were also non-pro versions so a little bit more affordable very very similar and I'm not an audio file I will hold my hands up to that so I'm not going to tell you which one sounds better they're both very very good active noise cancellation uh similar battery lives the only problem with these new buds 3 Pro is that Samsung recalled them at launch apparently these ear tip things were tearing too easily so theyve actually paused the launch of these it will probably be fixed by the time you watch this um so it's not going to trouble anyone who's actually bought one but it was initially a bit of launch issue there however Apple do have an over a option these are the airpods max but they're also a couple of years old now and they're still £500 and I probably wouldn't recommend them I mean they've got a lining port with du a refresh version soon there is so much great overr competition now so little bit hard to recommend these but still an option that we just don't have with Team Samsung at least not yet so realistically whichever phone you pick will likely be the deciding factor over which earphones you buy but these are very evenly matched but I suppose with some of the quality control issues with this and the fact that we have an ere option even if it is a bit old there's not much in it but I'm going to give the point there to Apple number three let's talk about wearables and it's quite funny because throughout we see these Brands kind of copying each other a little bit often apple is slower with features and then they roll something out and say oh look now you've got iPhone mirroring or now you've got customizable home screens it's the best thing ever but we've had on Android for a million years but then on the flip side sometimes Samsung takes design cues uh from Apple or you know new formats of hardware and they kind of do their own thing but this just takes the biscuit Apple makes a watch Ultra Samsung makes literally a watch Ultra even matching the 3,000 L of brightness we get the same red night mode and this is hilarious Apple has The Ocean band for the watch Samsung has their Marine band it's like that Meme of can I copy your homework but just change it up a bit but then in the end who cares imitation just the highest form of flattery and it means we get great rugged options with mulp Day Battery lives from both Brands and that's alongside cheaper regular watches with different sizes different band options all with fantastic Fitness tracking there's not much between them there and so despite some clear homework copying going on wearables go beyond just a watch because Samsung has just launched this guy this is the Galaxy ring in this very smart little charging case I like this a lot and this is going to go up against your aura rings and your Ultra humans you can see here next to my wedding ring it's a little bit chunkier but this is a 400 smart ring it's titanium I've got the black one here it's got a ton of sensors built in the main use case for me is sleep tracking because I find it bit uncomfortable wearing a smartwatch to bed I also like to charge it overnight so that's useful and also if you do pair it with a Galaxy watch it'll actually use the best sensors between them and give you more accurate readings and also extend the battery life of both devices it is an independent accessory uh but it is improved if you use a Galaxy watch and also you can use this with other Android phones but you will get the most features if you pair it with a Galaxy phone but it's a Nifty bit of Kit I'm excited to use this a bit more and it's something that Apple just doesn't offer however what we do have from Team apple is a headset the um Apple Vision Pro which has now launched in a lot more countries it's not just us only I've got that a bit mixed up there but it is still3 and a halfish th000 just that now I've had this on my desk for well since it launched I actually imported one myself I bought this from the US when it launched and the first two weeks absolutely magical you can watch my full review on it really really cool bit of tech I don't think there is a device in the last few years that have given me so many holy moments like proper wow Tech but since then after say the first two or 3 weeks I don't think I've used it once I know I took it to a friend's house because I'm one of those people to show it off cuz they really wanted to try it but beyond that it's just s my desk and it's a very impressive technically bit of Kit and and the vision os2 software is coming with some improved gestures we get better Mac support with ultra wide display modes which I'm very excited about the travel Mode's been improved as well particularly for trains so they have addressed a bunch of the criticisms I had in my review but I still just don't want to wear it there's no point in my day whether I'm relaxing in the evening or I'm working during the day where I think you know what I want to go into my own little VR AR whatever you want to call it spatial world look at some videos by myself although you can share play now actually but then you know 10 15 30 minutes later come out and go without fail I will get a bit sweaty it'll ruin your hair it's a cool idea but it's too expensive and it just doesn't have that one killer use case that I can't do you know to some extent on other things so very much like the Galaxy ring it's a nice to have it's a cool bit of tech but probably not something I'd recommend so in terms of the wearables I think it's a Ty of SmartWatches Samsung's got the Galaxy Ring Apple's got the Vision Pro I'm going to be really annoying and call this a tie number four tablets this is the latest 2024 iPad Pro 11 in and this if I don't drop it this is the latest still Samsung Galaxy type S9 Ultra both absolutely stunning Flagship tablets you get keyboards and styluses with both in fact you get it bundled with the Galaxy Tab separate uh pencil pencil Pro with the iPad both Brands offer great budget mid-range and high-end options however Samsung does offer a super duper cheap a series so again as slightly bigger range of options from Samsung so what do I like about the Galaxy Tabs well firstly the aspect ratio is obviously much wider than an iPad so for watching videos and movies you'll get less letter boxing also if you want to use it vertically that's more mimicking the aspect ratio of a phone for social apps for scrolling through websites also this tab S9 Ultra is 14.6 in the biggest iPad's 13 in it's nuts if anything is actually a bit too big and importantly all tab S9 even the cheapest one for 350 quid have an Spen bundle in the box and have at least a 990 HZ refresh rate you literally have to buy a 1,000 iPad Pro to get a higher than 60 HZ refresh you've also got the book cover keyboard to turn it more into a laptop and of course we've got Samsung's Dex mode which gives you a full desktop and since it runs Android you do have a lot more flexibility for installing third party apps and stores versus the closed App Store you get on the iPad the only downsides are that this is actually a little bit old now it came out mid 2023 so we actually haven't had a 2024 refresh yet the rumors are that we'll see one probably in October is and also while for some people they will want an Android tablet I suspect most people probably won't genuinely because apps just aren't as well optimized for these bigger screens for Android tablets uh with a Google Play Store versus iPad apps on the Apple App Store so in favor of the iPad we have iPad OS we have the Apple App Store which is just generally a smoother better optimized experience for a tablet with apple arcade with specific Apple exclusive apps like procreate and Final Cut also while the apple pencil is bought separately I would argue that the pencil Pro with the magic keyboard while expensive are the best you can get for a tablet I also really appreciate Apple has discontinued the older 9th gen iPad with the chunky bowel and the home button but instead they've dropped the price and made the 10th gen the new default cheap option and for most people that is all you need although I do really like the new 13-in Air because you get a big screen iPad for 500 quid less than the same siiz Pro and so between these two specifically the iPad gets brighter we've got a more powerful chip again it's going to come down to do you want iOS or Android for me though I'm going to give the point to Apple when it comes to tablets but what about these laptops PCS well I can tell you that for the longest time I used a Samsung Galaxy S whatever and a d XPS laptop for like five or six years I just use those constantly because a great combination but then Apple came out with the M1 chip which actually made me switch to the MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 ditching my XPS and then because I used this I thought well it' be nice to have an iPhone as well so I could use airdrop got myself an iPhone I thought well it' be good to have an air you know airpods and then a watch so it was actually the laptop that first got me into the Apple ecosystem and obviously this is just my opinion but even with their flaws I still think MacBook A's MacBook Pros are the best allaround the laptops unless you want to play some proper games but things are getting a little bit more interesting on the Windows side this is the Samsung Galaxy book for Edge and I mentioned earlier that this is actually one of the first wave of laptops to come with a different kind of chip this is the Snapdragon X Elite so it's an Arm based chip rather than traditional x86 that you get from Intel and AMD and so for the first time we're seeing MacBook level MacBook quality of laptop on a Windows device in terms of the performance also the performance on battery it doesn't suffer much at all being away from the charger the battery life how cool and quiet it runs these are fantastic laptops now there is a bit of a caveat because with this new architecture like we saw with the Apple transition although that was pretty seamless there are some app compatibility issues not all apps will run the vast majority will but not all of them they're not all as well optimized but this is just one of I think six different models of galaxy book 4 with regular book fours the pro the 360 the pro 360 The Edge and the ultra and only this Edge has the Snapdragon chip all others have a traditional Intel Core Ultra chip with the ultra offering a dedicated RTX 470 graphics card there's Chromebooks there's a 360 Flip option there are touch screens and there are also a lot of advantages to Windows especially for Enterprise and Gamers so some really bloody good laptops from Samsung but on the other hand apple offers the iMac allinone and also the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro desktop although all three are due an M4 upgrade hopefully later this year and there's also a reason the mbook airs the mbook pros like I have here are so popular because there isn't a better combination of design power performance battery life web webcam quality the Fantastic keyboard and touchpad and you know just the simple ease of use of Mac OS the downsides are that you have fewer options to choose from also it's not as well optimized for games by any stretch that's definitely Windows territory also the cheapest MacBook realistically is like a ,000 Macbook here so really it's going to come down to whether you prefer Windows or Mac OS so I'm going to call it frustratingly a tie even though I tend to use this myself so I've got a lot of devices on the table here but what about the more extended family because we're talking about the EOS system and it does go beyond what I've got on the desk here I mean Apple has the desktop Macs they've got Apple TV homepod The Vision Pro of course plus you've got air tags and some extra services but Samsung well Samsung just make everything TVs projectors washing machines fridges vacuum cleaners air conditioners monitors they've got their own smart tags as well they make everything and the kitchen SN most of which is tied together through their smart things app kind of like Apple's hom kit except for a billion different products does the fact that you can buy a Samsung TV fundamentally change your experience using one of their phones or their headphones or their laptops no not really but this video is all about the ecosystem and unquestionably Samsung has the biggest extended family it's all broadly connected I think that deserves a point however while we've got all this lovely Hardware equally important the thing that actually you know connects it all together and mix an ecosystem and not just a lot of products that have the same logo is the software the features now this could be like an hourong video by itself so I'm going to keep it brief let's see if Samsung can keep up with what we get on Apple One airdrop well on this we have Quick Share which actually recently merged with Google's nearby share um and is basically the same thing and actually it works with a whole lot more devices outside of just the Galaxy ecosystem other Android phones other Windows laptops uh iMessage well there isn't a direct equivalent Macs do now support RCS messaging with the latest software we still have blue and green bubbles and all that nonsense but Samsung doesn't really have an iMessage equivalent nor does it have a FaceTime equivalent like a first party video calling app you can actually send a link from an iPhone or you know an Apple device to an Android user and they can join your FaceTime but it doesn't go both ways you can't use share play which you can if you keep it within the Apple ecosystem and of course you could just use zoom or meets or teams or whatever you want to use but there isn't like a direct equivalent to FaceTime but then we have Apple's universal control which includes sidecar using your iPad as a second screen and also peripherals like your mouse and keyboard across multiple devices and even be able to copy text from one device and paste it on another I use this all the time you've got continuity camera to use your iPhone as your max webcam and with the latest IOS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia we now have iPhone mirroring can your Samsung do all that well the short answer is yeah actually mostly it can broadly their equivalent to universal control is Samsung flow with a few specific apps including multicontrol which lets you control multiple Galaxy devices I can rearrange them based on my setup and then use the laptop's trackpad and keyboard across all three I can also transfer files this way anything I copy gets added to the clipboard and I can paste it to any of the devices Samsung's second screen feature also lets you use your tablet as an external display for your Galaxy book both Apple and Samsung let you use your phone's camera as a webcam and they both have phone mirroring feature-wise it is very similar and you've also got you know homeit smart things uh Apple Health Samsung Health you've got notes Samsung Notes photos Samsung gallery and even the file Cod camera app versus is expert rule on Samsung there's like a one for one for pretty much everything however Samsung does offer decks and although I can't say I use it that much I know some people swear by it so feature wise very very similar between them what I would say from my own experience though is that it's all a bit easier a bit more seamless a bit more responsive particularly using SC car with your iPad or the continuity camera or iPhone mirroring it's all a bit faster and nicer to use with the Apple products that's been my experience and while it's not something I'm particularly bothered about I know a lot of people do want IM message and FaceTime and so for those Reasons I'm going to give the point to Apple I can't believe we're this far through the video basically at the end I've not even mentioned the word AI yet or maybe I have anyway it's a tricky one because right now Apple intelligence isn't really here yet uh you can get it in the beta software it's coming to the US with I think iOS 18.1 it's been a little bit delayed later in the year but us only us English for now so it's going to be a bit of a slower roll out and quite frankly Apple has fallen behind series useless currently will be a lot better with apple intelligence but they playing catop and actually I reckon Samsung is way out ahead here but they also have one big advantage that it's not just tied to one ecosystem we've got Google's Gemini on Android we've got copilot on Windows but we do also have a whole bunch of Samsung's own in-house Galaxy AI features with all these translation and transcription assistance you've got interpreter modes so even taking advantage of the second screen on the flip and the fold you've got image generation tools like sketch the image which is kind of like co-creator on Windows and we're getting something similar on Apple intelligence 3D moving photos like your mom does on Facebook you've got Circle to search you've got AI generated wallpapers and probably more importantly some very impressive photo editing tools in the gallery app you can do a lot of this in say the Google photos app on your iPhone as well but right now in terms of AI I'm going to give the point to Samsung eight categories down let's tally the points and we're looking at three for Apple three for Samsung and two ties think okay it's a draw of course it is it very much depends on what you are used to what you prefer and also what you can afford because while Samsung offers some fantastic high-end Hardware across the board they also give you more affordable options it's a much higher more expensive barrier to entry for this stuff the good news though is that both have exceptional ecosystems I would say apples tends to be a little bit more seamless but then Samsung gives you a greater range of products Apple Hardware tends to hold its value for longer but then you can often find better deals on Samsung Hardware as they go on sale but as the saying goes if you sit on the fence and you'll get splinters in your ass but I am fortunate enough to have access to all of this Tech I can pick and choose what I want to use and right now I am leaning more towards the Apple side of things predominantly for the MacBook but I also love the iPhone we've got a new one coming in late September but that's me what about you which would you go for wish do you think the ecosystem let me know in the comments below and also let me know if there is anything that would make you jump ship between C these a like And subscribe will be fantastic and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat"

this certification they can confidently apply for State tenders and trade into nationally it's no surprise that their balconies while seeming ordinary feature several impressive Technologies for instance Lee uses an aluminium alloy that's 20% stronger than others paired with alue Comfort powder coating these balconies can withstand hail think the glass won't hold up to the elements it's special too having endured the impact of a 50 kg Pendulum In tests one secret to their durability is multi-layering a film is placed between two pieces of glass plus the advanced Alo Comfort plus painting technology makes the balcony look like wood such as [Music] Oak xcl is a handy system that lets you insulate a building and add brick cladding at the same time first workers in install extruded poyene boards which range in thickness from 17 to 100 mm next they attach narrow brick cladding using adesive and add mortar for strength and to mimic real brick [Music] work the final result is just 33 mm thick and weighs from 36 kg per square meter it's a great option for upgrading wooden buildings too plus it's eco-friendly as making this cladding requires 60 to 70% less energy than traditional [Music] bricks AFS logic wall is a permanent formwork that combines several interesting features first the panels can be customized reducing prep work on the construction site second the production process is finally tuned just 8 days pass from the moment the drawings are approved to the delivery of the finished formwork third the panels can be installed manually saving sites where cranes can't be used it's also worth noting the wide range of sizes the width reaches 1.1 M and the height is 4.2 m need more the manufacturer is open to discussing larger options plus AFS logic wall is a great durable base for finishing [Music] materials Geo plus modulo formwork turned out to be so so great that it was used during the Reconstruction of the VIP Zone at the famous Roland garos Stadium even smaller projects have been successful with it here's a video from Romania where workers are building a ventilated [Music] Foundation using 4800 formwork blocks they covered an area of 12200 square m in just 8 Days overall geoplast modulo is a great choice for spaces that use r on and need ventilation and if speed is important the manufacturer suggest adding fast leg blocks that allow pouring in one step from a height of over 50 [Music] cm Arrow lift lifts houses yes just like that each Tower of this amazing system can support up to 20 tons now Builders can repair foundations install footings or dig excavations without any obstacles the maximum lifting height is 5.2 M leaving plenty of room for Machinery like excavators if the house is too heavy for Four Towers just add more to increase the load capacity [Music] more height that can be discussed too and if workers haven't used something like this before the manufacturer offers training this is the future both machines and houses are reaching New [Music] Heights we're in Takahashi a small Japanese City with less than 30,000 people that's been affected by landslides in the past to protect itself against them the city decided to build reinforcing structures one of the most interesting Parts is when a worker secured by a cable like a rock climber sprays concrete but it's not enough to just create something that looks like a giant Tic Tac toeboard the structure needs to be secured with humans sized anchors for this the Japanese used an ESD 210 machine which can adjust its angle from - 10 to 90° the effort paid off the slope is now much stronger take that [Music] Landslide Eed raised floorings are strong enough for 20 mm thick porcelain Stone wear and they let you hide cables pipes and other stuff putting them in is quick and simple as you can lay the tiles in different patterns and if the customer wants wood they'll be happy to know that even a 244 cm long board won't move and the surface stays [Music] stable also Eck floors don't need special care in Winter and work well by the pool [Music] [Music] this pit doesn't stand a chance a worker arrives with two bags the first contains 14 to 20 mm of bitamin coated chippings known as agrill it fills potholes up to 6 cm deep and is commonly used alongside with chipfill worms made of thermoplastic [Music] when heated with a burner they form a strong top layer that cars can drive on in just 20 minutes the road is ready for use again chip fill can also be used on its own for smaller pits besides a burner the worker needs a brush and gloves [Music] Rhino products are excellent for structural strengthening and crack repair in concrete as a leading company they've created a system that's easy to install but highly effective in creating super strong joints the main part is a rebar like lock made of carbon fiber which doesn't corrode and is 10 times stronger than steel one lock has a tensile strength of 1,315 kg Rhino uses epoxy resin to fill the joints making it easy to paint over them later this repair method works well for Mason rate swimming pools industrial buildings and more especially when the deflection is less than 5 cm [Music] when it comes to spray Coatings Titan applicators is the company to trust like Rhino it's a leader in its field among other things it has developed a replacement for EPDM roofing membranes using foam this is a great option because at a thickness of Just 2 and 1/2 CM the heat transfer resistance reaches seven for comparison an insulated brick wall has a rating of about 2.5 plus the foam doesn't shrink it prevents mold and fungus growth and keeps insects out it also reduces drafts and noise making it suitable for both residential and Commercial properties [Music] ponds tunnels landfills Bento fix mats are used in many different projects and offer top-notch insulation against water gases and Vapors this is all thanks to their multi-layer structure each map combines several layers of geotextile with bentonite powder dried and finally ground clay in between this sandwich is needle punch to hold together the improved Shear strength comes from thermal lock technology in the video Builders use benter fix in a British project to turn a landfill into a park they're also reinforcing a German dam making use of the fact that the mats are easy to work with even underwater [Music] the paon system is made to store storm water while it may not be as impressive as the famous ancient Greek Temple its dimensions are astonishing in normal conditions A pathon system can hold up to 8 million lers even at this scale Builders can complete the installation in a day in the morning the components arrive and by evening the finished system is already covered with Earth its durability is also notable if pathon is placed under a road even four axle trucks can safely drive over it plus customers can add extras like filters and flushing pip work to the system and workers will surely enjoy having built the pathon on their resumés [Music] Cobra is essential for complex drywall ceiling projects these patented flexible profiles are considered Innovative and even revolutionary by their creators they're so easy to use that a single person can handle them just manually shape the profile to the desired curve and Cobra will remember it eliminating the need for extra fixing tools or inserts now making arches domes and similar elements will be easier than ever each profile is 3 m long there are five width options from 3 to 10 cm Cobra's safety margin is ensured by its 0.6 mm thick galvanized steel Construction [Music] next it's time for pip playing Specialists to start working their job involves many steps each needing careful assembly neatness and precise calculations they control the position of the details prepare and compacts the base and install waterproofing it's a lot of work especially with heavy steel or concrete parts that weigh as much as a car but pipelines are crucial for infrastructure and need extra attention for instance the Aging water system system in the US has 240,000 leaks yearly if CTS aren't maintained properly railroads and highways can be [Music] affected low San acoustic panels help lower the noise in a room by 50% while the video shows the tools you need to install these panels let's see some of their features a standard panel measures 240x 60x 2 cm and is made of a non-woven fabric composed of polyester MDF and veneer such as oak or Birch to maintain the quality sellers suggest regularly treating the purchase with oil it's worth noting that these panels can be easily cut on the construction s making switches and sockets less of a hassle for installation it's recommended to use Flathead screws with 15 needed per [Music] [Music] panel when a construction project is over there's always a significant amount of waste left adding to the planet's waste problem in Russia alone we're talking about hundreds of millions of tons of construction waste annually some experts believe that modern construction processes are among the most polluting human activities to address this teams worldwide are exploring ways to make a change let's look at a project developed by students from the Zurich University of applied sciences their idea is to print formwork on a 3D printer using Earth in instead of traditional concrete they use cement-free [Music] compounds Pebble lock is a great way to refresh a worn out driveway parking lot or parking area the 24 mm High mats secure Pebbles crushed stone Granite chips and other loose material aterial this eliminates the need for asphalt paving or concrete and if you prefer you can even avoid hiring workers as installing Pebble lock is easy enough to do it yourself the resulting surface allows water to drain through preventing puddles for Pebbles the recommended size is 8 to 14 mm it looks neat attractive and is eco-friendly as the mats are made from recycled plastic [Music] the list of benefits of prefabricated monolithic slabs from the company Domo vadets is quite long they weigh half as much as a solid slab and cost almost a third less they don't need a scre and are great for sites where heavy machinery can't reach Plus they allow you to hide utility lines in their voids there are just four parts to the slab system a loadbearing reinforced concrete or metal beam a block insert made of air rated concrete expanded clay blocks or EPS concrete which actess formwork a reinforcing mesh and structural concrete besides these advantages this combination offers better thermal insulation which is useful if the building has lots of bay wind window and other architectural features and the installation is fast no more than 1 human hour per square meter from the Exxon Mobile Refinery to the US capital lift Bots have an impressive track record it's no surprise as one of these lifting robots can be installed in under half an hour and lift loads at a speed of 42 m per minute allowing construction workers to EAS easy lift up to 6 tons in an 8 hour shift the standard lifting height is 50 m with the option to increase it if needed lift bot runs on electricity it works 10 hours on a full battery and recharges from a standard 110 or 220 volt Outlet this makes construction s safer and saves up to 44% on labor costs moreover this lifting robot can be installed on [Music] scaffolding bullfrog track 2 is a simple but useful tool for construction workers to level concrete a cable is stretched between the edges of the port area and the bullfrog track 2 moves back and forth creating smooth strips 1.2 to 3 m wide it's battery powered and a full charge covers 1,115 s m when the battery is almost empty an indicator light flashes and an alarm sounds the kit includes 2 30 m cables so no need to search for a rope to operate the bullfrog track two you'll need a team of Two And it costs about $3500 [Music]"

So I thought before Diwali, if you haven't bought anything yet, I'll give you some good deals. I've brought 4 good smartphone deals but this is a little different. Because I didn't just want to talk about smartphones, I wanted to talk about their hearts & brains too. We always say in our videos that the processor is very important & there's a reason. It's not just because of the AnTuTu score, when we unbox it, we tell you about the AnTuTu score. So that you come to know about the performance & there's a benchmark. This processor is actually a system on chip. It's a complete system. Meaning how your camera will function, how your connectivity is going to be, how your DSP, ISP, image signal processing, digital signal processing is going to be. All these things are dependent on SoC. And obviously, Snapdragon processors are always ahead. And generally, when I talk to consumers, one thing that comes to mind is that people prefer Snapdragon processors. And there's a reason, the Snapdragon processors are generally good when it comes to CPU, GPU & other things. Even connectivity, modem, even power efficiency. And all the phones I'm going to tell you about are on Snapdragon processors. But this 1st deal, OMG! I mean, seriously, I've said this before & I'm still saying it. And in deals, it's such a value for money phone. I'm talking about POCO F6. Yes, 8S Gen 3 comes on this processor. It's the latest generation processor with AnTuTu score of 1.5M. No matter how much you say, AnTuTu score gives you a benchmark & tells you how powerful it is. And this is one of the most powerful smartphones out there. Meaning you'll be able to play games on the highest settings. And why am I saying it's so good? It's not only a processor, but it's the latest RAM type. It has LPDDR5X RAM type & UFS 4.0 storage type. It has AI features like AI Eraser Pro, AI Image Expansion, AI Gesture Controls. There are many such features. And remember, FPS is very important in gaming. The higher the FPS, the better. And this phone supports Super Resolution. It also upscales the graphics & frame quality while gaming. So it's ideal for gaming. And the camera is 50MP plus 8MP. You get a functional 8MP Ultra Wide & 20MP selfie camera. And because of the Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 processor, the ISP is very powerful. Which gives you really good pictures. So that's about the phone, let's talk about the deal. If I talk about the deal prices of POCO F6, I'm showing it on the screen. I don't know if you can see it on the screen, but I'm giving an updated price. And it's available on Flipkart. By the way, Flipkart & Amazon are not the same, I'm going to tell you the deals on both the platforms. POCO F6 with 8S Gen 3 is a steal! Let's talk about the next Motorola phone, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion. If you want a slim & light lifestyle phone, then you can definitely look at it. It also has 7S Gen 2 with 6.10L & 6.20L AnTuTu scores. You get 68W charging & a 5nm battery, even though it's this thin & light. Battery life & battery backup is also good. And if I talk about the cameras, then Edge 50 Fusion's cameras are very improved. Especially if you look at this generation of Motorola phones, they're really improved. It has a primary sensor, a 700C Sony light sensor, 13MP Ultra Wide & 32MP selfie. And yes, remember, the 4-6nm fabrication process, I'm showing you on the screen. How power efficient the phones are. The less, the more power efficient. And if I talk about the camera output, Edge 50 Fusion's colours are natural & the details are good. I'm showing you samples on the screen, but let's talk about the deal. You'll get the Moto Edge 50 Fusion in this deal for just Rs 19,999, which is under Rs 20K. And the links to the deals are given in the description. And let me tell you about another gaming phone which has a good deal. And again, iQOO is launching value for money phones. And this one is iQOO Z9s Pro. And you know, it comes on the 7th Gen 3, which has a good AnTuTu score of 8.5L. So you can easily do 60FPS gaming. You can play BGMI on 60FPS. And if I talk about this segment, then the 7th Gen 3 is a new processor, power efficient & one of the most capable processors in this price range. And for gamers, you get an Ultra Game Mode, Motion Controller & a Vegan Leather design which looks nice. Thermals are also in check. And if I talk about the camera, it's a 50MP camera with 16MP selfie camera. I'm showing you some samples of that as well, so go & check it out. But let's talk about the deal. I forgot to tell you that the battery is of 5500mAh. This is really thin & slim but still it's a 5500mAh battery. And it has 80W charging. And if I talk about the deal price of the iQOO Z9s Pro, you'll get it for Rs 21,749. But you'll get it on Amazon. And finally, let's talk about Realme's number series. Realme 13 Pro is known for its camera. It has a Snapdragon processor with good ISP. So this is definitely camera centric. And Realme's number series phones generally have good cameras. If I talk about the camera, it has a 50MP light sensor, 8MP ultrawide & 32MP selfie camera. And I'm showing you samples on the screen, you're going to like it. The colours, details & dynamic range of this camera is really good. It's one of the better cameras out there in this particular price range. Even in low light, the photos come out quite good. If I talk about the processor, it's the same as the Motorola H50 Fusion. It's the same 7S Gen 2 with an AnTuTu score of 6.10L & 6.20L. It has good connectivity too. It has Wi-Fi 6 & it supports all 5G bands in India. And the processor also makes a difference in connectivity. So if you have a Snapdragon, you get good connectivity because of its modem. And this one has Wi-Fi 6, so no problems there. If I talk about the battery, it's a 5200mAh battery with 45W charging. Let's talk about the deal, that's important, so wait for that. You're going to get the Realme 13 Pro in this deal at Rs 21,999. And it's also available on Flipkart. And as I said, all the deals mentioned have their links in the description. Which deal did you like the most out of these deals? Do let us know in the COMMENTS! Also, we've made this video in collaboration with Qualcomm. But these deals are there & we've told you that we've liked them. This might be the last deal video of 2024, so don't forget to share it with your friends! That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"
niiOpwSonx0,Oxygen OS 15 - No. It&#39;s Not an iOS Clone!,"OxygenOS 15 is finally here and in this video, we've done a deep dive of the new features that has come with OxygenOS 15.",Trakin Tech English,2024-10-24T16:00:54Z,28,"['Trakintech', 'trakin Tech English', 'oxygenos 15', 'oxygenos 15 features', 'oneplus oxygenos 15', 'oxygen os 15', 'oxygenos 15 review', 'oxygenos 15 changes', 'oxygenos 15 beta', 'oxygenos 15 update', 'oxygen os', 'oxygenos 15 release date', 'oxygenos 15 improvements', 'oxygenos 15 ai', 'oxygen os 15 tips', 'oxygenos 15 preview', 'oxygen os 15 update',

hindi']",PT10M27S,499952,1188,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology'],True,so Spotify is running on iOS 18 and oxygen OS 15 right now and look at this they literally lifted Apple's live activities on Dynamic Island and they use this as live alerts right now it looks very similar right essentially what happens is that in iOS 18 and oxygen 15 you can move certain apps to a little window at the top as a live activity or a live alert and you can expand the activity there itself see I'll show you so on iOS you have to tap and hold and on this you just have to tap it but oxygen os5 made it its own and it does two things better lets you choose if you want to tap to expand the card or you want to open the app so you have that choice in your hands but more importantly if you put two supported apps to Live alerts and if you tap it then you have an expanded stack with two expanded cards and you know what oxygenos 15 is full of these inspired but improved moments so for the sake of this video I'm going to categorize all the new features in oxygen os5 into three categories original inspired and improved or copied and yes there is a different between inspired and copied so basically when I do this at the end of the video you can figure out how you feel about oxyen o5 kapish all right I'm Asad you're watching track and te English your destination for detailed incisive catet [Music] reviews the moment I started using oxyen 15 the first thing that struck me were the improved animations it's smoother it's faster it's more consistent than any other operating system I've used till date yes that also includes Apple's IOS this is the first big upgrade that you see and it's called parallel animations so when you open an app and close it and then open another app immediately after you close it or in between that action itself the animations flow smoothly there is literally no starter so when you actually open and close 20 apps side by side on oxygenos 15 and oxygenos 14 and you see them side by side and you will realize how good it looks and the fun fact is that oxygenos 14 was smooth to begin with and the animation improvements also extend to other parts of the system for example when you're opening a folder and one thing that we notice is that when you have a widget on the screen for example the clock widget and you open it even that animation is really smooth in fact if you look at it on iOS 18 it's kind of stuttery there's also a new charging animation there's a new Holo fingerprint animation and the volume slider has this thin volume slider too so when it comes to the new animations oxygen os5 is original and good and if you folks think that tracking English content is also original and good then we'd love your support go hit that subscribe button if you haven't already now I keep saying this over and over again primarily because like like a lot of you watch our videos but only very few of you subscribe so it'll help us out oh by the way one more thing I must mention is that oxygenos 15 on future OnePlus phones for example OnePlus 13 will actually have a 20% lighter install on the system which means that you will have more storage space for you to use now we also asked why that cannot be implemented on you know OnePlus 12 that's because the new hardware the new system the new software all of that have to work together so that is why oxygen o5 will be a lighter install on OnePlus 30 also oxygen o 15 has made great improvements to the always on display and the lock screen the new flux themes seamlessly blend your wallpaper clock style and additional info with the all on display lock screen and the home screen there are a few different styles to choose from and you can use any wallpaper to create a gorgeous depth effect on the lock screen but all of the text that you see is all preed you can't create your own text or write your own text which I feel is like what I mean shouldn't given us the option right because most of the text that OnePlus has given you option for apart from never settle of course are all pretty lame motivational codes I would never use them now for aod and lock screen changes I'll rate it inspired and improved another change is that quick settings can now be used in Split mode so when you swipe down from the top right you can see the quick settings and the notifications are at the top left of course very similar to how iOS and a lot of Android skins do these days and the Quick Settings design has been slightly updated to it's very well-rounded and looks pretty good again i' rate it inspired and slightly improved as for the rest of the visual changes I noticed a couple of extra icon options I saw Radiance and Shadow and the aquamor has moved to classic style now I like the new icons they do look good plus there are a few new cards in the OnePlus shelf which I don't think I've ever used do you guys actually use it let me know in the comment section below but the widget Pages design is the exact same plus the app drawer is exactly the same as well no changes there there's a neat little Easter egg in oxygen o5 now and I think a few of you will remember it how nice is that but of course not just this the feature upgrades are also very very interesting for example there's a new share with iPhone option apart from Quick Share that works with Android devices it's a little bit of a convoluted process but it works the first time you share a file with iOS oxy 15 will share a QR code which will make your iPhone download the op plus Connect app once downloaded there's a Wi-Fi connection created between the two phones and then you can transfer your files easily I mean of course it's a workaround and it's making you download an app on iPhone but at least they figured out a solution now I won't have to use local all the time at least on OnePlus devices now this feature is definitely an original one of my favorite features with OnePlus open was the OnePlus canvas and a mini version of the OnePlus canvas has been extended to oxygen os5 no you cannot have a triple window setup you can still have a double windows split screen only but now when you watch a YouTube video you can expand it much further nearly to 80 to 85% of the screen on oxygen 14 you can see that it cannot expand to this level also I like the fact that you can actually copy an image save it to file doc as and then move it to say a Notes app or a messaging app within that same split screen it's all very well done of course AI upgrades are here too and a big chunk of them are in the photos app AI unblur is a new Option so if you have a slightly blurry photo it adds details and makes it look better and the results that we got were of course very very impressive now one feature that's already there in oxygenos 14 is AI eraser but you do have a new eraser for Reflections now when I tested it out the reflections around uh the environment it was doing a fairly good job job of like you know reducing it but if the reflections were on a subject for example on a car window or on a car logo that wouldn't get erased but I still feel that it's very very useful but the new AI detail boost has to be my favorite feature you can basically crop into any picture to frame your picture according to what you want and not worry about detail loss so the AI boost actually adds more details it's called 4K UHD for some reason I don't know why but that boost is done so Tastefully that I actually liked it more than superr zoom on Pixel it doesn't look artificial which is nice so all of the AI features again inspired from other operating systems but improved in performance which is good the notes app also has a bunch of AI features and they are all specific to writing so you can format text clean up polish shorten and change the tone and elaborate this is very similar to how Apple intelligence works on iOS 18.1 iOS 18.1 has nice animations similarly green color animations are there on oxygen os5 as well it does look good of course the results of how these edits happen and how both of these edit stuff are completely different but I actually prefer Apple's job compared to OnePlus but still OnePlus is doing a fairly decent job however one thing that oxygen os does and apple intelligence does not is elaborate so you basically write a piece of text and if you want it to elaborate based on contextual information that it can find from the internet then it can do it on its own but if you ask me all the AI features added to notes feels like yes for the very first time in this whole video a copy also what I noticed is that since OnePlus uses Google keyboard you can't get all of these writing features or writing tools when you're actually maybe composing a text message which is possible with apple Intelligence on the iPhone I mean there's something called AI reply with oxygen os5 but unfortunately that wasn't working I mean AI reply would probably be like it's generating own responses depending on what message you get right and there's something called intelligent search which basically gives you contextual search results so you can ask it what times my and then it'll look through your phone and if it has the answer it'll give you the answer but unfortunately this feature was also not working in the beta that we tested however I did notice something new AI summary and AI speak when I use the smart sidebar so when you open any web page or a long text basically maybe even a PDF you can get simple summaries or make AI speak the article for you again these are things that iOS already does Arun Pro TR and techy has now transformed into a 1.4 core strong family on YouTube I do feel that the AI features in the photos app are actually pretty good but with the other aspects of the system like for example AI notes there is a little bit of Polish required but at least the foundation is there and they can start working on it on future updates and finally oxygenos 15 has also added a bunch of Android 15 features so Circle to search is here finally there's pass scan as well which scans your boarding pass and adds it to Google Wallet the default assistant can be Google gin now even gin live works I tried it out and I've been enjoying using G and Android 15's Theft Protection is here as well considering Android 15 didn't have too many features this is really nice all right so I know I haven't tested the camera performance improvements or battery life improvements primarily because this is a closed beta and all of my data would be invalid until the stable release happens but in this video I'm sure that you must have gotten a look at what are the you know new oxygen os5 features so what do you guys think do you actually like oxygen os5 do you think it's nice do you think that it's a copy of all the other features across other brands or do you think that they've used like you know basically been inspired and created interesting stuff I'd love to know your thoughts let me know in the comment section below but you know what I'll tell you this we've tested a bunch of Android 15 skins and Android 15 itself like for example F 15 nothing OS 3.0 and now oxygen os5 of all that I've tested the oxygen os5 update seems like the most number of feature updates that we've tested till now and it is also very very good until maybe one UI drops because leaks are saying that it's going to be a massive one this year by the way this is exactly what color5 is also going to be with a few design changes here and there oxy 15 is not entirely unique anymore we'll have to make peace with that all right that's it for me for this one I'll see you guys in the next one until then keep tracking and stay safe
hUeZkBJZ1Eo,Every Crazy Emerging Technology That Will Change The World,Join my Discord to discuss this video: https://discord.gg/yj7KAs33hw Every famous emerging technology gets explained in 11 ...,The Paint Explainer,2024-10-17T13:10:55Z,27,[],PT11M25S,494595,1565,,[],True,"neuralink neuralink is one of the first examples of implantable brain computer interfaces and as of now it's mostly being used for medical purposes such as improving the quality of life for paralyzed people the next neuralink missions are blindsight with the objective of restoring vision and blind patients and telepathy which is pretty self-explanatory this is the first stage of these types of technology and as time goes on we might start doing stuff like downloading information from the Internet Straight Into the brain making us super intelligent and a master at whatever task without the need to study or practice it's possible that a sort of brain internet becomes reality where we're connected with everyone else and we might even become a hive mind with immense amounts of knowledge you can imagine how incredibly powerful it would be to have every single human brain combined but this would come at the expense of individuality and with the moral consequence that people who don't join the hive mind would be severely impaired when compared against it of course this is all speculative as it's not known if it's possible to upload our Consciousness into the digital world but if it is humanity might reach immortality either by putting its Consciousness into robots or by entering a digital simulation where time is diluted thus giving us a subjective sense of immortality also super virtual reality video games where you're actually in the game might come to reality it's important to note that if all of this is possible it could come with great risk as if these types of Technologies were to be manipulable or hackable by others you'd be giving your perception to someone else for eternity enabling him to do crazy stuff like putting you in eternal hell crisper Gene editing this one is like a high Precision tool for cutting and editing DNA and when it becomes even better thanks to research it might enable us to do real life customization on living things such as changing height body shape hair or eye color and talent such as super intelligence this will of course cause the eradication of many diseases genetic and non- genetic and the rise of the use of Highly personalized Medical Treatments not only that but it could be used in crops for more efficiency more protection against parasites and more nutrients potentially eradicating famine altogether as of now the main limitation is that the stuff used for this technology comes from bacteria and for this reason the transport system to the Target site is problematic because when they are transferred to a host cell it produces an immune response against them thus disabling them another big thing is the ethical problems with this technology which causes research to be slowed down or stopped by policies such as the one by the World Health Organization which ask to put a stop to crisper experiments that cause the birth of altered humans since these types of genetic editing will probably be inheritable people say that future Generations can't give consent to the genetic changes that could affect their lives and that a phenomenon called designer babies will emerge where people design their baby just like how they want it to be playing as God also long-term side effects aren't well known so it could be seen as playing with future people's lives Quantum Computing a quantum computer uses quantum physics to perform tasks much faster than a classical computer for example in 2019 Google demonstrated that it could complete a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful classical supercomputer at the time 10,000 years to finish they're mostly better at cryptography and machine learning while it's thought that for easier tasks classical computers can be faster the machine learning part is especially important for artificial general intelligence which we'll talk about later on in the video a theory called Quantum Supremacy says that once we have better quantum computers we will be able to make them perform tasks and solve problems that can't be solved by current class classical computers giving us an incredible amount of other scientific discoveries but also completely bypassing every cryptography effort which might be problematic if cryptography doesn't find new ways to improve at the same time if someone had such quantum computers right now he could probably enter every Top Secret website or database without a problem also quantum computers might enable us to make faster and better quality simulations such as that of molecular systems thus speeding up discoveries in every field such as medicine and medical materials in our example the main challenge as of now is improving the number of Q bits while managing errors at the same time humanoid robots once AI becomes good enough for physical and risky tasks we'll be able to make them do them instead of humans to increase safety this would come with the automation of physical jobs before the automation of every single job even the cognitive and artistic ones whether it's a good thing or not is debatable every person would probably have a personal robot assistant especially for the elderly we would see the rise of robotic Sports and the use of humanoid robots for error-free surgeries also without a doubt they will be used for sexual purposes as of now the closest thing we have to humanoid robots are the ones from Boston Dynamics which you might have already seen generative AI generative AI is in its first stages as AI produced content is still detectable by a keen eye but with time it will become impossible to tell the difference from real life this comes with the democratization of content creation a similar phenomenon to the video game industry where indie developers can now produce better games than multi-millionaire Studios at some point we will be able to create cartoons films video games and education materials with a single prompt enabling each person to play customized video games created by them this will come with the eradication of many occupations which seems to be happening at a small scale with programmers and voiceover artists after AIS have gotten better at generating lines of codes and realistic speech also it will become increasingly harder to rely on videos or photos as proof be it in or for public opinion and disinformation will be much easier to spread and multiply starlink starlink is a satellite internet constellation that enables areas with no internet connection to receive it with time it will probably become the fastest data transmission method and it will be crucial for communication between planets if humans start colonizing them for this reason it's one of the most important steps for the future of long-term space missions and the advancement towards Humanity being a type 2 civilization artificial wombs artificial wombs would bypass the problem of fertility and potentially the demographic problem that hits developed countries with low birth rates its goal is to replicate the environment of the natural womb to grow baby humans and it will be one of the most crucial steps for space colonization as it's one of the only ways of creating new humans in space environments fusion power this one is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions and it's one of the most currently researched types of energy resources this could provide us with almost Limitless and clean energy in the future reversing climate change and reducing the cost of electricity to zero thus enabling us to reach the poorest zones of the world and to complete projects that would require too much energy as of now Internet of Things The Internet of Things refers to a web of smart devices connected to each other and with machine learning AI it would be able to customize itself to your preferences automatically for example if it were in your home it would be able to close the light at the right time and keep you constantly at the perfect temperature if put in cities it would be incredibly efficient for traffic flow waste management and Public Safety potentially eradicating crime in its later stage we would be able to collect real-time data about the air quality water quality how full places or parks are and we'd be able to autom manage appointments this obviously comes with the greater risk of hacking and abuse from authoritative sources to gain power autonomous cars 43,000 people in the US die from car crashes and this would potentially solve it no more driving licenses or driving training would be needed and if an autonomous vehicle could be integrated with smart cities it would be incredibly efficient in getting us to places much much faster this would come with the unemployment of taxi drivers and the reduction of needing one car per person with the rise of the phenomenon of car sharing however one of the most famous ethical problems is found in this field should automated cars prioritize protection of the passenger or of others space tourism as of now Rich tourists are able to go into suborbital flights with service like blue origin which enables them to see Earth from space but with time it will become the norm to stay in space hotels with features like zero gravity Sports to enjoy while traveling between planets the goal would be to make travel between planets as easy as traveling between countries mixed reality at one point either through the use of Technologies like neuralink or through special glasses we'll be able to fuse the virtual world into reality for example we'd be able to go into a store and see prices on items as we watch them or have virtual education environments in real life like medical students being able to perform surgeries on fake virtual patients or history students going in the actual historical time they're studying this type of Technology would also enable us to talk face Toof face to someone distant potentially removing the social problems currently caused by too much online interaction 3D printing 3D printing is only used for really specific tasks as of now but with time we will be able to print organs and tissues removing the need for organ donations and enabling us to print houses skyscreen scrapers cars Etc this would also allow for local and ond demand production without the need for long Supply chains and large inventories like we do now this would also be one of the key components for human space colonization as sending stuff from Earth to other planets could be really costly at one point we might be able to have replicators which are Advanced machines able to create anything by combining atoms such as food materials or whatever else blockchain decentralized blockchain currencies might be the primary form of currency in the future as they have the probable benefits of less inflation democratization of currency and the impossibility of Faking historical payments Financial platforms would be decentralized and people would be able to lend borrow and invest money without needing Financial intermediaries this would come with potentially less economic power for the government if it does not own the blockchain currency as it could be much more difficult to collect taxes if we take a look at the generalized benefits of the blockchain technology when not applied to money it will enable us to have better ID systems for privacy and ID protection against fraud better Supply chains in companies and even fraud-proof voting systems AGI AGI stands for artificial general intelligence and it's a more advanced level of AI that can understand learn and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks just like humans do when we reach AGI our current way of living will probably be more different than the jump humans made from prehistory to the Modern Age the fact is that it might happen sooner than we might think an exop AI employee estimated that we could reach a AGI in 2027 and the ability of AI to do research on AI creating a positive feedback loop that will cause what is called the intelligence explosion which is an incredibly rapid progress you can imagine how effective it would be by trying to picture hundreds of millions of AI researchers working on improving AI at their best efficiency night and day 24/7 with each AI researcher being 10 times faster than a human researcher this could come with an explosion of new scientific discoveries such as the eradication of every single disease and famine from the world and technologies that we can't even think about just like a prehistoric human couldn't have been able to imagine what Bluetooth is another scenario to keep in mind is that explosive technological discoveries come with explosive military discoveries such as easily accessible weapons of mass destruction that will necessitate just one criminal to destroy Earth if you want to discuss this video or suggest an idea for the next one join my Discord

don't think anybody knows how they did it in the shadows of ancient pyramids and beneath the Desert Sands the mysteries of Egypt's Advanced Technologies Whisper of a civilization far ahead of its time hieroglyphs and timeworn monuments reveal more than just a rich history they unveil a legacy of Ingenuity that challenges our understanding of the past from enigmatic structures hinting at Global Communication networks to artifacts suggesting knowledge of electricity and Aviation ancient Egypt's technological prowess beckons us to explore its Secrets join us as we journey through time uncovering the most compelling cases of advanced ancient technology found in Egypt the oseran an enigmatic underground Temple deep within the ancient city of abidos a perplexing mystery lies hidden beneath the sands of time the oseran an underground Temple shrouded in enigma challenges our understanding of ancient Egyptian history and Technology this sprawling complex with its massive Granite blocks and precise craftsmanship defies the conventional timeline of Egyptian civilization hinting at the possibility of a far more ancient origin one of the most striking anomalies of the oseran is its lack of inscriptions and decorations a stark contrast to the typical Egyptian temples adorned with intricate hieroglyphs this absence of textual evidence has led researchers to question the true age and purpose of the structure could it be that the oyan predates the dynastic period of ancient Egypt serving as a remnant of a long-lost civilization the Precision and scale of the oseran construction are truly breathtaking massive Granite blocks some weighing up to 100 tons form the core of the temple these colossal Stones were transported from the distant quaries of Aswan over 200 Mi away and fitted together with astounding accuracy the logistics involved in moving and placing these enormous blocks raise questions about the technological capabilities of the ancient Builders did they possess Advanced Machinery or forgotten methods that enabled them to achieve such Feats perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the oseran is the mysterious water that continuously flows within its Chambers despite attempts to pump out the water it inexplicably returns defying explanation hydrological Studies have revealed that the water in the oseran is remarkably different from the surrounding groundwater with a unique chemical composition and isotopic profile this anomaly has led some researchers to speculate about the existence of hidden Chambers or passages beneath the temple possibly connecting to an unknown water source some theories suggest that the osirion could have served as a center for advanced technological or spiritual practices While others propose that it may have been a repository of ancient wisdom waiting to be rediscovered the Giza power plant Theory pyramids as energy generators the Great Pyramid of Giza one of the world's most iconic structures has long been a source of Fascination and mystery standing at an impressive height of 481 ft and built with an estimated 2.3 million Limestone blocks each weighing between 2.5 to 15 Tons the pyramid's construction has baffled experts for centuries however some researchers suggest that the Great Pyramid was not merely a tomb but an advanced technological Marvel designed to harness and distribute energy the Precision and scale of the great pyramid's construction are genuinely astounding the pyramid's base covers an area of 13 acres with each side measuring 700 56 ft in length the ancient Builders achieved an extraordinary level of accuracy with the average deviation from a perfect square being less than 0.1% this Precision combined with the pyramid's Unique Interior Design has led some researchers to propose that the structure was built to generate and harness energy one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the Giza power plant theory is the presence of conductive materials within the pyramid the Great Pyramid contains several large Granite beams some weighing up to 70 tons which are highly conductive Additionally the pyramid's inner Chambers and passages are lined with highly polished Limestone which could have acted as an insulator this combination of conductive and insulating materials has led some researchers to suggest that the pyramid may have been designed to act as a giant capacitor or battery another intriguing aspect of the Giza power plant theory is the potential connection between the pyramid its underground Chambers and the Nile River some researchers propos that the pyramid's Subterranean Chambers and tunnels could have been part of a sophisticated hydraulic system designed to channel water from the Nile River and generate energy through the flow of water this theory is supported by the discovery of a series of underground channels and shafts some of which appear to be connected to the Nile the Giza power plant Theory also suggests that the pyramid's location and orientation may have been deliberately chosen to harness the Earth's natural energy Fields the pyramid is situated on a powerful Vortex of electromagnetic energy and its precise alignment with the cardinal directions could have allowed it to channel and amplify this energy obelisks potential energy transmitters the ancient Egyptian obelisks monolithic structures carved from single blocks of of granite and reaching Heights of up to 100 ft have long been admired for their beauty and precision often associated with sun worship these towering monuments have captivated the imaginations of countless Generations however some researchers suggest that obelisks may have served a far more practical and even technological purpose potentially acting as energy transmitters or components in a larger interconnected power grid the scale and precision of ancient Egyptian OB s are truly remarkable the largest known Obelisk the lateran obelisk in Rome stands at an impressive 105 ft tall and weighs an estimated 455 tons the process of quaring transporting and erecting these massive monoliths would have required Advanced engineering knowledge and sophisticated tools some researchers propose that the ancient Egyptians may have used techniques such as acoustic levitation or even anti-gravity technology to move and position these enormous Stones one of the most intriguing theories surrounding the purpose of obelisks is their potential role in generating and transmitting energy some researchers suggest that the obelisks when paired with the pyramids and other structures could have formed a vast interconnected power grid across the ancient Egyptian landscape this theory proposes that the obelisks may have acted as antennas or energy transmitters channeling and dispersing energy generated by the pyramids or other sources the idea of obelisks as energy transmitters is supported by several factors including their precise alignment with the cardinal directions their location on powerful energy vortexes and their use of conductive materials such as gold and copper some researchers even suggest that the hieroglyphs and symbols carved into the obelisks could have served as a form of coding or instructions for the transmission of energy another puzzling aspect of ancient Egyptian obelisks is the question of how they were transported and erected the most common theory suggests that the obelisks were moved using sleds rollers and ramps with hundreds or even thousands of workers pulling them across the desert however some researchers propose that the ancient Egyptians may have used more advanced methods such as the use of levers pulleys or even Sonic levitation to move these massive Stones The Great Sphinx mysterious colossal Monument rising majestically from the Giza Plateau the Great Sphinx with its Lion's body and human head has captivated people's imaginations for centuries however beneath the timeworn Visage of this iconic statue lie secrets that have puzzled researchers and challenged our understanding of History one of the enduring debate surrounding the Great Sphinx is its age while conventional egyptology dates the monument to around 2500 BCE during the reign of pharaoh cafrey a growing body of evidence suggests that the Sphinx may be far older geologist Robert shock after examining the erosion patterns on the Sphinx's enclosure walls proposed that the monument could date back to his early as 7,000 bcee a time when the region experienced a much wetter climate this theory if proven true would radically alter our perception of ancient Egyptian civilization and its technological capabilities another intriguing Theory suggests that the Great Sphinx may have been part of a larger interconnected complex designed to harness the power of the sun The Monument's precise alignment with the Rising Sun on the spring and Autumn equinoxes has led some researchers to speculate that it could have functioned as a solar powerered machine or a sophisticated AST astronomical tool the presence of a complex network of Chambers and tunnels beneath the Sphinx revealed by seismic surveys further fuels this hypothesis hinting at the possibility of hidden mechanisms or energy harnessing devices in recent years the use of advanced technology such as ground penetrating radar and seismic imaging has provided tantalizing evidence of hidden Chambers and passages beneath the Great Sphinx these discoveries have reignited Ed interest in The Monument's true purpose and the secrets it may hold some researchers believe that these Chambers could contain ancient artifacts Scrolls or even Advanced technological devices waiting to be uncovered the Sakara bird and the abido hieroglyphs theories of ancient flight in the Sands of Egypt two small artifacts have sparked a heated debate about the possibility of Aeronautical Knowledge and flying technology in ancient times the Sakara bird and the abidos hieroglyph these enigmatic objects have puzzled researchers and enthusiasts alike raising intriguing questions about the extent of ancient Egyptian Innovation and the potential for lost or forgotten Technologies the Sakara bird a small wooden statuette discovered in 1898 in the Tomb of padim men in Sakara immediately captured the attention of researchers due to its uncanny resemblance to a modern airplane measuring 7 in long and weighing less than 1 .4 Oz the bird features Wings mounted on a narrow body with a vertical stabilizer on its tail notably the bird is missing legs and its wings exhibit an advanced aerodynamic shape reminiscent of aircraft Wings rather than typical depictions of birds in ancient Egyptian art some researchers such as Egyptian doctor and model airplane Enthusiast khil MSA have proposed that the Sakara bird is evidence of ancient Egyptian knowledge of aona itical principles and may have served as a model glider Messa built a scaled up model of the bird and found that it exhibited remarkable gliding capabilities leading him to suggest that the ancient Egyptians had a sophisticated understanding of aerodynamics and may have even experimented with flying machines similarly the abidos hieroglyphs found in the temple of seti 1 in abidos have fueled speculation about ancient Egyptian flying techn technology these wall carvings discovered by Dr Ruth hover depict what appear to be modern vehicles including helicopters submarines and airplanes while some Scholars argue that these carvings are merely the result of palum sests or the layering of hieroglyphs over time others see them as evidence of a highly Advanced civilization with knowledge of aerial and underwater Transportation the Sakara bird and the abidos hieroglyphs are not the only artifacts that have prompted theories of ancient flight in Egypt other examples include the enigmatic relief carvings at the Temple of p in Memphis which depict a human figure seated in a pod-like object with what appear to be wings or blades and the Curious helicopter hieroglyphs found in the temple of Osiris at abidos which bear a striking resemblance to Modern rotorcraft Tuten Common's meteoric dagger a Marvel of ancient Metallurgy in 192 2 Howard Carter's discovery of Tuten Common's tomb stunned the world revealing a treasure Trove of ancient Egyptian artifacts and offering unprecedented insights into the life of a young Pharaoh among the many Marvels uncovered within the tomb was a small unassuming dagger that would later prove to be one of the most enigmatic and technologically advanced objects of its time Tuten kon's meteoric dagger at first glance the dagger appeared to be a work of exceptional craftsmanship with it gold handle and sheath adorned with intricate designs however it was the blade itself that really caught researchers attention unlike the bronze blades typical of the period Tuten Common's dagger was forged from Iron a material that was incredibly rare and valuable in ancient Egypt subsequent analyses of the dagger's composition revealed that it was not just any iron but meteoric iron containing significant levels of nickel and Cobalt this discovery raised intriguing questions about the ancient Egyptians understanding of Metallurgy and their ability to work with such a challenging material the process of forging a blade from meteoric Iron would have required Advanced knowledge of smelting Heating and hammering techniques skills that were not thought to have been developed until much later in human history the presence of meteoric iron in Tuten kon's dagger also sheds light on the ancient Egyptians fascination with the heavens and their belief in the divine origins of certain materials meteoric iron known as iron from the sky was considered a sacred substance imbued with the power of the Gods the use of this Celestial material in the creation of a royal dagger suggests that it held profound symbolic and spiritual significance one of the most remarkable aspects of Tuten cun's meteoric dagger is the level of crafts manip and skill required to shape and polish the blade the iron from meteorites is typically harder and more brittle than terrestrial iron making it difficult to work with using traditional Bronze Age tools now it's time for today's subscriber pick one of the most intriguing pieces of pre- Egyptian technology left by an advanced civilization that disappeared is their astonishing Stone carving and Metallurgy some structures found in Egypt are so intricate that even with modern tools replicating them would be a challenge but the most mysterious is the black colored shist disc also known as the disc of SAU this meticulously crafted Stone object features a design strikingly similar to Modern Machinery measuring approximately 2 ft in diameter the shist disc is made from a fragile stone called metail stone or shist its precision and complexity are remarkable the disc features three equid curved loes separated by small drill holes and a central Hub with a thin Hollow tube the thinness of the lobes and overall delicacy has puzzled experts as the required tools and techniques were thought Beyond ancient Egyptian Craftsmen intriguingly the shis disc resembles modern-day impellers a key component in centrifugal pumps and turbines this has led some researchers to propose that the disc could be part of a larger more advanced mechanism possibly used for irrigation water management or even energy generation what are your thoughts on this let us know in the comments the dendera light evidence of ancient lighting technology in the haor temple at dendera Egypt a series of enigmatic carvings have sparked a heated debate about the potential use of electricity in ancient times these reliefs dating back to the talic period depict what appear to be light bulb like objects complete with snake-like filaments and Lotus shaped bases the dendera light reliefs show figures holding aof large elongated objects that bear a striking resemblance to modern-day light bulbs the objects are depicted with snake-like forms inside which some researchers interpret as filaments the bases of the objects are Lotus shaped with a peculiar device beneath them that seems to be connected to a power source this combination of elements has led some to propose that the ancient Egyptians may have had access to a form of electrical lighting one of the most intriguing aspects of the dendera light theory is the absence of suot in some Egyptian temples in the haor temple for example the ceilings and walls are free from the black residue typically associated with the use of torches or oil lamps this lack of soot suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have used an alternative cleaner light Source such as electrical lighting proponents of the dendera light Theory such as electrical engineer Walter gar have created working replicas based on the temple reliefs these experiments demonstrate that a device similar to the dendera light could produce a viable if dim light source however Skeptics argue that the reliefs are merely symbolic representations of mythological scenes and that there is no concrete evidence of electrical Lighting in ancient e Egypt the serapium of Sakara enigmatic Granite boxes and precision craftsmanship deep beneath the shifting Sands of Sakara an ancient necropolis near the fame step pyramid lies a perplexing Marvel of engineering and craftsmanship the serapium this Subterranean complex a Labyrinth of tunnels and Chambers is home to 24 colossal black granite boxes each weighing up to 100 tons and displaying a level of precision that def F explanation these enigmatic containers have baffled archaeologists and researchers for centuries raising questions about their purpose and the ancient technology used to create them the boxes of the serapium measuring up to 13t in length 11 ft in width and 9 ft in height are crafted from solid blocks of black granite one of the hardest Stones known to mankind the Precision with which these boxes were cut and Polished is astonishing with perfectly flat surfaces precise 90° angles and intricately fitted Lids the scale and accuracy of these artifacts seemed to surpass the capabilities of Bronze Age tools leading many to question the mainstream explanations for their creation according to Conventional egyptology the serapium was built during the reign of pharaoh camet in the 13th century BCE to house the mummified remains of sacred apis Bulls however inconsistencies in this Theory have fueled speculation about the true purpose of the Granite boxes some researchers argue that the absence of inscriptions decorations or any trace of the supposed mummified Bulls within the boxes suggests that they may have served a different more technologically advanced purpose the questions surrounding the serapium extend beyond the boxes themselves the logistics of transporting these immense Stone containers into the underground Chambers through narrow tunnels and shafts pose significant engineering challenges the Precision and scale of the serum's construction with its perfectly aligned corridors and symmetrical layout hint at a level of technological sophistication that seems in congruous with the tools and techniques of the time the valley Temple of kafra precision and anomalies at the foot of the Great Sphinx of Giza lies the valley Temple of kafra an ancient Marvel that showcases the the extraordinary precision and Engineering prowess of its Builders constructed with massive Limestone blocks weighing up to 150 tons and faced with polished red granite this Temple has endured for thousands of years bearing witness to the rise and fall of civilizations one of the most striking features of the valley Temple is the use of enormous precisely cut Limestone blocks in its construction these blocks some of which measure up to 18 ft in length and weigh as much as 150 tons were transported from quaries located miles away and fitted together with such Precision that a thin blade cannot be inserted between them the level of accuracy achieved in the cutting and placement of these blocks is astounding especially considering the tools and techniques believed to have been available at the time another puzzling aspect of the valley Temple is the presence of advanced engineering techniques such as the use of square sockets and projecting bosses to secure the granite facing stones to the Limestone core these methods which are not found in other ancient Egyptian structures of the same period suggest that the Builders of the valley Temple possessed a sophisticated understanding of Construction principles and had access to Advanced tools and Technologies despite its impressive construction the valley Temple is curiously devoid of inscriptions or decorations unlike most other ancient Egyptian temples this lack of ornamentation has led some researchers to question the Temple's true age and purpose some have suggested that the valley Temple may have been built by a civilization that predated the ancient Egyptians one with access to Advanced Technologies and knowledge that were lost or forgotten over time the valley Temple also shares striking similarities with other enigmatic structures such as the oseran in abidos and the Sphinx Temple which is located just adjacent to the valley Temple these similarities including the use of massive Limestone blocks Precision Engineering and the absence of inscriptions have led some researchers to propose that these structures may have been part of a larger interconnected complex built by a highly Advanced civilization for purposes that remain unknown Egyptian inventions a legacy of innovation and Ingenuity ancient Egypt is renowned for its a inspiring monuments sophisticated art and enduring mythology but its contributions to human Innovation extend far beyond these well-known achievements from everyday objects to groundbreaking Technologies the ancient Egyptians left an indelible mark on the world with many of their inventions still influencing our lives today one of the most notable Egyptian inventions is papyrus a precursor to Modern paper made from the stems of the Papyrus plant this writing material revolutionized recordkeeping and communication in the ancient world the Egyptians also developed a form of cursive writing known as hieratic script which allowed for faster and more efficient recording of information compared to the older hieroglyphic system in the realm of personal grooming and hygiene the ancient Egyptians were Pioneers they created many cosmetic products including eye makeup skin creams and perfumes and wigs made from Human hair or plant fibers Dental Care was also a priority with the invention of toothpaste made from mint salt and dried iris flowers and breath mints made from frankincense and myrr the ancient Egyptians also contributed greatly to timekeeping and astronomy they developed the 365-day calendar which was based on the lunar cycle and the flooding of the Nile River they also created Sun dials and water clocks which allowed for more accurate tracking of time throughout the day in addition the Egyptians were skilled astronomers with a deep understanding of the movement of celestial bodies and their influence on agriculture and religious ceremonies in the field of engineering and construction the ancient Egyptians were truly unparalleled they developed sophisticated surveying and leveling techniques which enabled them to build the pyramids and other Monumental structures with Incredible Precision they also invented the ramp and lever which allowed them to transport and position massive stone blocks weighing several tons the ancient egyptions also made significant strides in agriculture and irrigation they developed the shadu a type of water-lifting device that made irrigation more efficient and the nyom a tool used to measure the water level of the Nile River during the annual flood season this allowed them to predict the success of their crops and plan accordingly they were also Pioneers in medicine and healthc care they developed a variety of Medical Treatments encompassing surgery Herbal Remedies and even prosthetic limbs they established medical schools known as houses of life where aspiring Physicians could hone their skills and contribute to the ever evolving body of medical knowledge Egyptian Physicians possessed a remarkable understanding of anatomy trauma and treatment as evidenced by groundbreaking discoveries such as the Edwin Smith Papyrus this this medical text dating back to 1500 BC systematically documents 48 cases of traumatic injury to various body parts it meticulously details the closure of wounds with sutures the prevention of infection using honey and moldy bread and the immobilization of fractures using splints and bandages fashioned from linen and wood other ancient Papi such as the eers and cahun delve into a wide range of medical topics including gynecology fertility contraception intestinal disease and more while many remedies involved magical incantations the Egyptians empirical observations of illness were remarkably sophisticated for their time the Jed pillar an enigmatic symbol of ancient Egypt amidst the countless wonders and Mysteries of ancient Egypt the Jed pillar stands as a Timeless symbol its true meaning and sign ific an shrouded in The Mists of time this enigmatic emblem often associated with the god Osiris and the concept of stability and regeneration has captivated the minds of researchers and enthusiasts for centuries at first glance the Jed pillar appears to be a simple stylized representation of a column or pillar with four horizontal bars or capitals stacked at top a vertical shaft this design while seemingly straightforward belies a deeper complexity and potential significance some researchers have noted the Striking resemblance between the Jed pillar and the later diagrams of Nicola Tesla the brilliant inventor and pioneer of modern electricity Tesla's designs often featured a vertical column with horizontal plates or coils bearing a remarkable similarity to the ancient Egyptian symbol this resemblance has led some Intrepid researchers to propose a fascinating Theory could the Jed pillar be a representation of an ancient Egyptian understanding of electricity and its potential applications while mainstream egyptology has long interpreted the Jed pillar as a purely religious or mythological symbol the idea that it could encode scientific knowledge is not as far-fetched as it may seem some proponents of this Theory point to the use of the Jed pillar in ancient Egyptian texts and artwork where it is often depicted in association with the concepts of power energy and the life-giving force of the universe they argue that these associations could be interpreted as metaphorical references to the properties of electricity with the Jed pillar serving as a symbolic representation of this invisible yet omnipresent energy others have taken this idea even further suggesting that the ancient Egyptians may have actually harnessed the power of electricity in their temples and monuments they point to the presence of highly conductive materials such as gold and copper in the construction of these structures and the peculiar layout and orientation of certain Chambers and passages which could have served to channel and amplify electrical currents thanks for

Reviewer: marshall8 mathers88 Will technology shape our future?
Or will we? I think Marshall McLuhan insight from
the 1960s is still relevant today. We shape our tools and then
our tools shape us. Radio and TV broadened our world view. Mobile devices and the internet changed
when, where and how we work. Cars expanded our habitats and planes
made our global travelers. Technology creates many new possibilities,
but unfortunately it is also destructive. Transportation pollutes our air. Electronic devices create huge amounts of
electronic waste and digital technologies, gave rise to big tech companies and
sophisticated surveillance systems. And it won't be long before
we have to deal with the consequences of transformational
technologies like AI and Quantum. Now, we often feel that technology
just happens to us, that we have no control over it. But
technology doesn't create itself. It's humans that create technology. More specifically, it's a small group
of people that take the lead. They are the technology optimists,
and I'm one of them. Or at least I used to be one of them. I think I'm a technology optimist
having an identity crisis. I first thought differently
about technology. A few years after having kids meet
my sons Ramsey and Jordan, and especially Jordan is this boy
with an exceptional talent for anything digital. As a baby,
he became physically wild. When he showed my iPhone
at the age of two. He knew how to switch WiFi networks
if he had a slow connection. And at the age of three, he knew 
what he wanted to become in life A YouTube star. And if you have kids,
you might recognize the situation. Your father is going to take
a picture with mommy then you’ll get 
your ice cream. But in any other situation, it looked like this and I was like a
mobile electronic store carrying iPads, game consoles, batteries, extra headsets,
you name it. And I had it with me. And although I facilitated this as a mom,
I was deeply worried at the same time. What does it do to his eyes? Will he need
glasses soon? How about his brains? Are some of the games maybe too violent?
And does he have enough friends? How are his social skills developing? As a mother, I want to limit his screen
time and force him to play outside as I did as a little kid. But I also
have another role in life. In my professional life. I'm
a part time professor at the Delft University of Technology, and I work with companies to speed
up technological innovation. Looking at Jordan as an innovation
professional, I have a very different perspective. I see his affinity and his talent
for digital technologies, and I feel I should nurture this talent and facilitate him to become
whoever he wants to be. And this put me in a very interesting
position because as a professional, I observed my feelings as a mother
with interest and I wondered, what am I afraid of? And
it triggered research. And I found that there's a historical
consistency to how people have worried and how they express these worries
about technological innovation. Basically, humans have fear technology. Since writing was the latest thing, Greek philosophers argued that
writing would be bad for our brains if we would
write everything down We don't have to remember things. It would instill forgetfulness in our
minds and make our knowledge superficial. Fast forward to the printing press. When the upper class feared that
books would spread rebellious and irreligious thoughts amongst
the common people, they feared they would lose control
over what was being printed. Newspapers would hurt social fabric
of society because until then, people physically came together to learn
about the news and talk about it. But with the newspaper, people would be in
their home by themselves reading about the news. Cinemas would
demoralize society. The TV generation would never learn
how to read or write well. And when the Internet arrived, we
saw the most bizarre headlines. The Internet was bad for everything. One of the things being it would make our
knowledge more superficial this time because you would jump 
from article to article without an interest in 
reading longer pieces. And these are just a few examples, but we see similar arguments recurring
over and over again. Loss of cognitive, cognitive
and physical abilities, loss of social skill, loss of morale
and loss of control being the most prominent ones. When we envision societal 
change through technology, we tend to frame it in terms of loss. Let’s look at an example. If you enjoyed playing with Lego as a kid, chances are you'd rather
see your children or grandchildren play with Lego over
a digital game like Minecraft. Most people immediately 
point out what you lose when you move to the digital world. Fine motor
skills and 3D insights. Kids gain another type of fine motor
skills and 3D insight in the digital world. But if you're not
familiar with those yourself, you tend to judge them as less valuable. You maybe even never mastered or tried
Minecraft essentially to digital Lego. You can mine all sorts of materials and
then craft any object you like. And because it's a digital world,
possibilities are endless. If you make a rational comparison
between the two. Minecraft comes out really well. Nevertheless, we stick to
our preference for Lego because we tend to choose what
we understand and value and are familiar with. And if you didn't
grow up with digital games, you're often prejudiced. It's bad for
your eyes, it's bad for your brain. And worst of all, you can get addicted and
that will put you in social isolation. Steven Johnson came up with a brilliant
thought experiment saying, What if books were invented
after video games? So try to imagine for a moment there are
no books, no newspapers, no magazines. You do not read, but you do 
play video games all the time.
And everybody around you does it, it’s a normal thing to do. And all of a sudden books are
invented and kids love it and they start reading like crazy.
But what we say. Chances are we would say it's bad
for your brain because, again, it's a rich multimedia experience
triggering all parts of your brain. And a book is just words on the page. It's bad for creativity and
leadership because in a game you learn how to explore and
you learn about leadership. But in a book, there's no other option
than following the plot. Last but not least, it will put you 
in social isolation because the game you play with others,
whether they’re next to you on the other side of the world, 
it doesn’t matter. But with a book a kid would be in their room by 
themselves for hours and hours reading. And this perfectly
illustrates how your frame of reference shapes your attitude 
towards new technologies. And Douglas Adams, a science
fiction writer, once brilliantly summarized
what's happening here. He shared, Everything you grew up with
is a normal part of the world. Nothing new. Anything invented between
age 15 and 35 is new and exciting, and you can probably get
a career out of it. Anything invented after age 35 is against
the natural order of things. Now, obviously, it's not this black and
white and it doesn't go for everyone. The technology optimists like me tend to
focus on the benefits of new technologies, even when they're older than 35. But lately, I can't help myself
feeling increasingly worried. We apply algorithms to define
if somebody can get a loan, only to find out later that it rightfully
discriminates against certain groups. We let algorithms define what we see on social media influencing
our political attitudes. And soon we will have AI driven
virtual friends that know us so well that we fully trust them
and follow their advice, unaware of the political or
commercial motives behind the algorithms that bring these
virtual friends to life. Looking ahead and taking into account
the fast developments in AI. I am afraid that we will lose
agency and control. I tell myself my fears are grounded that
things are different from the past. Digital technologies are all around us and
their inner workings are invisible. Big tech companies know
everything about us and control what information
we're being exposed to. Startups with a mission to
change the world for the better quickly change character after
venture capitalists pump hundreds of millions of dollars into them, forcing them to quickly scale and monetize everything they
know about their customers. Generative AI is interacting
with us as if it's human, forcing us to rethink what
is real and what is not. I feel change is happening too
fast and we can't oversee the longer term consequences. At the
same time, I know that already. In 1970, Alvin Toffler wrote about future
shock being the anxiety brought on by too much change in too
short a period of time. I know that my worries match historical
arguments against technological innovations. I know that I
didn't grow up with AI, so my frame of reference probably
informs my opinion about it, making me focus on what we lose 
instead of what we gain. This makes me wonder. Am I falling prey to the psychological
processes I've been researching? Am I simply getting old? Is my frame of reference no longer 
fitting today’s reality? The truth is, I really don’t know. And in the past, my life was simple. I was a technology optimist, helping others to see the benefits
of new technology. And now I'm in a process of recalibration, trying to figure out if I should
start warning people for the dangers that lie ahead. But one thing I do know, digital
technologies are developing at lightning speed and we do not have
the luxury to lie low. The technology optimists that work at tech
companies that shape our world focus on the benefits of new technology and
vastly underestimate their dangers and societal impact. If we do nothing, tech companies are free to develop
and apply technology as they like without any ethical or
societal guidelines they must follow. And while we're still struggling to
deal with the implications of AI, figuring out if and how we can control it, we already need to start thinking about the next transformational technology
quantum. Quantum technology. Like quantum computers, we have
the opportunity to think about the ethical, legal and societal aspects
before the technology leaves the lab and is widely applied. This is incredibly difficult, though. We can compare it to the
invention of the laser. Imagine for a moment that we are in
1960 and Ted Maiman just created the first working laser
in his lab, this big, bulky machine with a weak signal
receptive to noise. And at that point in time, we're all already trying to predict
that decades later, we will use lasers to cut through metal
print information on paper, operate on people's eyes, can
barcodes in supermarkets, or even use it as entertainment
in dance parties? It is almost impossible, bordering
on science fiction. But nevertheless, we must
try because quantum is a transformational technology
that will shape the future. We're just not exactly sure yet how, when,
where and through which applications. We need to envision these future
applications to understand its societal impact. We need to understand the
positive and the negative impact to shape a future that we want to live in. We need to start a broad
societal debate today. And I'm lucky to have a role
in this in the Netherlands, thinking about the impact of Quantum. But all of you should have
a role in it, too, because we need people from all cultural
backgrounds, religions, age, socioeconomic status. We need people
with different values and beliefs, and we need the ones who fear technology
as much as the ones who trust it. The future doesn't just happen to us. We shape technology and then technology
shapes our future. And I'm looking for people who want to
think about this future with Quantum. So I invite you to join me and help
shape our future for the better. Thank you very much."

When a person is in a bad mood, he is a good person. What did I say in the beginning, everyone is naked in the bathroom.
I used to hate his face and I decided I will not see his face anymore. Irshad, today or tomorrow you have to speak. It's going on in Irshad's mind. What was your answer? I will prefer to be quiet while showing a little understanding. Alright, India's Biggest Tech Roundtable 2024! Oh my God! We have a loaded panel here. But before starting, I want to say that we had called all the tech creators. We had called Rakesh from Gyan Therapy & Ranjeet. They couldn't come due to some reasons. But we have a panel which anyone will be proud of. Tech is influenced by these people. But that's where I'll stop & I'm going to start with a loaded question. Obviously, Irshad is going to moderate today. But this is pertinent of today's time in the tech YouTube space. There are some YouTubers who are very honest. He is honest everywhere & he is not so honest probably. I want to ask this from the panel. Because I think that is one question which goes on everywhere. You can take Reddit or Twitter. This is what happens everywhere. So I want to ask one by one. Are some YouTubers dishonest & some are honest? Let's start! Who will start? I'll start from there. Alright! So this proves that this is a loaded question. Who's going to say what? I'll go first. I think that all the creators here have their own influence. And I think that everyone is honest in their own way. Everyone collaborates with the brand. Collaborating doesn't mean that the brand will write everything for us. The brand pays us. We get paid in collaboration. It's not like we don't get paid. I'm being honest. Just like you asked the question. The control of the test is on us. How do we tell the audience? How do we show it? Sometimes the brand interrupts us. You have to remove this part. But our stand is that we have to show this part. This is a factual point & we have to show it to the audience. Yes, there are some things that the brand tries to control. But it depends on the creator. If I talk about myself, I directly say that I have to show this point to the audience. I don't know. It doesn't matter if you collaborate with me or not. And if we talk about reviews or honesty, everyone gives their honest opinion. A lot of people comment that you are saying only positive things. But a lot of people don't watch the whole video. They judge by watching half of the video. But if you watch the whole video, every creator has a negative point. You don't have to mention that you are honest. Honesty is a trait that should be there internally. You don't have to mention that you are being honest. That's why I said everyone is honest. And about the collaboration part that you mentioned, the thing that people forget is the meaning of the word collaboration. Collaboration means that you are working with these brands in collaboration. You are not towing the line all the time. Like you mentioned, we do the same. If we have to specifically talk about a product, we put our foot down on things where we say that this is something that we need to mention in the video. We have to be true to our audience which is exactly what everybody wants to do. So basically that's my point. Alright. I think honesty comes from freedom. When you have 10 people sitting in front of you with guns, it's difficult to be honest. Or for example, let's say there are a lot of people who are unable to earn a living. If they have to lie in order to earn a living, I think that's fine. But if they have money and things, they don't have to lie. That is what I feel. And as all tech creators, I feel that a tech creator is something that a normal person can't do. If you don't have an interest in tech, you can't become a tech creator. All the tech creators here, we have to get into it. We need a love for tech. And when someone loves tech, he can't hate his audience for the product. And I have noticed this with all the creators. I have talked to everyone. Now, what happens is, as much as I have noticed, for example, if a phone comes, like I remember, there was a Samsung J series phone, which I made a video on. I mean, I made an opinion video because the brand didn't send it at that time. At that time, there wasn't that much money to buy and make. But I didn't like the initial impression. The processor was bad, everything was bad. Then after 4-5 years, I was going in a cab. There was a cab driver. I asked him, how is the phone? He said, it's a great phone. I have been using it continuously in the cab for the past 3 years. And there is no problem anywhere. The display is good, the touch is good. So, in my opinion, it was a bad phone. And I was honest. But it was a very strong phone for that cab driver. So, my down the line, I understood one thing, in the matter of honesty, or in the matter of telling things, that the same iPhone is bad for one audience. And the same iPhone is very strong for one audience. So, whenever I buy a phone or a piece of technology, for which audience is it good, and for which audience is it bad, I tell them clearly, whether it is a brand, or not, whether the brand has sent it, or not. There are a lot of brands that don't work with us. There are a lot of brands that send us the first units. There are a lot of brands, which let's say, OnePlus also took us to China. I met their CEO. So, our questions don't change. The question is, why is there a green line issue? So, in our end, I don't think any tech creator is dishonest. I think their values are different. But yes, I have a lot of respect. I have a lot of respect for all the people in the tech space. Because there is no love. No one can replace it. From here, Divinder. I think there are two ways to look at it. One is that you are producing a content. You are introducing some product to your audience. You have to be factually right, as Manoj mentioned. You should not be wrong factually. That is the most important thing. You should not create things out of thin air. You don't really have to promote the product. You just have to introduce. And then it's up to the audience, whether to take it or whether to leave it. That is your most important responsibility. But where users should trust us, and where our true influence comes, is when we recommend products. Let's say we are doing a video about the best phones to buy under 15,000, 20,000, 25,000. That is where we add a lot of value. That is where we can tell them, these are the things that are important. If you are a particular kind of person, like if you like gaming, this is a product that you should go for. If you want a clean software experience, you should buy this product. And these things add a lot of value. Because if we don't do that, then it will be very difficult for them to decide and buy. Got it. But the answer to my question, this is not a question, I also want to say something about it. But I'll ask you, if this is the case, what Shlok said, what Devinder said, then why do YouTubers get the tag of honesty? And why is it like this? What's that reason? I know it's a difficult question. No, no, the question is not difficult at all. The answer can be difficult to give. Okay. The question is very simple. And if I say it in one line, everyone is naked in the bath. This is the reality. Now listen to me. How do you get that tag? Or how do those things work? I have crores in my account. I have expensive cars. My house is very nice. But if I have to upload a photo of a new phone on the internet, then I will look for the dirtiest corner of the house. And I will click a photo in such a background that just got this new phone. So that the public can see the garbage in the back corner. I won't show my best part. I mean, I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about creators. Just trying to be relatable. Trying to be humble. Trying to be like, I'm an ordinary man. If we talk about numbers, the audience has no idea. The kind of money that's running. If we talk about money, nobody has an idea. And I won't say numbers because, I mean, unless I have the permission. In tomorrow's conversation. If you have permission, everyone knows everyone's numbers. See, the thing is, what did I say in the beginning? Everyone is naked in the bath. This is the reality. You know exactly that... Okay. Here in the ecosystem. Let's say a brand launches a phone today. Not everyone gets the campaign. That's the reality. Let's say the brand works with 5 creators or 10 or 15. There are definitely people who are left out. Now that depends on their reaction. Sometimes they take this as a grudge. And after 4 days they come with their honest form. That I am honest. See, the brand didn't even send me a phone. So it becomes even more relatable. They say, he was really honest. That's why the brand didn't send him a phone. Now he is speaking the truth. Second thing is, negativity sells faster. If I praise an iPhone today, then why not praise a good phone? But if someone says, iPhone has this problem. So the iPhone which is not afforded, they will say, yes, you are right. Negativity sells. So this is the reality of honesty. In a nutshell, all of us, as an individual, we can say this line, who knows me better than me? Right. When we go to sleep at night, we all know what we have done throughout the day. This is the reality. The question here, also now after this, what happens after this, how does the audience, how do they look at this content and understand? Who is telling the truth or not? How does the audience trust the YouTuber? Just one add-on here. Audience knows everything. They know everything. They are super smart. Sometimes people try to manipulate. Sometimes a few are manipulated. But not for a longer run. At the end, they know what is going on. That's what I think. Prasad, do you have any thought on this? Same thing. Like Gaurav said, the audience knows everything. What we are doing. If you are honest, then only you can survive longer. Yeah, absolutely. Sanchit. See, it's a simple thing. If the question is understood, if the question is to tell me or not, how does a YouTuber get the tag of honesty? This is the question. What I think, first of all, there is a new trend. We have seen different trends in a long time. A new YouTuber comes. I can easily say, B-Bomb has a lot of shortcomings. I can say, you have a lot of shortcomings. And what happens with that is, people think that he is a crazy guy. He has said it on his face. He has made a mess of it. So, he is an honest guy. Basically, poking. It can be poked. So, I have been watching all this for 9 years. You guys have seen it more than me. But yes, I have noticed this trend a lot. There are new trends. First of all, your fellow YouTubers. I will say bad things about you. I will say a lot of bad things about you. I will tell you. He said this in that video. He said this. And I can show myself better. That is a way. And I don't feel bad about it. Because what can happen with this? Will my brand be created? Because in today's time… I will disagree a little. I will disagree a little. You are building your brand by making someone look bad. That is wrong. This is what I feel. Would you respond to somebody who is roasting you? See, I won't do it. Because I don't have that nature. Listen to me. I have been working in this field for more than 10 years. I have never poked anyone. Listen to me. You are my brother. You won't listen. Look, I think that in today's time, all of us are sitting here and we all have a relation with the brand. We have a relation with each other. But if I start YouTube today, it will be very difficult for me to easily fit in this industry and sit among you. Agreed. 100%. So, I will adopt a new technique. Obviously, I will adopt it to look a little better. To look different from you. To look different from you. Whether I take the help of content, whether I speak ill of you, whether I make fun of the brand. At that time, I will see the environment of the internet. So, some people are lucky to take the tag of honesty. Some people get it in the beginning and then gradually they start working with the brand. Then the tag of honesty can be removed. I came up with a lot of theories. I used to sit here with my team and keep talking that how to approach in a balanced way. So, in the beginning, we used to think that we will keep the audience at the top. First, our thought was that we will keep the audience at the top. Then we used to think that we have given a lot of priority to the brand. But I understood over time that everything is important for me.
Obviously, if the brand does not give me the unit time, then how will I make the video on time? If I don't stay true to the audience, then how will I make relations with them? How will they understand me well? Similarly, I gave top priority to everyone. And I tried to maintain a balance. And the most important thing that I think we should address is to mention the collab and put the tag of paid promotion. Yes. I mean, how can we leave this thing? Here, I want to ask one thing to Rupesh. Because he is the newest. Right? Technically not. Technically not. But his channel. Technically, yes. So, do you think when you started a new channel, did you think that you need to take the support of such things to gain the numbers? Do you think that is important? That is important because I don't think so. To a certain extent, I do not accept that honesty is due to luck. I think what he said was absolutely right. It's a very concentrated approach or show to the consumers. Consumers are shown and that is built. Before Rupesh answers, I'll just add in one thing. First, I think Rupesh doesn't need any cheap tactics to do. He has lots of talent. He doesn't need these things. This tag is shown. I'll tell you. Let's say a video of a phone is being made and 10 videos are coming. Or both titles have written real review, real search, honest review, whatever. You know, similar kind of a word is used. Now, you can see the remaining 9 on one side and one is held separately. When you search, let's say as a normal viewer who has got no idea who we people are. He has searched about a phone and he has got 10 videos. In one of them, he has mentioned in the thumbnail or the title that guy would want to go to that video because he thinks that many people don't know how internet works. Whatever he is writing, he must have said it right. Let's open it. That's how it gets built over time. That was one point. Yeah, sorry. So, personally, I hate drama. I hate drama. I hate cheap controversy. So, my clear point was that I'll make videos that I love watching. Very nice. There will be style in the video. There will be good music. So, this was the point of view from the beginning. We'll make good content. Starting, obviously, we didn't get devices. I mean, silicon was fairly new. Still fairly new. We are still not getting a lot of devices. But that was it. But I was sure that with cheap tactics, you can never gain in the long term. That is true. So, the point was that make good videos, make good content, it will automatically work no matter what you do. And I think, like everyone has added points here, that is also a point that it's the creator's responsibility to only partner with brands on good products. For example, if I have to say about myself, I make sure that if a product is not good, then I won't make a video no matter what happens. Makes sense. Okay, so now, we've spoken about the creator bit. I mean, let's break it down to the tech stuff as well because these creator things will come back. Mr. Arun didn't tell us that you've made a good video. Yes, yes. I wasn't you. He used his own name. That's what I thought. Don't feel bad for me. Alright. One thing is definite. First of all, there are two questions. One for collaboration and one for honesty. For honesty, I feel that a show is made that I am like this and it is shown in a certain way. And obviously, consumers understand. Lot of consumers don't understand. But anyway, that tag is built because things are shown in a certain way. For collaboration, I wanted to very strongly make this point earlier that till date, we must have done 500-800 unboxings. I don't know. Whatever we have done, it must have been more. It must have been more. Right. So, every video, whatever we speak in front of the camera, whatever I talk, it is backed by testing, it is backed by research, analysis and relatively, we also look at lot of other phones and whatever we speak, we speak accordingly. Many times, brands don't know, I mean, they don't like it and we don't do that video. And a lot of times, there is a fight. In fact, last year, we have said no to more campaigns than yes. So, that is what. I have also campaigned a lot. And I am sure it is true about everyone here that we can't do it. We won't do the video. So, that is, I think, that is what it is. But, what did you say about Tech Twitter? Sorry, next time, when you upload, keep writing honest. Then, it will reach everyone. But, what is the scene with Tech Twitter? We will talk about that in a bit. I will add a small thing in this. Like, if you, now people look at honesty that how much a person said negative, that is honesty. Exactly. Like, if you upload a video, then people will say, fine, there are small problems in this. Rest, everything is fine. Last time, there was a small upgrade. But, if I say the same thing, like, Apple is going to be finished. Apple is not upgrading anything. Now, they have made a useless phone. Like, Apple. I mean, if my tonality becomes taunty, then people start enjoying when I attract negativity. And, I have seen people do like, the top brands who are making good phones, who are doing all these things. One such brand, who does not have the sponsorship to give, or who never sponsors, beat him up so badly. Like, he is a traitor, he is like this, he is like that. And, from that, a narrative is made that this guy can beat up, this guy is the truth. I have seen Here, I have a point about negativity. Negativity doesn't always work. Now, there have been earlier YouTubers, they were big at one point of time. Correct. And when the boat was coming down, you know, they started making negative videos. Correct. Because if the views don't come, the brands don't come. If the brands don't come, then what will we do? We have to increase the views. If you want to increase the views, then do negativity. Many have tried like this and they have not been successful. So, what I am trying to say is, no matter what you do, the audience is very very smart. Don't compromise on your integrity. Just don't do that. Yes. I mean, just for the views, you are doing negativity, you are abusing the brand. That also does not work, I think. I will say something in 10 seconds just for the audience. Next time, whenever you watch a video and your favourite creator or random unknown creator, whatever is that person, whosoever is that person, if he says anything about any product, then always think what is the reason behind it. Is he getting angry because he didn't get the campaign? Is he getting angry because he didn't get the product? Or does he want views? Or is he targeting someone? I mean, blindly, just because you heard it, don't trust. Even if someone is saying something good, whatever that person is saying, it's always well thought, well rehearsed, well, you know, coming in from inside. So, just think once what is the main motive behind it. That's it. You know, who should trust the most? When a brand doesn't send a product to a person, doesn't get a campaign, then they should praise that person. I just did it. No, that is true. I agree. I think, I would also like to add one thing in this. I think, I have seen this trend in the industry, that a lot of creators want some units, some creators don't want units. So, those who don't want it, that creator basically, I am not taking anyone's name here, that creator basically, that phone. No, no, no. Because, I have seen, I have never done this before, but I have seen, this trend was going on. Suppose, I get a unit, but Sanchit doesn't get it. So, Sanchit bashes that phone and says, it's like this, it's bad. I am just taking an example. I am giving an example, I am not taking Sanchit's name, I am giving an example. Sanchit is the most honest. He is my brother, don't say such things. I had a counter for Shlok, which said that if someone has praised when he didn't get the product, not necessarily, we can trust. Because, who knows, that person is trying to wow the brand. 100%, 100% true. No, no, I have seen this. I had just seen a video and I had spoken to someone. I asked, is this a campaign? Trying to get the attention. Trying to get the attention from the brand that I have made a positive video. Alright, alright, guys, guys. We will move on to the next one. The next one is, I want to put it across to the panel. Do brands actually listen to feedback? Like, feedback that you provide? I wanted to ask that. Because, I have noticed that generally with the few brands that we have worked with, we have given feedback and listened to feedback. For example, Motorola, Vivo. You know, I have generally seen that they are a little more accepting of feedback. And they actually make improvements to the product as well. For example, they will tell Motorola that the camera is not good, so they are improving it. We keep talking to Vivo that these are things that you can improve.
OnePlus, I have a conversation with OnePlus. How has that equation been for you with brands? So, I think some brands listen. But some don't. I mean, I think we talk to everyone. And there are a lot of feedback calls regarding the OS, the hardware, everything. Camera, UIs. And I have had a lot of these conversations and video calls. But I think only a few brands actually listen and make changes. Do you have a problem with that? No, it's fine. Obviously, my task is to give them feedback. It's on them. We will let you know as soon as their product comes out. I think in terms of feedback, Motorola takes the best feedback. Vivo too. Vivo and Motorola, both are serious in my opinion. In fact, Motorola has made so many changes based on our discussion with Shivam. I mean, I really want to point that out. It's very accepting. In fact, I would like to say one thing here. The people of India, these are all Chinese, South Korean companies. But the management sitting here, they really drive. If those are the right people in right places who are looking at people, taking feedback. It makes a lot of difference to the actual product that they launch. I mean, a lot of times, I think a few of the brands won't even have, they won't be able to make changes either. Like a lot of decisions happen not in India. And India is just like a centre where they are selling these products. Probably importing or making it here. So that can also be an issue. I would add to that. What I have seen, just like you said, Motorola gives good updates to everything. The brands whose primary market is India or they are making India-specific units. Give them feedback, they know that our business is going on from here. They make changes quickly. And they upgrade quickly. But if there is a big brand that is international. If I am giving them feedback that the skin tone is not according to Indians. Then they are selling in China, South Korea, US. So maybe they are not optimizing the skin tone just for India. So I have noticed that India-specific brands change very quickly. The international ones, their feedback goes to the groups. Tell me, which is not an India-specific brand? All of them, in my view, who are selling here. India is such a big market that it has to be your top 1, top 2 market. And they have to give that importance. For reference, like Apple or Samsung. Samsung S24 series is also sold internationally. It is sold equally in all countries. But there are a lot of India-specific variants, India-specific units. I will say CMF or nothing. Even if it is international positioning, but India is a major market. But I have seen that the skin tone of the iPhone is different for the US and India. I have seen that. Yes, yes. When it comes to the camera, it is generally about the skin tone. Because skin tone is important. No, I am just generally saying that. That's the one thing that we can immediately tell the brand. Skin tone is something that you need to sort of tune for. In this, Vivo is very aggressive. In Vivo, V1 chip, all these chips. I have heard that they are very aggressive. Because in Pixel, they keep talking about real tone. But it is never tuned for brown skin. And I have mentioned that in my reviews multiple times. I have always noticed this. Alright, so now I want you guys to take the slate out. The slate is in front of you. And the question is very simple. Your favourite brand of 2024. Please write it down and show it to the camera. In terms of what? Progress. And it can be across brands, not just smartphone brands. I mean you can figure out what you want to say. But a tech brand. It is a question to ask tech brands. I am asking you. What is your favourite brand of 2024? We will ask you the reason. Do we have to write it down? Favourite or least favourite? Actually, let's do that. Let's do both. Let's not do not favourite. Let's do brands who could have done better. Will the question change? No, no, no. Write two answers. Favourite brand and brands who could have done better. A brand that could have done better. Alright, let's go for it. And everyone show at the same time. We are talking about 2024, right? All the phone launches. 2024. Don't take it to my answer. Alright, everybody is ready? This is only 2024, this year. Favourite and brands who could have done better. That is right, that could have done better. Only one, right? Favourite and brands who could have done better. Alright. We are ready? Don't start with me. Alright, show everyone. Show. Alright, there you go. Okay, let me see the answers. We have the same answers. Oh, we do. That's because we work together, Arun. Okay, CMF and nothing. Redmi is the one that could have done better. Redmi could have done better. CMF is my favourite brand. Okay, so who has written Redmi? Okay, now I want to know your reasons why. Yeah. Honestly, I don't know what happened. Yeah, same. 2016-17. Apple? But I have also written Motorola. Because I feel... Okay, please. Back in 2016-17, the Note series used to launch, right? So there was hype. We had to buy it. Redmi Note 5, Note 5 Pro. We didn't even get it. You had to do it. Let me tell you, we didn't get the Note 5. That's why we were literally sulking for 2 days. Because we didn't get the unit. We had to buy it in black. We used to buy it in black. Wow, I remember that time. What happened to Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus? We had to buy it in black. Yeah, I bought it in black. What are you saying? Because of flash sales. Because of flash sales, people were buying extensions. Oh yeah, just a squeeze. I am telling you what happened with Coldplay ticket. It has happened before in our tech industry. Redmi did a different business. I know people who have earned 15-20 lakhs from Affiliate during just the sale period. Before they got to know that people are doing this. Just by providing the plugins and their Affiliate code in the plugin. Wow. Yeah. I mean there was a different business there just because of the flash sale. What was your answer by the way? What was your answer? I have written my favourite is Motorola. But it's written in real. I haven't written the other one because there is no one. I mean I can add in for everything. Okay fine fair enough. He has done such a good job. Everyone else has done it somewhere. This is cheating. Mine is also Motorola. Everyone's is Motorola. Motorola is your favourite. And Infinix is not your favourite. Infinix is not your favourite. Motorola. That's very interesting. Infinix is not your favourite. Mine is not Motorola. There is Vivo and iQoo. Same brand. There are many reasons. Like in Vivo's X100 series I enjoyed it. X100 value. And in 200 I enjoyed it more. Honestly speaking. It's fantastic. In fact for iQoo I will say whenever I have to make a video best smartphone under 15, 20, 25, 30. My top priority is for some reason iQoo. I mean it's like what specs they have given. It's like that. This was not of favourite smartphone. It was of favourite brand. I mean the brand which did the best. So yours is more towards because their smartphones were good.
That's why I want to be technically right. I want to probe the Infinix bit. What do you mean by Infinix? Infinix. They have launched very good phones in 2024. But when I test Infinix's phone. I don't know. Saru saw where the least business comes from. It's not about business. It's not about business. But I am telling you honestly. I don't like their UI. I seriously don't like it. You don't like the UI much. Fair enough. Saru has opened his exoskeleton. A lot of people have written Apple. I have also written Apple. Let's ask Devinder. Let's talk about favourite brand. The thing is I know that everyone would be writing Motorola. Which is obviously good thing. Because Motorola has launched such good phones. But the one brand that is underrated and has done really well is I think Meta. What a good point. Yes. But there is no existence in India. They have been really well collecting your data or something. Collecting your data. That's right. They have been really well. All the smartphone companies do that. So what to say. I will tell you why. I am still wrapping my head around it. But that's a good answer though. I will tell you why. There are two reasons. One is the Meta glasses. They are one of the best products that have come in the market. That he is wearing it right now. You are wearing one. And you have been wearing for one long year I think. I have been wearing it since I bought it. And you don't use a product if you don't like it. You like it that's why you are using it. That is one thing. And that is an extension to the mixed reality headsets. Because when the glasses will be like this then only more and more consumers will actually be using it. Devinder, just one thing about this Meta bit. Is that everybody, legit everybody. You know that the product is good when every tech creator when they go abroad. The first thing they want to go and buy is the Meta. Exactly. And the second thing is Orion glasses. They showcased. Even you have one. Second thing is Orion glasses. They showcased it. It is a prototype. It will take time to come in the market. But that is exceptional. I was there. I saw it first hand. And I am supremely impressed. How can they make such a good product? Tell us a little bit more about it. I think you are the only one who experienced it. They didn't let us obviously use it. But we can see it. We saw the demo. And it was like. There is a lot of it that you can control just with the eye tracking. Is it as good as the Vision Pro? The display is not as good as the Vision Pro. Of course. But they wanted to say. If you use the Vision Pro. Then you wear it in public. And do like this. You look like a little challenged type. So their idea is to. Eye tracking or Neuro tracking. They have their band. And the glasses. You can just use it. No one will know that you are using it. How you are interacting. You can overlay. AR overlay will be on the top of the products. All of these things. So I am very very impressed. And I am looking forward to it. And Apple? Apple. I was there at the iPhone launch also. So the thing is. I was expecting a lot more from the Glow Time event. You didn't like the camera control? The camera control is so good. It's the best. What are you talking about? The camera control. Even I don't like it. Nobody likes it. I am being sarcastic. It's terrible. I know. I mean. We are thinking that the buttons will be less. They are increasing it. And there is no use for it. You won't believe. Since I am using it. I haven't used it even once. Same. Seriously. It's like a new one. It's good. You do? There is an opposing view on this. Not an opposing view. I am talking about both. I think Meta is a poor brand. Which is doing a good job. Which is being negative on the internet. People don't acknowledge. That's what I am saying. Meta is underrated. I have this opinion about Apple. That Apple is so big. So big. It doesn't matter if we like it or not. The thing is. The reality is. Apple can't experiment. Do you think Apple can't make foldable technology? Or Apple can't do anything else? They can do everything. True. But the thing is. They take every step carefully. Because a small deviation. Will impact them. In a big way. The new brands. The small brands. Sometimes they will do everything. Put a light on the back. No. Nothing was original. I am saying nothing else. I know what you mean. For example. The one who copied. Yeah, I know. You are right. They can do anything. It doesn't matter to them. They have to stay on the limelight. I know people. Who don't care about it. Because Apple is so big. That they can't experiment. But what about the camera control? Do you like it or not? I am coming back to that. I will tell you. The problem. What happened with camera control. In my opinion was. Apple wanted. People to use it like this. And like this. Because of that. It's positioning has gone up. It's not comfortable like this. If it was down. Might have been useful for some people. Because the way it works and all. If the positioning was better. I will tell you. Find a better application. Justification is fine. No. No. No. I am justifying. I am justifying. I am saying. What is going on in their mind. Because. See. The position there. They had shown in the demo. You can use it in this way. By the thumb. And from here too. Because of that. Positioning has gone up. Because if you try using this. This is where your finger would land. But camera control falls here. It falls inside. Same way when you do it here. It falls down a little. So what he is trying to say. That button is not useful now. That is what his point was. Practically. Because of the position. If they had added finger print instead. It would have been better. You too. You too. Face ID is good. It's fine. No. No. I don't know. I don't know. Whatever. One minute. Arun. I have one point. You were saying that. Apple is taking a big step. It is taking a big step. Because. What is taking a big step? Step. The thing is. Samsung is also a big brand. They are experimenting a lot more. Their philosophies are completely different. Right. Samsung and Apple. Samsung. Still is. Kind of you know. Young brand in terms of. See. For Apple. iPhone is the biggest cash crop. Apple is the most cash rich company. I know. No. If they don't experiment. But. That's how the reality is. See. Today as we speak. Do you think that. Apple didn't lock iPhone 17 already. Or they didn't lock iPhone 18 already. Do they know. What they are going to give? Sir. I was talking to. You know. The cycle goes on for 3 years. The product is made 3 years before. So. Those things are there. Right. So. I was talking to. I was talking to. I was talking to. I was talking to. I was talking to. So those things are there. But the innovation cycle is decreasing. That's why it lost some time. I will also say same thing. Innovation. Has been lost somewhere. In means this became a marketing company. Rather than. They have strong product obviously. But there has to be something. Everytime Steve Jobs used to come at that time. He used to come up with something new. One thing used to be like this. Which would attract you to the product. Yes. Now it isn't like this. Always. Can I add something? Yes. I will just add one thing. I have this phone for example. We have all seen it. The tri-fold. Okay. It must have taken a lot of effort to make this. Yes. Do you agree with this? Yes. But the way we are exposed to tech products right now. I think our threshold has increased so much. That it has become very difficult for us to please a brand. I still remember in 2019. When the first fold came in. It was a magical device. Yes. Now if I show a kid. If I show a fold to a 10 year old kid. For that it's like. Okay it's done. Sometimes we are too harsh. We don't appreciate. How much effort it takes. Okay. Let's take a little bit on that side. We have seen everything. We have seen from rollable phones. I will come to the foldables bit in a bit. To TVs. To this that everything. That it has become very difficult for brands to wow us. I 100% agree. I would like to give my perspective. Like camera button and me too. Because I love iPhones a lot. Personally if I am honest. What? We all love it. With whom do you do it? That was the bigger question. With Apple. With Apple. But yes. I will add a little bit. In this. I feel that. Apple. Because the phone is strong. I mean it will be in the best phones. All the top phones. Samsung, Apple, Oppo. Now Apple must be thinking. What should we do differently. To differentiate from the old ones. If I remove the camera button in this. Then. Such a big upgrade is not seen. So I think. Apple is trying small things. To experiment a little bit. To make it different. But not so much. That it becomes too different. The experiment done in the photos app. I will give you. I have this. I showed a reel. So he told. How to organize it better. You have done that. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. It might be 120Hz this time. The reason is... It might be. See now. The reason is really a fan of Apple. For 60Hz. I am not giving any justification. I am telling you what their thought process is. I am not giving any justification. It should be 120Hz. 120Hz is better than 60Hz. There is no doubt about it. But the thing is, the people who are buying an iPhone, the iPhone 15 users, they don't care about it. They still want an iPhone. No, no. The people who play games, they care about 60Hz. Again, this cannot be a justification. Lot of gamers are using iPhone. See, I will tell you something. When any brand makes a product, they take care of two things. Number one, the features they are giving, they will give minimum where they are able to meet the threshold for the masses. Okay. As long as they think that 60Hz can work, they will stay at 60Hz and not go to 120Hz. Now when they feel the pressure, they will move to 120Hz. We are making them feel the pressure. So listen. Number one, every brand when giving or designing any product, they keep the set of features at bare minimum to meet the threshold so that the costs are low. And while they price the product, they would want to price it as high where they feel that they can take out this much money from their pocket. That's how the game plays. No, no. Just to maximize the profits for any brand. So, the point here is that because Apple knows that it can work, because of this, they are not thinking about the consumer. That is where my biggest complaint is. Exactly. That is what I'm saying. Okay. Let's move. Yeah, sure. Of course. But before that, I just want to probe Rupesh on his best brand. He wrote CMF by nothing. You think I'm not going to ask you about it? No, no. I know there's a... There was some news about Blast. No, forget that. That's your reasoning. My reasoning is, you know, I as a creator and also as a tech-loving person, I love value for money products. Good point. Toko F1, Redmi K20, Redmi K20 Pro. When the K20 and the K20 Pro came, they legit... Exactly. So, I loved it. And when the CMF Phone 1 launched, even now, I don't think there's a better phone in that price range. Agreed. But I love value for money products. Everybody thinks the same about CMF as a brand. CMF is actually one of the best gaming phones under 15,000, if you look at it. Yeah. Price to performance ratio is very good. Very good. Moving on. Come on. We were talking about Apple, right? Now, there's one thing that I feel genuinely, like, you know, and I made a video about this and specifically I did. I feel like, the advantage that Apple had in the processor, the camera, I mean, at one point, it used to have an advantage. Not anymore, obviously. All of that is like, it's in the two generation gap. Whatever processors they use, A18. And now I feel like, with Android phones, they're actually at the level of iPhones. Sometimes even better. Is that true or not? Let's take a slate here and we'll do favorite Android UI and then we will... Let's do that. Yeah? Let's go. Favorite Android UI of 2024. Beta? Yeah. What specifically? This shows you're a tech nerd. This shows you're a tech nerd. No, but the point is, even if you want to write iOS, you can write iOS. 1.1.2. If you want to write iOS, you can write iOS. No problem. But it was for Android. No, he said... You can write iOS. He can write. Who's better than iOS? Alright. Let's show. Reveal. Is everyone done writing? Yes. Let's do this. Devendra doesn't want to respond to any brand. Do you want to write on Android? It's the same thing. Both are the same. Wait, wait. I'll read it out. One UI... Do you want to write on Android? iOS! Do you want to write on Android? No, no. Android or... Between Android and iOS, do you like iOS? Android is oxygen OS. Oxygen OS, okay. One UI and color OS. One UI and... What's... It's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's color OS. Fair enough. Interesting, right? What did Rupesh write? Nothing OS and oxygen OS. I have to be specific. One UI and seven, right? One UI and seven. Okay. I have to be specific. One UI and seven. I'll also write seven. Shlok, what did you write? One UI. Okay, one UI. What happened? Even nothing OS is really good. Nothing OS is really good. Tell me about one UI. I really liked 2-3 things about one UI. First, it is stable and secure. These two things are rare in Android in general. Because there are hot apps, hot games, and many more. There are many more. Yes. It's genuine garbage. Those who know about tech know this. So, those two things. But one thing I liked more is that AI features are in many phones. Samsung has done a good thing. Samsung has developed AI features themselves. I liked that a lot. They have built many brands with collaboration. But they have developed it themselves and they have developed it inside the phone as well. Like there are a few cameras. So, I found that to be very different. Yes, it is a step forward than all the other brands. I completely agree with  you.  If you see right now  If we see now, One UI is the only one, where the Galaxy AI is complete and usable at every place there are so many features which you can actually use "

I wasn't expecting this much but when we tested it, I was pleasantly surprised. If you hold the phone in your hand, it doesn't feel like it's a 1st generation product. Seriously, good job Infinix! I'm going to say this earlier because when we test a device, there's an expectation. And when it goes beyond that expectation, you feel good & that's what Zero Flip is. And there are some things that I'm going to tell you about it. Watch it carefully till the end. You'll come to know everything about this. This is the most affordable flip phone. It's net effective price is Rs 45K. That means flip phones have been democratised. If it comes below Rs 50K, it means it's a mass appeal phone & it's a flip phone. So yeah, that's it. Let's start with the Zero Flip phone. It has boxes, which is good because sometimes there's only 1 thing in a big box. They give the 70W adapter, which is not bad. It's a USB Type A adapter. What else is there inside? I think this is the cable. There's a Type A to Type C charging cable & there's a case as well. So there's documentation, a sim card tool & then there's the case. Let's put the case aside & look at the phone. There are 2 colours, this is black & there's another pink colour. By the way, this is a glass metal sandwich design. This is also glass & this is metal. You can see the internal lines. It's nice to hold in hand. I actually like the hinge. You can open it with 1 hand. You can easily open it with your thumb as it's a flip phone. It's even easier with the thumb. It's not bad. The weight is 183g. Let's try 184-183g. It's 201.8g. It's 201g. But when I open it like this, it feels a little heavy on the front. That's why I thought it's so heavy. No, I still feel it's around 188-185g. Let's move on. There's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 at the front & Gorilla Glass 7 at the back. And obviously there's a UTG Ultra Thin Glass inside. Let's do this. No, nothing. I'm scared from the back. Oh, this is beautiful! I think they've put a scratch guard over the glass. And you can't take it out. You can take it out, but it'll reduce the weight by 1-2g. Let's remove this. There's a scratch guard. Oh, nice! Build Quality is absolutely great. Even if you look at the hinge & it's written Infinix on it, it looks premium. It feels like a sturdy phone in your hand. And definitely it's well built as well. So in terms of build quality & durability, it's definitely a thumbs up! Let's quickly put the case on & look at this. Even good job on the case! You can open it with just 1 hand. And you can hold it like this. I'll definitely say that Infinix hasn't cut the corners to make this flip phone. Ports & Buttons You get a sim card tray, USB Type C, speaker grill. On the right, there's a power on off button with fingerprint sensor & volume rocker. There's a noise cancelling microphone on the top & nothing on the left. There's only 1 variant of SIM card tray, 512, so even if you don't have an SD card, it's fine. There's a dual nano sim card slot. Let's start the phone now. If you're new to our channel, then do subscribe to our channel. We've done this video in collaboration with Infinix. But I'll tell you what I think about this phone in this video. First, let's talk about the cover display. It's the biggest cover display in this segment. It's a 3.64'' AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. It's a very useful display with panels. But you can actually add apps here. You can watch YouTube here. You can watch Instagram, our shots etc. Let's check out the audio. Not bad at all! You're going to get used to it. You can follow a lot of things on the screen. We've tried playing games on it. You can't add icons, but we've turned it around. We've installed Google Play Store here. And you can play games on it. You can actually play on this screen. For eg, there's BGMI. And look at this! The cover screen is not just for the name sake. You can keep pets here. Absolutely no problems! It has a close integration with Gemini. So if you want to converse with the AI on the screen, you can do it. The display inside is tall. It's a 6.9'' FHD+, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display. It means it has an adaptive refresh rate from 10Hz to 120Hz. So that's good. The colours & panel quality are excellent. And as mentioned before, it uses UTG. The crease is very less. If you can see this. If you use it a lot, it'll increase a bit. But when you buy a new one, the crease is very less. We've seen other phones with a lot of crease. The outer display is 1100 nits brightness & the inner display is 1400 nits brightness. And this is a zero gap hinge. So let's test the paper. Oh yeah! You can see, it's a single paper & this is a double paper. I'll keep it as a single paper. This is a strong hinge. If I talk about the hinge, Infinix has said that it'll last upto 4 lakh folds. So even if it's 2-3 lakh folds, you can use it for 4-5 years. So again, the durability & hinge are all good. Multimedia Displays are absolutely nice. You'll have a good video viewing experience. It's very tall, so you won't get the upper bands. Sometimes you'll get the black bands on the sides. But you're going to enjoy that. There are JBL tuned speakers, stereo speakers. You'll like the quality. Overall, the multimedia experience is decent. You'll get HDR support on YouTube & not on Netflix. You'll be able to do full HD streaming on Netflix. Performance This is not a performance oriented phone. But it has a Dimensity 8020 processor. It has LPDDR4X RAM & UFS 3.1 storage. And the AnTuTu score is around 7.8-7.9 lakhs. Which is decent. You can play 60FPS games on HDR & play upto 40FPS. But I liked that it has a big battery. It has a 4720mAh battery. You get a 4720mAh battery in many normal candy bar phones. But in this foldable phone, you get a 4720mAh battery. And it has 70W charging. So there are absolutely no problems. It doesn't support 10W reverse wireless charging. Performance This is not a gaming phone. But if you're going to play games on it continuously, it does heat up a bit. So it heats up a bit. But I have to say that the thermals are fine. And we saw that the CPU throttle score is around 65-70%. So that's ok. Variants It has 8GB RAM, 512GB storage & 8GB virtual RAM. Sensors It has a side mounted fingerprint sensor, face unlock & works well. Connectivity It has WiFi 6 & NFC support. All the prominent bands in India support it. No problems there at all. It has an Air Blaster 2, not an Air Blaster. UI One thing that you have to test in foldable & flipable phones is the optimization. How do you move from a large screen to a smaller screen when you shift? If something has opened, it has moved to this side. They have done a good job in optimizing. Again, it doesn't seem like a 1st generation product in terms of hardware & software. We didn't notice any bugs in the tests we did. Updates It comes with XOS 14.5 which is based on Android 14. It has 2 years of major updates & 3 years of security updates. It has AI features like AI Wallpaper Generator. It has Volex Voice Assistant which is integrated with Gemini. So it's a voice assistant, you can talk & converse with it. It will talk to you with love. It has features like AI Eraser for battery health. There's an AI charging assistant so all those features are there. Cameras It's an Infinix phone & we don't expect it but I was pleasantly surprised by it. There's a 50MP camera on the front & a 50MP selfie camera on the back. I don't know whether to call it a selfie camera or not as the rear camera is on the front. So there are 3 50MP cameras. If I talk about the quality of the photos, it's good with clarity & sharpness. The photos you take for social media are a bit punchy & warm. By default, the photos you take for processing are social media worthy. I won't say it's natural as people don't like it. But there are some punchy & warm tones. We've taken a lot of photos & I'm giving you the G-Drive link. So do check it out if you're planning to buy this phone. Interestingly, you can take photos with all the 4K cameras. You can take selfies with the front, back & the inner camera. But the front cameras give 4K at 30FPS & the inner camera gives 4K at 60FPS. That's interesting. There's another phone from Infinix that has a partnership with GoPro. The GoPro app is pre-installed. And if you have a GoPro, you can directly control it from here. So if you're into that. Features Because it's a flip phone, you can use it as a DV mode. Then you have AI Cam, Video Mode, Portrait Mode, Vlog Mode, Super Night Mode, Time Lapse, Slow Motion, Dual Video Mode, SkyShop, Long Exposure, AR Shot, Pro, Super Macro Mode, Panorama, Document Scanning, GoPro. Obviously you'll have to pair your GoPro & then you'll be able to use it. If you want to take a photo from here, you can do this & it'll click a picture. So it supports gestures too. Features It has FM Radio, there's no notification light. You can keep pets, there's AOD, you can customize it. And yes, there's no IP certification. There's a dual LED flash in selfie mode. So that's there, if you're taking a selfie in the dark. So friends, I really liked Infinix's Zero Flip in terms of durability. Even the cameras have improved. For the price, especially the net effective price of Rs 45K, you're getting a good decent flip phone. Yes, this is the Infinix Zero Flip. If you have any questions, do ask them in the comments. If you have anything else, please do let me know. That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"

musk', 'elon musk drone', 'drones', 'uap in new jersey']",PT39M47S,604659,8751,,[],True,"live in New Jersey these drones are on top of my house every single night and here's why I really think they're [Music] aliens and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in about I don't know 20 miles or closer do you remember when I made that video and I spoke about that computer software that predict icted a particular event that was going to happen from the 3rd or the 4th of December onwards is this what they're talking about the situation in New Jersey with the uaps has gone from crazy to ridiculous what's occurred within the last few hours is madness I've got a few bits of footage I'm going to show you okay but I wanted to make this video um because there is a very Split Decision as to what and where these uaps are coming from are they man-made or are they Alien made right alien technology I don't think we can get the answers by asking who what where right maybe it's it's why are they here why New Jersey because maybe if we can find out why then maybe we could find out who right so if we were to ask ourself why why New Jersey okay there's two things that come to mind one is the most populated state in the whole of the United States per square mile the most populated state okay so if you're an if you're an alien and you wanted to observe us wouldn't that be a perfect location and not only that if these uaps if these aliens are coming from the ocean it's sat right next to the North Atlantic right so you pop up out of the water you come across you do a little bit of observation if if [ __ ] goes down you can quickly Escape go back underwater maybe this is the reason why these sightings AR really coming from Inland right they're also reaching up near the um the capital of the United States New York okay in the lagu is it the lagu uh LaGuardia Airport in LaGuardia Airport that I've got footage now of UFOs uaps over there they're spreading they're getting a little bit more cheeky right so this would tell me that if it was alien Tech this is a perfect perfect place but then if it's human Tech a lot of people saying that it's testing they're testing these new drone equipment out but would you really test that equipment brand new equipment over the most densely populated state in the whole of the United States cuz some people are saying that this is Elon Musk if these are drones the size of small cars especially when it's cold weather as well drones stay up in the air for a maximum of 20 minutes who's got good batteries well Elon Musk is invested a lot of money a lot of time a lot of dedication into you know making incredible batteries so I had a little look at it is Elon Musk doing anything to do with drones in 2017 Elon musk told the world he was certain that artificial intelligence would lead us to World War II his viral comments evokes visions of Terminators feet crushing apart of skulls robotic airplanes hunting down humans now however it appears musk has changed his mind in a series of recent posts on X mus has become um a vocal advocate for replacing man Jets like f F35 lightning 2 with drone swarms controlled by AI Hive mines Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinting at drone production Morgan Stanley here we go Morgan Stanley Tesla Inc drones is it me or are you seeing more breadcrumbs from Tesla's CE potentially connect Tesla Aviation basically he goes into shares if he gets involved with drones um aircrafts you know uh shares could go up to $1,000 I'm not too sure what do you think is it anything to do with Elon Musk I think it's a bit of a stretch if we're going that far um there was another one that I saw Joshua boner look into these companies andreil and pretto Dynamics big money and big moves within AI surveillance drone defense one is lucky Palmer former founder of oculus well sorry Paul mlui that was his name um that is his name he's a bit of an oddball him because he did create this virtual reality headset that was a oneoff apparently and apparently if you played this game and died in the game the headset would make you in real life Palmer lucky um defense company so what hell pman lucky def so he is actually the CEO of Palmer lucky death headset Palmer lucky made a VR headset that kills the user if they die in the game so this is the person that has started up this company he is the founder of this company so it looks like andil is creating a drone an AI operated drone there's also quite a fair bit of History regarding UFOs over in New Jersey then 2001 the Carterette UFO incident Carterette New Jersey and surrounding areas including New Jersey Turnpike uh multiple Witnesses including the law enforcement and truck drivers reported seeing a series of strange lights hovering over the New Jersey Turnpike for about 15 minutes the lights were in a v-shaped formation and did not make any sound the FAA and the local authorities could not explain the phenomenon and remains one of the most famous UFO cases in New Jersey the oneq reservoir incident Witnesses including police officers reported seeing a bright glowing object hovering over the the reservoir the object repeatedly admitted a beam of light that appeared to interact with the water some described it as a disc-shaped craft the event led to widespread media coverage at the time the great Airship wave of the late 1800s during a wave of sightings of mysterious airships across the us there reports from New Jersey residents about seeing large cigar shaped crafts in the sky these incidents occurred before the uh the Advent of airplanes and sparked National curiosity UFOs at New Jersey Shore common reports include strange lights over the ocean triangular-shaped objects and unexplained hovering Crafts near popular beaches like Seaside Heights and Cape May some reports ongoing reports and modern sighting some reports have increased in recent years coinciding with the broader public interest of UFOs especially after the US government released dis classified information about the unidentified identified aerial phenomena the UAP New Jersey has an active communities of UFO enthusiasts and discuss sightings and theories so it's quite a hot place for uaps to hang out right and so again that argues for it to be alien Tech now also we've got technology called orcus that can basically fire a a signal or a beam of some sort and drop drones from the sky okay this is our defense mechanism for drones but apparently this frequency is just something we've we don't know about listen to this we had this report from the New Jersey State Police now admitting that they have revealed that unidentified drones are operating on a frequency that cannot be detected okay we can't detect the frequency we don't know amidst the state the the uh new JY um State Police we don't know what these things are new not just a frequen that we can't Jam but also undetectable in radar is there any military activity out straight ahead of us no uh we're not seeing anything uh I had another report at like 30,000 ft in the Eugene area we're not sure what it is yeah there's lots of moving out there 156 yet they're they're looking into it it's we're seeing three or four targets you know they're all altitudes up and down it's pretty crazy I there was some at 30 probably but I mean they're shooting way up I we say maybe up to the 50s it looks like is there traffic actually out about uh our 2 to 3:00 about I don't know 20 30 miles no is that that uh the four different lights going up and down I'm getting a few reports but uh you're seeing it right in front of you now to as well uh it's 2 to 3:00 off uh yeah about 2 to 3:00 from our position look about 20 miles going in [Applause] circles medac one yeah we're not seeing anything getting a lots of different reports out there uh some at 30 some all the way up to 50,000 about three four different lights does it look like they're around your altitude now uh no there's one way up high and one about my altitude um moving in like like a circle like a cork screw pattern all right I'm I'm um VIs Have Eyes on what looks like a aircraft strobe that's at my 2:00 and 22 mil at my uh altitude I'm actually showing him on TCAP do you see that one I do not he looks like he's U moving towards it looks like it's moving towards the north uh like I said 22 22 and half miles off my right wing just had another one show up about my uh 1:00 uh about 1,000 ft High zipping towards us and then back out towards the ocean red red in color um moving at extreme speeds I don't I don't even know how to describe that F Roger you are cleared to maneuver as necessary left or right to avoid the UFO out there it's weird it's a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in about I don't 20 mil or closer to us and it zips back out of the ocean and we can't see it is there military activity out straight ahead of us no uh we're not seeing anything uh I had another report at like 30,000 ft in the Eugene area we're not sure what it so he literally said there that these uaps are moving to and fro from the from the from the ocean to land back again moving back and forth bit like this video this is this is what I'm saying this has been going on for years and yes okay these are the these look different to what your stereotypical uaps look like right but this is this video I'm going to show you now this is from 1994 this is what's been happening for so many years we either being surrounded by Fring UFOs or the coast guards I want us s there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 lights we see there they've been coming on they were seven lives here is some live footage of uaps coming out or coming from the ocean okay in Island Beach State Park and not only that someone's actually managed to capture what looks like some portal of some sort in the sky right live cam on C bright Beach webcam this is what they're referring to some sort of portal opening up what this was captured live people are going be saying Tesa that's not that's not that's not Tesa rocket but what is that and here's an interesting video as well a lady is recording off of her balcony you actually see the scale of what's going on here but something crazy is going on in the sky it's not just the uaps take a look at this okay so for context this is what you're going to see in the next video this is the view off my balcony that is South Jersey that is Jersey City over here is New York City there is nothing in this area there's no stadiums no cities no Bridges nothing watch this Sky now down now I'm not too sure what's going on with the audio sounds like some sort of noise cancellation cancelling a voice or something like that but what sort of Direction so what did she say okay for context this is what you're going to see in the next video this is the view off my balcony that is South Jersey so that's South Jersey a look so so she must have been so New York here South Jersey so South Jersey she must have been out here right so she's looking pointing South Jersey and then to the left she looked at New York she seemed closer to New York either way New York was on the left New Jersey she pointed to on the right yeah so straight out there over the ocean was this weird light going on that is Jersey City okay Jersey City over here is New York City okay right along the river there right so this is this is what she this is where this is it she's got to be along here somewhere so she's looking right out now there is something here was there fireworks going on was there something cuz she is looking that way maybe I'm not too sure but definitely something strange what she's seeing like you know if that's her balcony she's seeing that view got a beautiful view by the way right she's seen that view a lot and obviously recorded this because it's not something that she's seen before quite strange Ury Park boardwalk beach cam drones launched from the ocean here we go these drones are coming from the ocean so I think what's happening is as time come goes on more and more evidence shows that these things are coming from the ocean and I know that Congress has spoken about that the Pentagon I think has maybe said that as well or suggested that in fact they're keeping the mouth shut more so but the more that the the people record and collect information the more we're discovering yeah these things are actually coming from the ocean Point Pleasant Beach two [Music] there two there ignore the uh light on the jetty that's two three four five that one above might be an airplane I don't know these are boats I guess there fishing boats coming in they're just kind of sitting there with their lights on and my what they're saying that's two drones there and there's two here this one bright one has been doing that and that's kind of all I see at the moment these boats are maybe hunting for drones too maybe but right there see those guys this is Point Pleasant Beach there's been some air traffic I I just had somebody up here that was was had somebody up here that was uh looking at some weather I not weather uh a flight app there's no airplanes around but man they are out tonight December 12th 2024 P Pleasant Beach I mean it's got way past the point now of people reporting these things in the air right because it's it's such a Hot Topic Talk of the Town no one's reporting these now they're just recording them and putting them up on Tik Tok here's new footage that has uh risen recently UAP drone emerges from the ocean in New Jersey now that I I don't know what this white thing is here is that a rocket launch like what is this bit here as well though right because this see this bit here this is what I saw on the other one here is this the same thing what is that looks like maybe maybe that's like a a ship or something out there now on yesterday's video I spoke a little bit about um what these drones are looking like when people are zooming in on them on a DSLR camera um what we saw was absolutely incredible some sort of interference maybe this is something to do with that frequency that can't be picked up on but this is probably the the clearest image you're going to see of this weird is it is it a force field is it some sort of just a a glitch interference I don't know but it's very clear take a look at this clear footage of drones UAP is captured in New Jersey morphing into plane this is a recent footage this is morphing into a plane e I mean is that is just that is that a like a a glitch because it's out of focus when it's trying to zoom in and the dsli is trying to work out it's just putting it into a big ball but now it's focusing because it's it's getting closer that's the more logical reason right but that you can't deny that is the New Jersy drone but that I mean I've seen blur I've got I've got four dlsr cameras right DS DSLR and I've zoomed in on lights and being out night uh photography and things like that I don't see blurs like this I've got to be honest with you I don't see blurs like this this is um East Brun switch in New Jersey this gentleman watch one of these just disappear this gentleman's recording outside of his car window one of these uaps just disappears right it either moves away extremely quickly or just disappears big part right holy [ __ ] where the hell the other one come from look how bright look how bright and big these things are are [ __ ] UFOs holy [ __ ] these just appearing I zoomed in [Music] on I [ __ ] notice at certain points as well these things go yellow right and we've seen many of these yellow orbs flying around have they always been these drone things can the have these drones got more capabilities than we we think they're hovering around New Jersey right now very slow being up there for two hours at a time okay which is way more than uh that your your your battery can can last especially for something the size of a car and these these yellow orbs have been seen to just dot around vanish maneuver like on a on a dime is that there cloaking like that energy ball that we just saw in the previous video so we can't see them we can't see exactly what they are they're just glowing balls of light I mentioned earlier that these drones are now in lag Guardia Airport okay in New York look at this here they are they moving out they're branching out now I said when I did the video the other day about that um computer software that predicted a major UAP event happening from the third or fourth of December onwards is this what we're seeing they predicted they predicted a a sky well it predicted a sky battle a UAP versus UAP UAP versus man-made planes battle in the sky now look at this now this has been sent to me so many times a a UA P from New Jersey actually firing I don't know what at but it's firing something check this out it does look like a UAP look at this and look how that moves how it shifts what is it firing at why isn't this all over the news watch it just shift in a second it shoots and then just shifts like like that and then movees slowly [ __ ] it's moving so bizarrely holy cow that thing is completely stationary shooting and not only that there's there's videos now of these things leaving some sort of Trail um spraying something right look at this [ __ ] look at him spraying look at that why is is it spraying that he is spraying the sky now if that is a New Jersey UAP or drone and it's spraying that really puts a spanner in the works because that would suggest or what would it suggest I don't know what is it spraying again bro this is [ __ ] crazy man is it spraying or is that a trail look at this guy they're spraying the skies look at all of them and imagine that this guy imagine just showing this to somebody from five years ago less than that saying look what's going to happen in the skies at some point like what you on about mate UFOs don't exist this guy just sprayed that more drones over Manhattan this is great footage look at this look at the state of this this should be world news updated 247 live 247 from major news outlets but the only people that are covering it is you guys recording on your your camera and US YouTubers and ticktockers right social media platforms so people that covering it properly in depth trying to work out the answers they're all over the place orcas can't bring it down they've said because of the frequency is not there they can't they can't be detected apparently when they're approached they go dark and shoot off probably back to the Atlantic underwater again like the footage I've just shown you this is incredible so that that's that few sentences I just told you then screams alien Tech right but the C to that is over the most densely populated state in America they want to be seen if this is alien Tech they want to be seen clearly now listen to this girl she's a um she's a local in New Jersey I live in New Jersey these drones are on top of my house every single night and here's why I really think they're aliens going to insert a video there was about 10 of them on top of my house last night and they are car sized they are huge they really are the size of small cars but two nights ago one of them crashed 15 minutes from so by the time the Drone one of them crashed she says one of them crashed like yeah which I mentioned and I showed you footage of a crash site or Flames I should say but we didn't know any more about it now she's got a photo of this we go back a little bit hey are car sized they are huge they really are the size of small cars but two nights ago one of them crashed 15 minutes from so by the time the Drone crashed until I got there it was about an hour when I got there it wasn't there there was no drone and I have a picture of it when it have a picture of it when it crashed there was no drone and there was like two cop cars where the [ __ ] did did it go who took it within an hour of it crashing like what and of course nobody has answers the FBI doesn't have an answer our governor doesn't have an answer like nobody knows but apparently we're safe and we have nothing to worry about but nobody knows what they are oh I do think they're aliens I do not think they're from Iran I do not think they're from China because when aliens don't mean any harm and they want peace and they're protecting us they're going to morph themselves into something familiar like a drone even though their car size we're still familiar with drones if aliens wanted harm we'd be walking out to Will Smith and freaking Independence Day okay I I agree with that and this is what I'm saying there's a lot of people saying um can you be serious these things with green and red flashing lights and stuff yeah I'm like if we went over to another planet and we wanted to let that planet know of our presence but discreetly softly we wouldn't go in there with our [ __ ] harria jump Jet right we would look at their Tech and go look we need to just go in there softly just say look we're like you we're okay right and try to mimic their crafts in some way I'm not saying that they are absolutely 100% alien beings right alien Tech I'm just saying that's that's common sense but if the government wanted to create a story of an alien attack right let's put it this way if the government said okay we need to we need Project Blue beam going in full force now we need to create some sort of alien attack when we need to scare the public would they make drones that look like human Tech drones with blinking lights no they wouldn't they would they would create some crazy ass shape that does some weird stuff in the sky to freak us out I really do think they're here because they live here too and I'll tell you where they live they're here to stop World War II for us because they live here too this is their home too and in case you didn't know 80% of our oceans are unexplored and this is where they are coming from the aliens live in the ocean call me crazy that's fine but this is really what I believe and all I'm going to be doing is praying and hoping for the best I live in New Jersey okay now um let's go to this individual here I live in North Jersey and I've seen the drones I'm also an environmental science major and I've taken classes that pertain to this I've taken a GIS geographic information systems course and I've also taken a drones course where we learn how to use government style drones we had an opportunity to actually get a government license from the course we learned how to fly the drones around to collect data using liar and this data was Visual and non-visual data and in GIS we would interpret that data think of software like Google Earth I see a lot of people asking why don't we just fly a drone up and then figure out what these things are that's very illegal any person in possession of a drone that's equipped to fly high enough and have a long enough battery life to check out what these things are they need a government license they also need a permit to fly in any airspace like I I I think that's different in the UK as long as you've got the license and you're not flying over um a PO I suppose a heavy populated area yeah um but that's more like a crowd of people like you can't fly over um a concert or a you know a ball game or something like that you can fly over a city um you just need license if it's over a certain weight like mine and somebody went back and forth with me on this mine my DJI Mini 2 I think it is I don't need a license for that because it's under it's like a couple of grams under the certain weight so I don't need I don't need to go for my course and go for a license I could just me fly it um but if that was happening in my town Nuki I know for a fact my mate mace and me would be out there with drones he's he's he's his drone he needs a license for we'd be out there mate we'd be up there checking these things out um so maybe it's different in the United States and the fact that these drones are in restricted airspace is very fishy to me because why wouldn't the government figure out what they are right in my humble opinion whatever they are the government knows what they are already in my opinion they're not disclosing everything for a specific reason do I know what reason it is I it could be a million things bro didn't major in politics but the government holding a meeting in New Jersey that was all theatrics it's so that the public doesn't freak out I think she speaks a lot of facts there I think there is a lot of that I think we are only told what we need to be told which I think in a in some ways for especially the people in New Jersey is a good is good news because if they do know lot more than we do and they're not shooting them down now I don't think that they're a threat I don't think so anyway thank you so much um although we didn't get any answers a lot more has come to surface it's quite clear now that these things are coming from the ocean they're going back to the ocean they don't want to be seen via radar they can interfere with frequencies but they do want to be seen clearly because they are visiting the most densely populated state in the whole of the US they want to be seen why is that is it to let us know that we're safe they're looking after us is this to do with World War II to say we got you back is it human Tech is it testing out tech for surveillance I if I feel like we're getting closer to the answers but in the same breath we're so far away thank you so much for watching I really hope to see you again take care bye-bye"

of transportation according to the creators behind Pegasus their solution is a helicopter equipped with wheels initially you can drive it out of your garage and onto the street just like a regular car but when you see congestion simply switch on the propeller and take to the skies on the ground the Pegasus can reach speeds of 120 kmph and boasts a range of 420 km it can stay airborne for 3 hours and Achieve speeds of up to 160 kmph looking ahead to the 2030s the company aims to manufacture 900 Pegasus units annually what do you think could they actually pull it off [Music] [Applause] in 2023 a whopping 13.6 million electric cars were sold all over the world marking a nearly oneir increase from the previous year this growth seems promising but many urban areas are struggling to adapt to the rapid influx of electric vehicles for instance authorities are grappling with how to install enough charging stations to meet demand as they Ponder this challenge a solution called go sun has emerged this solar power charging device has proven so popular that it raked in over $2 million in just the first 45 days of pre-orders who would say no to an extra 48 km of driving range per day plus the ghost sun is easy to install on your car's roof and can be deployed for use in just a minute [Music] photo kite Sigma drones are literally attached to a specific location with the tether they take off from their cases while dragging a power cable behind them they can climb up to 45 M and stay in the air for up to 24 hours this allows Rescuers firefighters police and other professionals to see

hybrid Zoom helps you see even the smallest details the T1000 from Terminator 2 was unafraid of damage because it was made of liquid metal when the movie came out in 1991 this seemed incredibly cool however now there are even more impressive Technologies available researchers at CID have created a polymer that behaves similarly if you cut it and then reattach the pieces they'll fuse Back Together by about 97% in Just 2 hours this creates a single strong and flexible material once again you don't need any special conditions the polymer can fuse together at room temperature this material similar to gummy candy is useful for the automotive construction and other Industries and it's only a matter of time before someone creates a T1000 like robot with it [Music] the teleporters from different fantasy books and science fiction movies are a fast way to travel from one location to another although we are still far from having magic Scrolls or devices like Stargate vario has developed a useful alternative instead of transporting people and objects Mario's teleport system moves locations from The Real World to the virtual one here's how it works to use vario teleport you need a smartphone with a special app that scans a room Street or any other space the app then reconstructs the scanned area and turns it into a virtual location that you can explore using a VR headset or a web browser on any Windows or Mac device if you're interested in trying out vario teleport you'll need an iPhone 12 Pro or newer and must sign up for Early Access by filling out the form on the company's [Music]

greens but also cabbage and [Music] berries the next time you're stuck in traffic take a look around you'll probably notice that most cars have only one or two people in them did you know that just one bus can replace 155 cars however owning a personal car is often seen as a symbol of success it's like saying I make enough money to avoid public transportation but what if taking the bus became just as prestigious and even had the logos of luxury Brands like Audi or BMW designer Marco petravic explored this idea in the moving on challenge with the help of the Yano design team he created a six-seater electric capsule that runs on solar panels and follows a set route like a regular bus but how does this relate to top brands if Audi were to produce such capsules they'd likely gain even more popularity and secure additional contracts for Mass deliveries to cities around the world [Music] we're taking a look at simsoft the company that created a train driver simulator where something that looks like a giant microwave oven crashed into a realistic train cabin the simulator features virtual roots that are similar to games like train Sim World 3 but with added physical levers buttons and other attributes of a model train cabin the simulator can be configured for urban and Inter City railroads street cars and Subway the conditions on the route also change with weather conditions

movable section downward pressure builds up inside the boy once the pressure is strong enough it pushes the section back up and the cycle repeats during this process linear motion is converted into rotation and then into electricity during testing the station produced an average power of 10 KW and a peak power of around 80 KW the manufacturers plan to create units capable of generating 500 KW in the future the Archimedes wave swing Works effectively at depths of 25 M or more and it takes approximately 12 hours to prepare for operation after leaving the [Music] harbor the Brooker h90 is a highly specialized and practical tool for conducting remote hyperspectral analysis specifically it's designed to detect potentially dangerous Gases such as those emitted by non-compliant factories or during terrorist attacks the system can function effectively even from several kilometers away it's capable of pinpointing the origin size and chemical makeup of hazardous plumes Additionally the Brooker h90 comes equipped with a built-in camera that overlays hyperspectral data directly onto video footage this system is great at monitoring gases liquid droplets and particul matter all while operating at 16 scans per second [Music] researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong have created some helpful and amusing robots they took inspiration from snails specifically their ability to move and stop in any position but what is the purpose of this after all these robots are quite slow however don't speed up the video just yet take a look at how well they work together with a combination of a suction cup and two magnets tracks these high tech snails can attach to each other and build various structures for example they can create a bridge for larger robots to Cross or even make a robotic arm these capabilities could be useful for rescue teams let's wish the team the best of L did you know that IBM has already started a new era in Quantum Computing in 2023 they introduced the world's first modular quantum computer and its processor compared to the previous models IBM's Engineers have made significant improvements the new technology produces five times fewer errors and can handle the most complex math chemistry and physics problems while regular computers that take tens of thousands of years to solve these problems quantum computers can do it in minutes additionally IBM says that their new system Quantum system 2 and the Heron processor come with the advanced software kit 1.0 this software speeds up certain tasks by about five times when riding a motorcycle in the rain bikers have to manually wipe their vises which is inconvenient and distracting so why not create a small wiper for them similar to the ones found in cars that's exactly what the makers of biker guard did the cost of this wiper is $345 which may seem high but it's because the brushless motor used in it is very reliable and costs more than the Clon of biker guard available on AliExpress the quality of the wiper has been tested by the ailia racing team who were impressed by it Additionally the wiper design is waterproof and a full charge lasts for 15 hours the manufacturers are confident that this is the first truly functional product of its kind and offer a 3-year warranty [Music] artificial floating islands are often discussed as a way to clean and preserve the beauty

help you get from one place to a distant place without breaking a sweat pieces of plastic and metal put together the right way can make you communicate with someone who's miles away from you and most importantly information and data can now be stored and retrieved later on and the world is in need of people who understand how this information and Technology works so what exactly is information technology first and foremost it must be understood that this is a very broad topic but information technology is the use of computer systems storages networks and tangible devices technological infrastructure systems and processes to create modify transfer store multiply and exchange all forms of electronic data so what exactly is data data is every type of information from Facts statistics numerical sequences and patterns which is analyzed studied compared modified stored and overall used as a component and the overall information that the technology user needs the value of Information Technology is that although people are capable of handling data using our brains and even the old paper and Pen processes these processes are not as reliable efficient and effective as relying on Information Technology a computer can process millions of pieces of data at a given time its storage or memory can hold and secure information without forgetting a single piece of data so where is information technology applicable from the general information above Information Technology plays a significant role in business some examples of this would be customer handling all the way from handling customer service personal day-to-day communication storing Financial records and all other human activities that deal with handling electronic data information technology is essential to the day-to-day operations of a business and even more important when it comes to scaling your business to make more money and this is why learning the skills of Information Technology is incredibly valuable whether you want to get a job or start your own business next let's talk about Hardware versus software before we can discuss examples of Information Technology it's important that we talk about hardware and software Hardware is tangible technology that you can actually touch when it comes to dealing with information technology from personal computers laptops mobile phones tablets and everything else that is physical and is used for the purposes of It software on the other hand is intangible AKA You can't touch it so this would be things such as websites computer programs or systems and applications and it's going to be broadly separated into two different groups which is software systems and applications software systems are basic programs that are tasked to perform computer functions at its most basic level an example of this would be an operating system for a phone such as iOS or Android applications on the other hand also have a lot of examples such as databases email servers transaction processing systems process control systems Enterprise collaboration systems and many more some examples of this would be slack Dropbox HubSpot Google Drive and Microsoft Office next let's talk about Information Technology as a rear path information technology is very broad but it is a great career path if you are able to learn the skills of Information Technology with the constant rise of technology in this modernized world it is safe to say that you will almost definitely have a job according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations is ninety seven thousand dollars that's over twice the median annual wage for all other applications which is forty five thousand and according to glassdoor.com an entry-level position as an IT Help Desk technician makes over fifty thousand dollars a year so not only does Information Technology offer you a good salary but being nit keeps you updated with the latest in Technology Innovation a few examples of fields related to Information Technology are it management computer systems analyst web development cyber security Cloud Administration and database Administration if you want to learn a way to get into information technology in a few months click the free training which I will put down in the description encryption as

you get to be in this lovely warm cozy Apple ecosystem right as soon as you've got your iPhone then you're going to get yourself a pair of airpods maybe an Apple Watch uh maybe you know airpods Maxes you might then think I need a bigger screen get yourself a iPad with a apple pencil uh or even you know a Macbook this is my MacBook Pro here and if you've got very Deep Pockets maybe even an apple Vision Pro although probably not there's some fantastic hardware and equally fantastic software that ties it all together with airdrop and iMessage and FaceTime and using your iPad as a second screen you can use your watch as a camera preview Apple Health making you feel guilty for not closing your rings and newer stuff like iPhone mirroring to your Mac and apple intelligence and also fundamentally the benefits that come with apple owning everything the hardware the software the App Store that vertical integration that makes everything just simple and seamless and safe we're not dealing with Android and Windows here the Apple ecosystem is fantastic but can you get the same experience or maybe even a better experience with Team Samsung I mean straight away you've got a huge range of phones from the more regular S4s you've got the s24 Ultras you've got the folds and the flips arguably the best foldy flippy phones you can buy right now you've got your Galaxy buds Pro 3 you've got your Galaxy Rings your Galaxy Tabs with SP pens and of course your Galaxy books this is the new Galaxy book 4 edge with a Snapdragon X Series ship all this stuff and so much more from TVs to home appliances and crucially they match pretty much every single one of Apple's features with Quick Share and foam mirroring multicontrol second screens Samsung Health Smart things and of course we've got Galaxy AI now to be fair most of the tech Brands the big ones these days have their own kind of ecosystem uh Huawei in particular you've got xiaomi and honor and OnePlus but I would argue these guys are the big ones the best in terms of having a fully-fledged ecosystem but which one is better well I'm going to break this video down into eight different categories award a point to one of the two and then hopefully by the end we'll see and of course being an apple versus Samsung video I'm sure I'm going to get a few comments saying how incredibly wrong I am and that's absolutely fine do let me know which one you think is the best ecosystem in the comments below and also if there is actually anything that would make you jump ship between them and finally a big thank you to Apple for sponsoring this video can you imagine if I did that that'd be ridiculous no sponsorships here completely my opinion let's get into it number one let's talk about phones this is an iPhone 15 Pro Max uh although we are due with the 16 series late September so getting to the end of its life here and then also we have the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra right now these are the flagship Rivals we're probably going to get s25 in January or show the release Windows a little bit different between these two both exceptional phones You could argue the case which is better all day long but that is it from Apple whereas team Samsung we also have the Galaxy F old six and also the flip 6 we don't have anything like this on team Apple simply put Samsung just has a much greater range of options with the Zed the S the m and the a series which actually if you rearrange those letters it doesn't actually spell anything that would have been fun but given the cheapest iPhone is the SE from 2 years ago at about 430 quid I would definitely take a Galaxy a55 over that especially as he gets 120 HZ screen something that even the iPhone 15 which costs twice as much still doesn't get now this won't be controversial at all but between the s24 ultra and the 15 Pro Max I tend to carry the iPhone with me every day the main reason for that is video stabilization being able to shoot in prores log and also the Cinematic mode and also with the new file cut camera the iPhone for me is just as much a work device as it is like my personal phone having said that I do still bring the s24 ultra with me most time as well I've got two pockets why not have two phones um but one of the most underrated features of the Samsung is this anti reflective screen if I find my uh Studio light I absolutely love that it's so much less reflective it's similarly bright much easier to use Outdoors the Samsung has an extra camera lens it's still the long range Zoom king and you just have a whole bunch more camera options with 8K video directors view you've got expert raw even just the basic stuff like being able to pause the recording and switch the cameras from the front to back and vice versa while recording I miss all this on the iPhone and you've got Samsung deck you can have you know two apps side by side which bizarrely you still car even on the iPhone Pro max they're both fantastic phones and really it's going to come down to do you want iOS or Android between the flagships I'm going to call a tie but just because of the sheer range of options you've got with Samsung from the you know budget end all the way to folds and flips I'm going to give it to The Blue Team Samsung get a point number two headphones earphones these are the Galaxy buds 3 Pro this is the airpods pro second gen about the same price as like a tener between them 230 quid 220 near enough the same these are the pro level phones they were also non-pro versions so a little bit more affordable very very similar and I'm not an audio file I will hold my hands up to that so I'm not going to tell you which one sounds better they're both very very good active noise cancellation uh similar battery lives the only problem with these new buds 3 Pro is that Samsung recalled them at launch apparently these ear tip things were tearing too easily so theyve actually paused the launch of these it will probably be fixed by the time you watch this um so it's not going to trouble anyone who's actually bought one but it was initially a bit of launch issue there however Apple do have an over a option these are the airpods max but they're also a couple of years old now and they're still £500 and I probably wouldn't recommend them I mean they've got a lining port with du a refresh version soon there is so much great overr competition now so little bit hard to recommend these but still an option that we just don't have with Team Samsung at least not yet so realistically whichever phone you pick will likely be the deciding factor over which earphones you buy but these are very evenly matched but I suppose with some of the quality control issues with this and the fact that we have an ere option even if it is a bit old there's not much in it but I'm going to give the point there to Apple number three let's talk about wearables and it's quite funny because throughout we see these Brands kind of copying each other a little bit often apple is slower with features and then they roll something out and say oh look now you've got iPhone mirroring or now you've got customizable home screens it's the best thing ever but we've had on Android for a million years but then on the flip side sometimes Samsung takes design cues uh from Apple or you know new formats of hardware and they kind of do their own thing but this just takes the biscuit Apple makes a watch Ultra Samsung makes literally a watch Ultra even matching the 3,000 L of brightness we get the same red night mode and this is hilarious Apple has The Ocean band for the watch Samsung has their Marine band it's like that Meme of can I copy your homework but just change it up a bit but then in the end who cares imitation just the highest form of flattery and it means we get great rugged options with mulp Day Battery lives from both Brands and that's alongside cheaper regular watches with different sizes different band options all with fantastic Fitness tracking there's not much between them there and so despite some clear homework copying going on wearables go beyond just a watch because Samsung has just launched this guy this is the Galaxy ring in this very smart little charging case I like this a lot and this is going to go up against your aura rings and your Ultra humans you can see here next to my wedding ring it's a little bit chunkier but this is a 400 smart ring it's titanium I've got the black one here it's got a ton of sensors built in the main use case for me is sleep tracking because I find it bit uncomfortable wearing a smartwatch to bed I also like to charge it overnight so that's useful and also if you do pair it with a Galaxy watch it'll actually use the best sensors between them and give you more accurate readings and also extend the battery life of both devices it is an independent accessory uh but it is improved if you use a Galaxy watch and also you can use this with other Android phones but you will get the most features if you pair it with a Galaxy phone but it's a Nifty bit of Kit I'm excited to use this a bit more and it's something that Apple just doesn't offer however what we do have from Team apple is a headset the um Apple Vision Pro which has now launched in a lot more countries it's not just us only I've got that a bit mixed up there but it is still3 and a halfish th000 just that now I've had this on my desk for well since it launched I actually imported one myself I bought this from the US when it launched and the first two weeks absolutely magical you can watch my full review on it really really cool bit of tech I don't think there is a device in the last few years that have given me so many holy moments like proper wow Tech but since then after say the first two or 3 weeks I don't think I've used it once I know I took it to a friend's house because I'm one of those people to show it off cuz they really wanted to try it but beyond that it's just s my desk and it's a very impressive technically bit of Kit and and the vision os2 software is coming with some improved gestures we get better Mac support with ultra wide display modes which I'm very excited about the travel Mode's been improved as well particularly for trains so they have addressed a bunch of the criticisms I had in my review but I still just don't want to wear it there's no point in my day whether I'm relaxing in the evening or I'm working during the day where I think you know what I want to go into my own little VR AR whatever you want to call it spatial world look at some videos by myself although you can share play now actually but then you know 10 15 30 minutes later come out and go without fail I will get a bit sweaty it'll ruin your hair it's a cool idea but it's too expensive and it just doesn't have that one killer use case that I can't do you know to some extent on other things so very much like the Galaxy ring it's a nice to have it's a cool bit of tech but probably not something I'd recommend so in terms of the wearables I think it's a Ty of SmartWatches Samsung's got the Galaxy Ring Apple's got the Vision Pro I'm going to be really annoying and call this a tie number four tablets this is the latest 2024 iPad Pro 11 in and this if I don't drop it this is the latest still Samsung Galaxy type S9 Ultra both absolutely stunning Flagship tablets you get keyboards and styluses with both in fact you get it bundled with the Galaxy Tab separate uh pencil pencil Pro with the iPad both Brands offer great budget mid-range and high-end options however Samsung does offer a super duper cheap a series so again as slightly bigger range of options from Samsung so what do I like about the Galaxy Tabs well firstly the aspect ratio is obviously much wider than an iPad so for watching videos and movies you'll get less letter boxing also if you want to use it vertically that's more mimicking the aspect ratio of a phone for social apps for scrolling through websites also this tab S9 Ultra is 14.6 in the biggest iPad's 13 in it's nuts if anything is actually a bit too big and importantly all tab S9 even the cheapest one for 350 quid have an Spen bundle in the box and have at least a 990 HZ refresh rate you literally have to buy a 1,000 iPad Pro to get a higher than 60 HZ refresh you've also got the book cover keyboard to turn it more into a laptop and of course we've got Samsung's Dex mode which gives you a full desktop and since it runs Android you do have a lot more flexibility for installing third party apps and stores versus the closed App Store you get on the iPad the only downsides are that this is actually a little bit old now it came out mid 2023 so we actually haven't had a 2024 refresh yet the rumors are that we'll see one probably in October is and also while for some people they will want an Android tablet I suspect most people probably won't genuinely because apps just aren't as well optimized for these bigger screens for Android tablets uh with a Google Play Store versus iPad apps on the Apple App Store so in favor of the iPad we have iPad OS we have the Apple App Store which is just generally a smoother better optimized experience for a tablet with apple arcade with specific Apple exclusive apps like procreate and Final Cut also while the apple pencil is bought separately I would argue that the pencil Pro with the magic keyboard while expensive are the best you can get for a tablet I also really appreciate Apple has discontinued the older 9th gen iPad with the chunky bowel and the home button but instead they've dropped the price and made the 10th gen the new default cheap option and for most people that is all you need although I do really like the new 13-in Air because you get a big screen iPad for 500 quid less than the same siiz Pro and so between these two specifically the iPad gets brighter we've got a more powerful chip again it's going to come down to do you want iOS or Android for me though I'm going to give the point to Apple when it comes to tablets but what about these laptops PCS well I can tell you that for the longest time I used a Samsung Galaxy S whatever and a d XPS laptop for like five or six years I just use those constantly because a great combination but then Apple came out with the M1 chip which actually made me switch to the MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 ditching my XPS and then because I used this I thought well it' be nice to have an iPhone as well so I could use airdrop got myself an iPhone I thought well it' be good to have an air you know airpods and then a watch so it was actually the laptop that first got me into the Apple ecosystem and obviously this is just my opinion but even with their flaws I still think MacBook A's MacBook Pros are the best allaround the laptops unless you want to play some proper games but things are getting a little bit more interesting on the Windows side this is the Samsung Galaxy book for Edge and I mentioned earlier that this is actually one of the first wave of laptops to come with a different kind of chip this is the Snapdragon X Elite so it's an Arm based chip rather than traditional x86 that you get from Intel and AMD and so for the first time we're seeing MacBook level MacBook quality of laptop on a Windows device in terms of the performance also the performance on battery it doesn't suffer much at all being away from the charger the battery life how cool and quiet it runs these are fantastic laptops now there is a bit of a caveat because with this new architecture like we saw with the Apple transition although that was pretty seamless there are some app compatibility issues not all apps will run the vast majority will but not all of them they're not all as well optimized but this is just one of I think six different models of galaxy book 4 with regular book fours the pro the 360 the pro 360 The Edge and the ultra and only this Edge has the Snapdragon chip all others have a traditional Intel Core Ultra chip with the ultra offering a dedicated RTX 470 graphics card there's Chromebooks there's a 360 Flip option there are touch screens and there are also a lot of advantages to Windows especially for Enterprise and Gamers so some really bloody good laptops from Samsung but on the other hand apple offers the iMac allinone and also the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro desktop although all three are due an M4 upgrade hopefully later this year and there's also a reason the mbook airs the mbook pros like I have here are so popular because there isn't a better combination of design power performance battery life web webcam quality the Fantastic keyboard and touchpad and you know just the simple ease of use of Mac OS the downsides are that you have fewer options to choose from also it's not as well optimized for games by any stretch that's definitely Windows territory also the cheapest MacBook realistically is like a ,000 Macbook here so really it's going to come down to whether you prefer Windows or Mac OS so I'm going to call it frustratingly a tie even though I tend to use this myself so I've got a lot of devices on the table here but what about the more extended family because we're talking about the EOS system and it does go beyond what I've got on the desk here I mean Apple has the desktop Macs they've got Apple TV homepod The Vision Pro of course plus you've got air tags and some extra services but Samsung well Samsung just make everything TVs projectors washing machines fridges vacuum cleaners air conditioners monitors they've got their own smart tags as well they make everything and the kitchen SN most of which is tied together through their smart things app kind of like Apple's hom kit except for a billion different products does the fact that you can buy a Samsung TV fundamentally change your experience using one of their phones or their headphones or their laptops no not really but this video is all about the ecosystem and unquestionably Samsung has the biggest extended family it's all broadly connected I think that deserves a point however while we've got all this lovely Hardware equally important the thing that actually you know connects it all together and mix an ecosystem and not just a lot of products that have the same logo is the software the features now this could be like an hourong video by itself so I'm going to keep it brief let's see if Samsung can keep up with what we get on Apple One airdrop well on this we have Quick Share which actually recently merged with Google's nearby share um and is basically the same thing and actually it works with a whole lot more devices outside of just the Galaxy ecosystem other Android phones other Windows laptops uh iMessage well there isn't a direct equivalent Macs do now support RCS messaging with the latest software we still have blue and green bubbles and all that nonsense but Samsung doesn't really have an iMessage equivalent nor does it have a FaceTime equivalent like a first party video calling app you can actually send a link from an iPhone or you know an Apple device to an Android user and they can join your FaceTime but it doesn't go both ways you can't use share play which you can if you keep it within the Apple ecosystem and of course you could just use zoom or meets or teams or whatever you want to use but there isn't like a direct equivalent to FaceTime but then we have Apple's universal control which includes sidecar using your iPad as a second screen and also peripherals like your mouse and keyboard across multiple devices and even be able to copy text from one device and paste it on another I use this all the time you've got continuity camera to use your iPhone as your max webcam and with the latest IOS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia we now have iPhone mirroring can your Samsung do all that well the short answer is yeah actually mostly it can broadly their equivalent to universal control is Samsung flow with a few specific apps including multicontrol which lets you control multiple Galaxy devices I can rearrange them based on my setup and then use the laptop's trackpad and keyboard across all three I can also transfer files this way anything I copy gets added to the clipboard and I can paste it to any of the devices Samsung's second screen feature also lets you use your tablet as an external display for your Galaxy book both Apple and Samsung let you use your phone's camera as a webcam and they both have phone mirroring feature-wise it is very similar and you've also got you know homeit smart things uh Apple Health Samsung Health you've got notes Samsung Notes photos Samsung gallery and even the file Cod camera app versus is expert rule on Samsung there's like a one for one for pretty much everything however Samsung does offer decks and although I can't say I use it that much I know some people swear by it so feature wise very very similar between them what I would say from my own experience though is that it's all a bit easier a bit more seamless a bit more responsive particularly using SC car with your iPad or the continuity camera or iPhone mirroring it's all a bit faster and nicer to use with the Apple products that's been my experience and while it's not something I'm particularly bothered about I know a lot of people do want IM message and FaceTime and so for those Reasons I'm going to give the point to Apple I can't believe we're this far through the video basically at the end I've not even mentioned the word AI yet or maybe I have anyway it's a tricky one because right now Apple intelligence isn't really here yet uh you can get it in the beta software it's coming to the US with I think iOS 18.1 it's been a little bit delayed later in the year but us only us English for now so it's going to be a bit of a slower roll out and quite frankly Apple has fallen behind series useless currently will be a lot better with apple intelligence but they playing catop and actually I reckon Samsung is way out ahead here but they also have one big advantage that it's not just tied to one ecosystem we've got Google's Gemini on Android we've got copilot on Windows but we do also have a whole bunch of Samsung's own in-house Galaxy AI features with all these translation and transcription assistance you've got interpreter modes so even taking advantage of the second screen on the flip and the fold you've got image generation tools like sketch the image which is kind of like co-creator on Windows and we're getting something similar on Apple intelligence 3D moving photos like your mom does on Facebook you've got Circle to search you've got AI generated wallpapers and probably more importantly some very impressive photo editing tools in the gallery app you can do a lot of this in say the Google photos app on your iPhone as well but right now in terms of AI I'm going to give the point to Samsung eight categories down let's tally the points and we're looking at three for Apple three for Samsung and two ties think okay it's a draw of course it is it very much depends on what you are used to what you prefer and also what you can afford because while Samsung offers some fantastic high-end Hardware across the board they also give you more affordable options it's a much higher more expensive barrier to entry for this stuff the good news though is that both have exceptional ecosystems I would say apples tends to be a little bit more seamless but then Samsung gives you a greater range of products Apple Hardware tends to hold its value for longer but then you can often find better deals on Samsung Hardware as they go on sale but as the saying goes if you sit on the fence and you'll get splinters in your ass but I am fortunate enough to have access to all of this Tech I can pick and choose what I want to use and right now I am leaning more towards the Apple side of things predominantly for the MacBook but I also love the iPhone we've got a new one coming in late September but that's me what about you which would you go for wish do you think the ecosystem let me know in the comments below and also let me know if there is anything that would make you jump ship between C these a like And subscribe will be fantastic and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat"

this certification they can confidently apply for State tenders and trade into nationally it's no surprise that their balconies while seeming ordinary feature several impressive Technologies for instance Lee uses an aluminium alloy that's 20% stronger than others paired with alue Comfort powder coating these balconies can withstand hail think the glass won't hold up to the elements it's special too having endured the impact of a 50 kg Pendulum In tests one secret to their durability is multi-layering a film is placed between two pieces of glass plus the advanced Alo Comfort plus painting technology makes the balcony look like wood such as [Music] Oak xcl is a handy system that lets you insulate a building and add brick cladding at the same time first workers in install extruded poyene boards which range in thickness from 17 to 100 mm next they attach narrow brick cladding using adesive and add mortar for strength and to mimic real brick [Music] work the final result is just 33 mm thick and weighs from 36 kg per square meter it's a great option for upgrading wooden buildings too plus it's eco-friendly as making this cladding requires 60 to 70% less energy than traditional [Music] bricks AFS logic wall is a permanent formwork that combines several interesting features first the panels can be customized reducing prep work on the construction site second the production process is finally tuned just 8 days pass from the moment the drawings are approved to the delivery of the finished formwork third the panels can be installed manually saving sites where cranes can't be used it's also worth noting the wide range of sizes the width reaches 1.1 M and the height is 4.2 m need more the manufacturer is open to discussing larger options plus AFS logic wall is a great durable base for finishing [Music] materials Geo plus modulo formwork turned out to be so so great that it was used during the Reconstruction of the VIP Zone at the famous Roland garos Stadium even smaller projects have been successful with it here's a video from Romania where workers are building a ventilated [Music] Foundation using 4800 formwork blocks they covered an area of 12200 square m in just 8 Days overall geoplast modulo is a great choice for spaces that use r on and need ventilation and if speed is important the manufacturer suggest adding fast leg blocks that allow pouring in one step from a height of over 50 [Music] cm Arrow lift lifts houses yes just like that each Tower of this amazing system can support up to 20 tons now Builders can repair foundations install footings or dig excavations without any obstacles the maximum lifting height is 5.2 M leaving plenty of room for Machinery like excavators if the house is too heavy for Four Towers just add more to increase the load capacity [Music] more height that can be discussed too and if workers haven't used something like this before the manufacturer offers training this is the future both machines and houses are reaching New [Music] Heights we're in Takahashi a small Japanese City with less than 30,000 people that's been affected by landslides in the past to protect itself against them the city decided to build reinforcing structures one of the most interesting Parts is when a worker secured by a cable like a rock climber sprays concrete but it's not enough to just create something that looks like a giant Tic Tac toeboard the structure needs to be secured with humans sized anchors for this the Japanese used an ESD 210 machine which can adjust its angle from - 10 to 90° the effort paid off the slope is now much stronger take that [Music] Landslide Eed raised floorings are strong enough for 20 mm thick porcelain Stone wear and they let you hide cables pipes and other stuff putting them in is quick and simple as you can lay the tiles in different patterns and if the customer wants wood they'll be happy to know that even a 244 cm long board won't move and the surface stays [Music] stable also Eck floors don't need special care in Winter and work well by the pool [Music] [Music] this pit doesn't stand a chance a worker arrives with two bags the first contains 14 to 20 mm of bitamin coated chippings known as agrill it fills potholes up to 6 cm deep and is commonly used alongside with chipfill worms made of thermoplastic [Music] when heated with a burner they form a strong top layer that cars can drive on in just 20 minutes the road is ready for use again chip fill can also be used on its own for smaller pits besides a burner the worker needs a brush and gloves [Music] Rhino products are excellent for structural strengthening and crack repair in concrete as a leading company they've created a system that's easy to install but highly effective in creating super strong joints the main part is a rebar like lock made of carbon fiber which doesn't corrode and is 10 times stronger than steel one lock has a tensile strength of 1,315 kg Rhino uses epoxy resin to fill the joints making it easy to paint over them later this repair method works well for Mason rate swimming pools industrial buildings and more especially when the deflection is less than 5 cm [Music] when it comes to spray Coatings Titan applicators is the company to trust like Rhino it's a leader in its field among other things it has developed a replacement for EPDM roofing membranes using foam this is a great option because at a thickness of Just 2 and 1/2 CM the heat transfer resistance reaches seven for comparison an insulated brick wall has a rating of about 2.5 plus the foam doesn't shrink it prevents mold and fungus growth and keeps insects out it also reduces drafts and noise making it suitable for both residential and Commercial properties [Music] ponds tunnels landfills Bento fix mats are used in many different projects and offer top-notch insulation against water gases and Vapors this is all thanks to their multi-layer structure each map combines several layers of geotextile with bentonite powder dried and finally ground clay in between this sandwich is needle punch to hold together the improved Shear strength comes from thermal lock technology in the video Builders use benter fix in a British project to turn a landfill into a park they're also reinforcing a German dam making use of the fact that the mats are easy to work with even underwater [Music] the paon system is made to store storm water while it may not be as impressive as the famous ancient Greek Temple its dimensions are astonishing in normal conditions A pathon system can hold up to 8 million lers even at this scale Builders can complete the installation in a day in the morning the components arrive and by evening the finished system is already covered with Earth its durability is also notable if pathon is placed under a road even four axle trucks can safely drive over it plus customers can add extras like filters and flushing pip work to the system and workers will surely enjoy having built the pathon on their resumés [Music] Cobra is essential for complex drywall ceiling projects these patented flexible profiles are considered Innovative and even revolutionary by their creators they're so easy to use that a single person can handle them just manually shape the profile to the desired curve and Cobra will remember it eliminating the need for extra fixing tools or inserts now making arches domes and similar elements will be easier than ever each profile is 3 m long there are five width options from 3 to 10 cm Cobra's safety margin is ensured by its 0.6 mm thick galvanized steel Construction [Music] next it's time for pip playing Specialists to start working their job involves many steps each needing careful assembly neatness and precise calculations they control the position of the details prepare and compacts the base and install waterproofing it's a lot of work especially with heavy steel or concrete parts that weigh as much as a car but pipelines are crucial for infrastructure and need extra attention for instance the Aging water system system in the US has 240,000 leaks yearly if CTS aren't maintained properly railroads and highways can be [Music] affected low San acoustic panels help lower the noise in a room by 50% while the video shows the tools you need to install these panels let's see some of their features a standard panel measures 240x 60x 2 cm and is made of a non-woven fabric composed of polyester MDF and veneer such as oak or Birch to maintain the quality sellers suggest regularly treating the purchase with oil it's worth noting that these panels can be easily cut on the construction s making switches and sockets less of a hassle for installation it's recommended to use Flathead screws with 15 needed per [Music] [Music] panel when a construction project is over there's always a significant amount of waste left adding to the planet's waste problem in Russia alone we're talking about hundreds of millions of tons of construction waste annually some experts believe that modern construction processes are among the most polluting human activities to address this teams worldwide are exploring ways to make a change let's look at a project developed by students from the Zurich University of applied sciences their idea is to print formwork on a 3D printer using Earth in instead of traditional concrete they use cement-free [Music] compounds Pebble lock is a great way to refresh a worn out driveway parking lot or parking area the 24 mm High mats secure Pebbles crushed stone Granite chips and other loose material aterial this eliminates the need for asphalt paving or concrete and if you prefer you can even avoid hiring workers as installing Pebble lock is easy enough to do it yourself the resulting surface allows water to drain through preventing puddles for Pebbles the recommended size is 8 to 14 mm it looks neat attractive and is eco-friendly as the mats are made from recycled plastic [Music] the list of benefits of prefabricated monolithic slabs from the company Domo vadets is quite long they weigh half as much as a solid slab and cost almost a third less they don't need a scre and are great for sites where heavy machinery can't reach Plus they allow you to hide utility lines in their voids there are just four parts to the slab system a loadbearing reinforced concrete or metal beam a block insert made of air rated concrete expanded clay blocks or EPS concrete which actess formwork a reinforcing mesh and structural concrete besides these advantages this combination offers better thermal insulation which is useful if the building has lots of bay wind window and other architectural features and the installation is fast no more than 1 human hour per square meter from the Exxon Mobile Refinery to the US capital lift Bots have an impressive track record it's no surprise as one of these lifting robots can be installed in under half an hour and lift loads at a speed of 42 m per minute allowing construction workers to EAS easy lift up to 6 tons in an 8 hour shift the standard lifting height is 50 m with the option to increase it if needed lift bot runs on electricity it works 10 hours on a full battery and recharges from a standard 110 or 220 volt Outlet this makes construction s safer and saves up to 44% on labor costs moreover this lifting robot can be installed on [Music] scaffolding bullfrog track 2 is a simple but useful tool for construction workers to level concrete a cable is stretched between the edges of the port area and the bullfrog track 2 moves back and forth creating smooth strips 1.2 to 3 m wide it's battery powered and a full charge covers 1,115 s m when the battery is almost empty an indicator light flashes and an alarm sounds the kit includes 2 30 m cables so no need to search for a rope to operate the bullfrog track two you'll need a team of Two And it costs about $3500 [Music]"

So I thought before Diwali, if you haven't bought anything yet, I'll give you some good deals. I've brought 4 good smartphone deals but this is a little different. Because I didn't just want to talk about smartphones, I wanted to talk about their hearts & brains too. We always say in our videos that the processor is very important & there's a reason. It's not just because of the AnTuTu score, when we unbox it, we tell you about the AnTuTu score. So that you come to know about the performance & there's a benchmark. This processor is actually a system on chip. It's a complete system. Meaning how your camera will function, how your connectivity is going to be, how your DSP, ISP, image signal processing, digital signal processing is going to be. All these things are dependent on SoC. And obviously, Snapdragon processors are always ahead. And generally, when I talk to consumers, one thing that comes to mind is that people prefer Snapdragon processors. And there's a reason, the Snapdragon processors are generally good when it comes to CPU, GPU & other things. Even connectivity, modem, even power efficiency. And all the phones I'm going to tell you about are on Snapdragon processors. But this 1st deal, OMG! I mean, seriously, I've said this before & I'm still saying it. And in deals, it's such a value for money phone. I'm talking about POCO F6. Yes, 8S Gen 3 comes on this processor. It's the latest generation processor with AnTuTu score of 1.5M. No matter how much you say, AnTuTu score gives you a benchmark & tells you how powerful it is. And this is one of the most powerful smartphones out there. Meaning you'll be able to play games on the highest settings. And why am I saying it's so good? It's not only a processor, but it's the latest RAM type. It has LPDDR5X RAM type & UFS 4.0 storage type. It has AI features like AI Eraser Pro, AI Image Expansion, AI Gesture Controls. There are many such features. And remember, FPS is very important in gaming. The higher the FPS, the better. And this phone supports Super Resolution. It also upscales the graphics & frame quality while gaming. So it's ideal for gaming. And the camera is 50MP plus 8MP. You get a functional 8MP Ultra Wide & 20MP selfie camera. And because of the Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 processor, the ISP is very powerful. Which gives you really good pictures. So that's about the phone, let's talk about the deal. If I talk about the deal prices of POCO F6, I'm showing it on the screen. I don't know if you can see it on the screen, but I'm giving an updated price. And it's available on Flipkart. By the way, Flipkart & Amazon are not the same, I'm going to tell you the deals on both the platforms. POCO F6 with 8S Gen 3 is a steal! Let's talk about the next Motorola phone, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion. If you want a slim & light lifestyle phone, then you can definitely look at it. It also has 7S Gen 2 with 6.10L & 6.20L AnTuTu scores. You get 68W charging & a 5nm battery, even though it's this thin & light. Battery life & battery backup is also good. And if I talk about the cameras, then Edge 50 Fusion's cameras are very improved. Especially if you look at this generation of Motorola phones, they're really improved. It has a primary sensor, a 700C Sony light sensor, 13MP Ultra Wide & 32MP selfie. And yes, remember, the 4-6nm fabrication process, I'm showing you on the screen. How power efficient the phones are. The less, the more power efficient. And if I talk about the camera output, Edge 50 Fusion's colours are natural & the details are good. I'm showing you samples on the screen, but let's talk about the deal. You'll get the Moto Edge 50 Fusion in this deal for just Rs 19,999, which is under Rs 20K. And the links to the deals are given in the description. And let me tell you about another gaming phone which has a good deal. And again, iQOO is launching value for money phones. And this one is iQOO Z9s Pro. And you know, it comes on the 7th Gen 3, which has a good AnTuTu score of 8.5L. So you can easily do 60FPS gaming. You can play BGMI on 60FPS. And if I talk about this segment, then the 7th Gen 3 is a new processor, power efficient & one of the most capable processors in this price range. And for gamers, you get an Ultra Game Mode, Motion Controller & a Vegan Leather design which looks nice. Thermals are also in check. And if I talk about the camera, it's a 50MP camera with 16MP selfie camera. I'm showing you some samples of that as well, so go & check it out. But let's talk about the deal. I forgot to tell you that the battery is of 5500mAh. This is really thin & slim but still it's a 5500mAh battery. And it has 80W charging. And if I talk about the deal price of the iQOO Z9s Pro, you'll get it for Rs 21,749. But you'll get it on Amazon. And finally, let's talk about Realme's number series. Realme 13 Pro is known for its camera. It has a Snapdragon processor with good ISP. So this is definitely camera centric. And Realme's number series phones generally have good cameras. If I talk about the camera, it has a 50MP light sensor, 8MP ultrawide & 32MP selfie camera. And I'm showing you samples on the screen, you're going to like it. The colours, details & dynamic range of this camera is really good. It's one of the better cameras out there in this particular price range. Even in low light, the photos come out quite good. If I talk about the processor, it's the same as the Motorola H50 Fusion. It's the same 7S Gen 2 with an AnTuTu score of 6.10L & 6.20L. It has good connectivity too. It has Wi-Fi 6 & it supports all 5G bands in India. And the processor also makes a difference in connectivity. So if you have a Snapdragon, you get good connectivity because of its modem. And this one has Wi-Fi 6, so no problems there. If I talk about the battery, it's a 5200mAh battery with 45W charging. Let's talk about the deal, that's important, so wait for that. You're going to get the Realme 13 Pro in this deal at Rs 21,999. And it's also available on Flipkart. And as I said, all the deals mentioned have their links in the description. Which deal did you like the most out of these deals? Do let us know in the COMMENTS! Also, we've made this video in collaboration with Qualcomm. But these deals are there & we've told you that we've liked them. This might be the last deal video of 2024, so don't forget to share it with your friends! That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"
niiOpwSonx0,Oxygen OS 15 - No. It&#39;s Not an iOS Clone!,"OxygenOS 15 is finally here and in this video, we've done a deep dive of the new features that has come with OxygenOS 15.",Trakin Tech English,2024-10-24T16:00:54Z,28,"['Trakintech', 'trakin Tech English', 'oxygenos 15', 'oxygenos 15 features', 'oneplus oxygenos 15', 'oxygen os 15', 'oxygenos 15 review', 'oxygenos 15 changes',

hindi']",PT10M27S,499952,1188,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology'],True,so Spotify is running on iOS 18 and oxygen OS 15 right now and look at this they literally lifted Apple's live activities on Dynamic Island and they use this as live alerts right now it looks very similar right essentially what happens is that in iOS 18 and oxygen 15 you can move certain apps to a little window at the top as a live activity or a live alert and you can expand the activity there itself see I'll show you so on iOS you have to tap and hold and on this you just have to tap it but oxygen os5 made it its own and it does two things better lets you choose if you want to tap to expand the card or you want to open the app so you have that choice in your hands but more importantly if you put two supported apps to Live alerts and if you tap it then you have an expanded stack with two expanded cards and you know what oxygenos 15 is full of these inspired but improved moments so for the sake of this video I'm going to categorize all the new features in oxygen os5 into three categories original inspired and improved or copied and yes there is a different between inspired and copied so basically when I do this at the end of the video you can figure out how you feel about oxyen o5 kapish all right I'm Asad you're watching track and te English your destination for detailed incisive catet [Music] reviews the moment I started using oxyen 15 the first thing that struck me were the improved animations it's smoother it's faster it's more consistent than any other operating system I've used till date yes that also includes Apple's IOS this is the first big upgrade that you see and it's called parallel animations so when you open an app and close it and then open another app immediately after you close it or in between that action itself the animations flow smoothly there is literally no starter so when you actually open and close 20 apps side by side on oxygenos 15 and oxygenos 14 and you see them side by side and you will realize how good it looks and the fun fact is that oxygenos 14 was smooth to begin with and the animation improvements also extend to other parts of the system for example when you're opening a folder and one thing that we notice is that when you have a widget on the screen for example the clock widget and you open it even that animation is really smooth in fact if you look at it on iOS 18 it's kind of stuttery there's also a new charging animation there's a new Holo fingerprint animation and the volume slider has this thin volume slider too so when it comes to the new animations oxygen os5 is original and good and if you folks think that tracking English content is also original and good then we'd love your support go hit that subscribe button if you haven't already now I keep saying this over and over again primarily because like like a lot of you watch our videos but only very few of you subscribe so it'll help us out oh by the way one more thing I must mention is that oxygenos 15 on future OnePlus phones for example OnePlus 13 will actually have a 20% lighter install on the system which means that you will have more storage space for you to use now we also asked why that cannot be implemented on you know OnePlus 12 that's because the new hardware the new system the new software all of that have to work together so that is why oxygen o5 will be a lighter install on OnePlus 30 also oxygen o 15 has made great improvements to the always on display and the lock screen the new flux themes seamlessly blend your wallpaper clock style and additional info with the all on display lock screen and the home screen there are a few different styles to choose from and you can use any wallpaper to create a gorgeous depth effect on the lock screen but all of the text that you see is all preed you can't create your own text or write your own text which I feel is like what I mean shouldn't given us the option right because most of the text that OnePlus has given you option for apart from never settle of course are all pretty lame motivational codes I would never use them now for aod and lock screen changes I'll rate it inspired and improved another change is that quick settings can now be used in Split mode so when you swipe down from the top right you can see the quick settings and the notifications are at the top left of course very similar to how iOS and a lot of Android skins do these days and the Quick Settings design has been slightly updated to it's very well-rounded and looks pretty good again i' rate it inspired and slightly improved as for the rest of the visual changes I noticed a couple of extra icon options I saw Radiance and Shadow and the aquamor has moved to classic style now I like the new icons they do look good plus there are a few new cards in the OnePlus shelf which I don't think I've ever used do you guys actually use it let me know in the comment section below but the widget Pages design is the exact same plus the app drawer is exactly the same as well no changes there there's a neat little Easter egg in oxygen o5 now and I think a few of you will remember it how nice is that but of course not just this the feature upgrades are also very very interesting for example there's a new share with iPhone option apart from Quick Share that works with Android devices it's a little bit of a convoluted process but it works the first time you share a file with iOS oxy 15 will share a QR code which will make your iPhone download the op plus Connect app once downloaded there's a Wi-Fi connection created between the two phones and then you can transfer your files easily I mean of course it's a workaround and it's making you download an app on iPhone but at least they figured out a solution now I won't have to use local all the time at least on OnePlus devices now this feature is definitely an original one of my favorite features with OnePlus open was the OnePlus canvas and a mini version of the OnePlus canvas has been extended to oxygen os5 no you cannot have a triple window setup you can still have a double windows split screen only but now when you watch a YouTube video you can expand it much further nearly to 80 to 85% of the screen on oxygen 14 you can see that it cannot expand to this level also I like the fact that you can actually copy an image save it to file doc as and then move it to say a Notes app or a messaging app within that same split screen it's all very well done of course AI upgrades are here too and a big chunk of them are in the photos app AI unblur is a new Option so if you have a slightly blurry photo it adds details and makes it look better and the results that we got were of course very very impressive now one feature that's already there in oxygenos 14 is AI eraser but you do have a new eraser for Reflections now when I tested it out the reflections around uh the environment it was doing a fairly good job job of like you know reducing it but if the reflections were on a subject for example on a car window or on a car logo that wouldn't get erased but I still feel that it's very very useful but the new AI detail boost has to be my favorite feature you can basically crop into any picture to frame your picture according to what you want and not worry about detail loss so the AI boost actually adds more details it's called 4K UHD for some reason I don't know why but that boost is done so Tastefully that I actually liked it more than superr zoom on Pixel it doesn't look artificial which is nice so all of the AI features again inspired from other operating systems but improved in performance which is good the notes app also has a bunch of AI features and they are all specific to writing so you can format text clean up polish shorten and change the tone and elaborate this is very similar to how Apple intelligence works on iOS 18.1 iOS 18.1 has nice animations similarly green color animations are there on oxygen os5 as well it does look good of course the results of how these edits happen and how both of these edit stuff are completely different but I actually prefer Apple's job compared to OnePlus but still OnePlus is doing a fairly decent job however one thing that oxygen os does and apple intelligence does not is elaborate so you basically write a piece of text and if you want it to elaborate based on contextual information that it can find from the internet then it can do it on its own but if you ask me all the AI features added to notes feels like yes for the very first time in this whole video a copy also what I noticed is that since OnePlus uses Google keyboard you can't get all of these writing features or writing tools when you're actually maybe composing a text message which is possible with apple Intelligence on the iPhone I mean there's something called AI reply with oxygen os5 but unfortunately that wasn't working I mean AI reply would probably be like it's generating own responses depending on what message you get right and there's something called intelligent search which basically gives you contextual search results so you can ask it what times my and then it'll look through your phone and if it has the answer it'll give you the answer but unfortunately this feature was also not working in the beta that we tested however I did notice something new AI summary and AI speak when I use the smart sidebar so when you open any web page or a long text basically maybe even a PDF you can get simple summaries or make AI speak the article for you again these are things that iOS already does Arun Pro TR and techy has now transformed into a 1.4 core strong family on YouTube I do feel that the AI features in the photos app are actually pretty good but with the other aspects of the system like for example AI notes there is a little bit of Polish required but at least the foundation is there and they can start working on it on future updates and finally oxygenos 15 has also added a bunch of Android 15 features so Circle to search is here finally there's pass scan as well which scans your boarding pass and adds it to Google Wallet the default assistant can be Google gin now even gin live works I tried it out and I've been enjoying using G and Android 15's Theft Protection is here as well considering Android 15 didn't have too many features this is really nice all right so I know I haven't tested the camera performance improvements or battery life improvements primarily because this is a closed beta and all of my data would be invalid until the stable release happens but in this video I'm sure that you must have gotten a look at what are the you know new oxygen os5 features so what do you guys think do you actually like oxygen os5 do you think it's nice do you think that it's a copy of all the other features across other brands or do you think that they've used like you know basically been inspired and created interesting stuff I'd love to know your thoughts let me know in the comment section below but you know what I'll tell you this we've tested a bunch of Android 15 skins and Android 15 itself like for example F 15 nothing OS 3.0 and now oxygen os5 of all that I've tested the oxygen os5 update seems like the most number of feature updates that we've tested till now and it is also very very good until maybe one UI drops because leaks are saying that it's going to be a massive one this year by the way this is exactly what color5 is also going to be with a few design changes here and there oxy 15 is not entirely unique anymore we'll have to make peace with that all right that's it for me for this one I'll see you guys in the next one until then keep tracking and stay safe
hUeZkBJZ1Eo,Every Crazy Emerging Technology That Will Change The World,Join my Discord to discuss this video: https://discord.gg/yj7KAs33hw Every famous emerging technology gets explained in 11 ...,The Paint Explainer,2024-10-17T13:10:55Z,27,[],PT11M25S,494595,1565,,[],True,"neuralink neuralink is one of the first examples of implantable brain computer interfaces and as of now it's mostly being used for medical purposes such as improving the quality of life for paralyzed people the next neuralink missions are blindsight with the objective of restoring vision and blind patients and telepathy which is pretty self-explanatory this is the first stage of these types of technology and as time goes on we might start doing stuff like downloading information from the Internet Straight Into the brain making us super intelligent and a master at whatever task without the need to study or practice it's possible that a sort of brain internet becomes reality where we're connected with everyone else and we might even become a hive mind with immense amounts of knowledge you can imagine how incredibly powerful it would be to have every single human brain combined but this would come at the expense of individuality and with the moral consequence that people who don't join the hive mind would be severely impaired when compared against it of course this is all speculative as it's not known if it's possible to upload our Consciousness into the digital world but if it is humanity might reach immortality either by putting its Consciousness into robots or by entering a digital simulation where time is diluted thus giving us a subjective sense of immortality also super virtual reality video games where you're actually in the game might come to reality it's important to note that if all of this is possible it could come with great risk as if these types of Technologies were to be manipulable or hackable by others you'd be giving your perception to someone else for eternity enabling him to do crazy stuff like putting you in eternal hell crisper Gene editing this one is like a high Precision tool for cutting and editing DNA and when it becomes even better thanks to research it might enable us to do real life customization on living things such as changing height body shape hair or eye color and talent such as super intelligence this will of course cause the eradication of many diseases genetic and non- genetic and the rise of the use of Highly personalized Medical Treatments not only that but it could be used in crops for more efficiency more protection against parasites and more nutrients potentially eradicating famine altogether as of now the main limitation is that the stuff used for this technology comes from bacteria and for this reason the transport system to the Target site is problematic because when they are transferred to a host cell it produces an immune response against them thus disabling them another big thing is the ethical problems with this technology which causes research to be slowed down or stopped by policies such as the one by the World Health Organization which ask to put a stop to crisper experiments that cause the birth of altered humans since these types of genetic editing will probably be inheritable people say that future Generations can't give consent to the genetic changes that could affect their lives and that a phenomenon called designer babies will emerge where people design their baby just like how they want it to be playing as God also long-term side effects aren't well known so it could be seen as playing with future people's lives Quantum Computing a quantum computer uses quantum physics to perform tasks much faster than a classical computer for example in 2019 Google demonstrated that it could complete a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful classical supercomputer at the time 10,000 years to finish they're mostly better at cryptography and machine learning while it's thought that for easier tasks classical computers can be faster the machine learning part is especially important for artificial general intelligence which we'll talk about later on in the video a theory called Quantum Supremacy says that once we have better quantum computers we will be able to make them perform tasks and solve problems that can't be solved by current class classical computers giving us an incredible amount of other scientific discoveries but also completely bypassing every cryptography effort which might be problematic if cryptography doesn't find new ways to improve at the same time if someone had such quantum computers right now he could probably enter every Top Secret website or database without a problem also quantum computers might enable us to make faster and better quality simulations such as that of molecular systems thus speeding up discoveries in every field such as medicine and medical materials in our example the main challenge as of now is improving the number of Q bits while managing errors at the same time humanoid robots once AI becomes good enough for physical and risky tasks we'll be able to make them do them instead of humans to increase safety this would come with the automation of physical jobs before the automation of every single job even the cognitive and artistic ones whether it's a good thing or not is debatable every person would probably have a personal robot assistant especially for the elderly we would see the rise of robotic Sports and the use of humanoid robots for error-free surgeries also without a doubt they will be used for sexual purposes as of now the closest thing we have to humanoid robots are the ones from Boston Dynamics which you might have already seen generative AI generative AI is in its first stages as AI produced content is still detectable by a keen eye but with time it will become impossible to tell the difference from real life this comes with the democratization of content creation a similar phenomenon to the video game industry where indie developers can now produce better games than multi-millionaire Studios at some point we will be able to create cartoons films video games and education materials with a single prompt enabling each person to play customized video games created by them this will come with the eradication of many occupations which seems to be happening at a small scale with programmers and voiceover artists after AIS have gotten better at generating lines of codes and realistic speech also it will become increasingly harder to rely on videos or photos as proof be it in or for public opinion and disinformation will be much easier to spread and multiply starlink starlink is a satellite internet constellation that enables areas with no internet connection to receive it with time it will probably become the fastest data transmission method and it will be crucial for communication between planets if humans start colonizing them for this reason it's one of the most important steps for the future of long-term space missions and the advancement towards Humanity being a type 2 civilization artificial wombs artificial wombs would bypass the problem of fertility and potentially the demographic problem that hits developed countries with low birth rates its goal is to replicate the environment of the natural womb to grow baby humans and it will be one of the most crucial steps for space colonization as it's one of the only ways of creating new humans in space environments fusion power this one is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions and it's one of the most currently researched types of energy resources this could provide us with almost Limitless and clean energy in the future reversing climate change and reducing the cost of electricity to zero thus enabling us to reach the poorest zones of the world and to complete projects that would require too much energy as of now Internet of Things The Internet of Things refers to a web of smart devices connected to each other and with machine learning AI it would be able to customize itself to your preferences automatically for example if it were in your home it would be able to close the light at the right time and keep you constantly at the perfect temperature if put in cities it would be incredibly efficient for traffic flow waste management and Public Safety potentially eradicating crime in its later stage we would be able to collect real-time data about the air quality water quality how full places or parks are and we'd be able to autom manage appointments this obviously comes with the greater risk of hacking and abuse from authoritative sources to gain power autonomous cars 43,000 people in the US die from car crashes and this would potentially solve it no more driving licenses or driving training would be needed and if an autonomous vehicle could be integrated with smart cities it would be incredibly efficient in getting us to places much much faster this would come with the unemployment of taxi drivers and the reduction of needing one car per person with the rise of the phenomenon of car sharing however one of the most famous ethical problems is found in this field should automated cars prioritize protection of the passenger or of others space tourism as of now Rich tourists are able to go into suborbital flights with service like blue origin which enables them to see Earth from space but with time it will become the norm to stay in space hotels with features like zero gravity Sports to enjoy while traveling between planets the goal would be to make travel between planets as easy as traveling between countries mixed reality at one point either through the use of Technologies like neuralink or through special glasses we'll be able to fuse the virtual world into reality for example we'd be able to go into a store and see prices on items as we watch them or have virtual education environments in real life like medical students being able to perform surgeries on fake virtual patients or history students going in the actual historical time they're studying this type of Technology would also enable us to talk face Toof face to someone distant potentially removing the social problems currently caused by too much online interaction 3D printing 3D printing is only used for really specific tasks as of now but with time we will be able to print organs and tissues removing the need for organ donations and enabling us to print houses skyscreen scrapers cars Etc this would also allow for local and ond demand production without the need for long Supply chains and large inventories like we do now this would also be one of the key components for human space colonization as sending stuff from Earth to other planets could be really costly at one point we might be able to have replicators which are Advanced machines able to create anything by combining atoms such as food materials or whatever else blockchain decentralized blockchain currencies might be the primary form of currency in the future as they have the probable benefits of less inflation democratization of currency and the impossibility of Faking historical payments Financial platforms would be decentralized and people would be able to lend borrow and invest money without needing Financial intermediaries this would come with potentially less economic power for the government if it does not own the blockchain currency as it could be much more difficult to collect taxes if we take a look at the generalized benefits of the blockchain technology when not applied to money it will enable us to have better ID systems for privacy and ID protection against fraud better Supply chains in companies and even fraud-proof voting systems AGI AGI stands for artificial general intelligence and it's a more advanced level of AI that can understand learn and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks just like humans do when we reach AGI our current way of living will probably be more different than the jump humans made from prehistory to the Modern Age the fact is that it might happen sooner than we might think an exop AI employee estimated that we could reach a AGI in 2027 and the ability of AI to do research on AI creating a positive feedback loop that will cause what is called the intelligence explosion which is an incredibly rapid progress you can imagine how effective it would be by trying to picture hundreds of millions of AI researchers working on improving AI at their best efficiency night and day 24/7 with each AI researcher being 10 times faster than a human researcher this could come with an explosion of new scientific discoveries such as the eradication of every single disease and famine from the world and technologies that we can't even think about just like a prehistoric human couldn't have been able to imagine what Bluetooth is another scenario to keep in mind is that explosive technological discoveries come with explosive military discoveries such as easily accessible weapons of mass destruction that will necessitate just one criminal to destroy Earth if you want to discuss this video or suggest an idea for the next one join my Discord

don't think anybody knows how they did it in the shadows of ancient pyramids and beneath the Desert Sands the mysteries of Egypt's Advanced Technologies Whisper of a civilization far ahead of its time hieroglyphs and timeworn monuments reveal more than just a rich history they unveil a legacy of Ingenuity that challenges our understanding of the past from enigmatic structures hinting at Global Communication networks to artifacts suggesting knowledge of electricity and Aviation ancient Egypt's technological prowess beckons us to explore its Secrets join us as we journey through time uncovering the most compelling cases of advanced ancient technology found in Egypt the oseran an enigmatic underground Temple deep within the ancient city of abidos a perplexing mystery lies hidden beneath the sands of time the oseran an underground Temple shrouded in enigma challenges our understanding of ancient Egyptian history and Technology this sprawling complex with its massive Granite blocks and precise craftsmanship defies the conventional timeline of Egyptian civilization hinting at the possibility of a far more ancient origin one of the most striking anomalies of the oseran is its lack of inscriptions and decorations a stark contrast to the typical Egyptian temples adorned with intricate hieroglyphs this absence of textual evidence has led researchers to question the true age and purpose of the structure could it be that the oyan predates the dynastic period of ancient Egypt serving as a remnant of a long-lost civilization the Precision and scale of the oseran construction are truly breathtaking massive Granite blocks some weighing up to 100 tons form the core of the temple these colossal Stones were transported from the distant quaries of Aswan over 200 Mi away and fitted together with astounding accuracy the logistics involved in moving and placing these enormous blocks raise questions about the technological capabilities of the ancient Builders did they possess Advanced Machinery or forgotten methods that enabled them to achieve such Feats perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the oseran is the mysterious water that continuously flows within its Chambers despite attempts to pump out the water it inexplicably returns defying explanation hydrological Studies have revealed that the water in the oseran is remarkably different from the surrounding groundwater with a unique chemical composition and isotopic profile this anomaly has led some researchers to speculate about the existence of hidden Chambers or passages beneath the temple possibly connecting to an unknown water source some theories suggest that the osirion could have served as a center for advanced technological or spiritual practices While others propose that it may have been a repository of ancient wisdom waiting to be rediscovered the Giza power plant Theory pyramids as energy generators the Great Pyramid of Giza one of the world's most iconic structures has long been a source of Fascination and mystery standing at an impressive height of 481 ft and built with an estimated 2.3 million Limestone blocks each weighing between 2.5 to 15 Tons the pyramid's construction has baffled experts for centuries however some researchers suggest that the Great Pyramid was not merely a tomb but an advanced technological Marvel designed to harness and distribute energy the Precision and scale of the great pyramid's construction are genuinely astounding the pyramid's base covers an area of 13 acres with each side measuring 700 56 ft in length the ancient Builders achieved an extraordinary level of accuracy with the average deviation from a perfect square being less than 0.1% this Precision combined with the pyramid's Unique Interior Design has led some researchers to propose that the structure was built to generate and harness energy one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the Giza power plant theory is the presence of conductive materials within the pyramid the Great Pyramid contains several large Granite beams some weighing up to 70 tons which are highly conductive Additionally the pyramid's inner Chambers and passages are lined with highly polished Limestone which could have acted as an insulator this combination of conductive and insulating materials has led some researchers to suggest that the pyramid may have been designed to act as a giant capacitor or battery another intriguing aspect of the Giza power plant theory is the potential connection between the pyramid its underground Chambers and the Nile River some researchers propos that the pyramid's Subterranean Chambers and tunnels could have been part of a sophisticated hydraulic system designed to channel water from the Nile River and generate energy through the flow of water this theory is supported by the discovery of a series of underground channels and shafts some of which appear to be connected to the Nile the Giza power plant Theory also suggests that the pyramid's location and orientation may have been deliberately chosen to harness the Earth's natural energy Fields the pyramid is situated on a powerful Vortex of electromagnetic energy and its precise alignment with the cardinal directions could have allowed it to channel and amplify this energy obelisks potential energy transmitters the ancient Egyptian obelisks monolithic structures carved from single blocks of of granite and reaching Heights of up to 100 ft have long been admired for their beauty and precision often associated with sun worship these towering monuments have captivated the imaginations of countless Generations however some researchers suggest that obelisks may have served a far more practical and even technological purpose potentially acting as energy transmitters or components in a larger interconnected power grid the scale and precision of ancient Egyptian OB s are truly remarkable the largest known Obelisk the lateran obelisk in Rome stands at an impressive 105 ft tall and weighs an estimated 455 tons the process of quaring transporting and erecting these massive monoliths would have required Advanced engineering knowledge and sophisticated tools some researchers propose that the ancient Egyptians may have used techniques such as acoustic levitation or even anti-gravity technology to move and position these enormous Stones one of the most intriguing theories surrounding the purpose of obelisks is their potential role in generating and transmitting energy some researchers suggest that the obelisks when paired with the pyramids and other structures could have formed a vast interconnected power grid across the ancient Egyptian landscape this theory proposes that the obelisks may have acted as antennas or energy transmitters channeling and dispersing energy generated by the pyramids or other sources the idea of obelisks as energy transmitters is supported by several factors including their precise alignment with the cardinal directions their location on powerful energy vortexes and their use of conductive materials such as gold and copper some researchers even suggest that the hieroglyphs and symbols carved into the obelisks could have served as a form of coding or instructions for the transmission of energy another puzzling aspect of ancient Egyptian obelisks is the question of how they were transported and erected the most common theory suggests that the obelisks were moved using sleds rollers and ramps with hundreds or even thousands of workers pulling them across the desert however some researchers propose that the ancient Egyptians may have used more advanced methods such as the use of levers pulleys or even Sonic levitation to move these massive Stones The Great Sphinx mysterious colossal Monument rising majestically from the Giza Plateau the Great Sphinx with its Lion's body and human head has captivated people's imaginations for centuries however beneath the timeworn Visage of this iconic statue lie secrets that have puzzled researchers and challenged our understanding of History one of the enduring debate surrounding the Great Sphinx is its age while conventional egyptology dates the monument to around 2500 BCE during the reign of pharaoh cafrey a growing body of evidence suggests that the Sphinx may be far older geologist Robert shock after examining the erosion patterns on the Sphinx's enclosure walls proposed that the monument could date back to his early as 7,000 bcee a time when the region experienced a much wetter climate this theory if proven true would radically alter our perception of ancient Egyptian civilization and its technological capabilities another intriguing Theory suggests that the Great Sphinx may have been part of a larger interconnected complex designed to harness the power of the sun The Monument's precise alignment with the Rising Sun on the spring and Autumn equinoxes has led some researchers to speculate that it could have functioned as a solar powerered machine or a sophisticated AST astronomical tool the presence of a complex network of Chambers and tunnels beneath the Sphinx revealed by seismic surveys further fuels this hypothesis hinting at the possibility of hidden mechanisms or energy harnessing devices in recent years the use of advanced technology such as ground penetrating radar and seismic imaging has provided tantalizing evidence of hidden Chambers and passages beneath the Great Sphinx these discoveries have reignited Ed interest in The Monument's true purpose and the secrets it may hold some researchers believe that these Chambers could contain ancient artifacts Scrolls or even Advanced technological devices waiting to be uncovered the Sakara bird and the abido hieroglyphs theories of ancient flight in the Sands of Egypt two small artifacts have sparked a heated debate about the possibility of Aeronautical Knowledge and flying technology in ancient times the Sakara bird and the abidos hieroglyph these enigmatic objects have puzzled researchers and enthusiasts alike raising intriguing questions about the extent of ancient Egyptian Innovation and the potential for lost or forgotten Technologies the Sakara bird a small wooden statuette discovered in 1898 in the Tomb of padim men in Sakara immediately captured the attention of researchers due to its uncanny resemblance to a modern airplane measuring 7 in long and weighing less than 1 .4 Oz the bird features Wings mounted on a narrow body with a vertical stabilizer on its tail notably the bird is missing legs and its wings exhibit an advanced aerodynamic shape reminiscent of aircraft Wings rather than typical depictions of birds in ancient Egyptian art some researchers such as Egyptian doctor and model airplane Enthusiast khil MSA have proposed that the Sakara bird is evidence of ancient Egyptian knowledge of aona itical principles and may have served as a model glider Messa built a scaled up model of the bird and found that it exhibited remarkable gliding capabilities leading him to suggest that the ancient Egyptians had a sophisticated understanding of aerodynamics and may have even experimented with flying machines similarly the abidos hieroglyphs found in the temple of seti 1 in abidos have fueled speculation about ancient Egyptian flying techn technology these wall carvings discovered by Dr Ruth hover depict what appear to be modern vehicles including helicopters submarines and airplanes while some Scholars argue that these carvings are merely the result of palum sests or the layering of hieroglyphs over time others see them as evidence of a highly Advanced civilization with knowledge of aerial and underwater Transportation the Sakara bird and the abidos hieroglyphs are not the only artifacts that have prompted theories of ancient flight in Egypt other examples include the enigmatic relief carvings at the Temple of p in Memphis which depict a human figure seated in a pod-like object with what appear to be wings or blades and the Curious helicopter hieroglyphs found in the temple of Osiris at abidos which bear a striking resemblance to Modern rotorcraft Tuten Common's meteoric dagger a Marvel of ancient Metallurgy in 192 2 Howard Carter's discovery of Tuten Common's tomb stunned the world revealing a treasure Trove of ancient Egyptian artifacts and offering unprecedented insights into the life of a young Pharaoh among the many Marvels uncovered within the tomb was a small unassuming dagger that would later prove to be one of the most enigmatic and technologically advanced objects of its time Tuten kon's meteoric dagger at first glance the dagger appeared to be a work of exceptional craftsmanship with it gold handle and sheath adorned with intricate designs however it was the blade itself that really caught researchers attention unlike the bronze blades typical of the period Tuten Common's dagger was forged from Iron a material that was incredibly rare and valuable in ancient Egypt subsequent analyses of the dagger's composition revealed that it was not just any iron but meteoric iron containing significant levels of nickel and Cobalt this discovery raised intriguing questions about the ancient Egyptians understanding of Metallurgy and their ability to work with such a challenging material the process of forging a blade from meteoric Iron would have required Advanced knowledge of smelting Heating and hammering techniques skills that were not thought to have been developed until much later in human history the presence of meteoric iron in Tuten kon's dagger also sheds light on the ancient Egyptians fascination with the heavens and their belief in the divine origins of certain materials meteoric iron known as iron from the sky was considered a sacred substance imbued with the power of the Gods the use of this Celestial material in the creation of a royal dagger suggests that it held profound symbolic and spiritual significance one of the most remarkable aspects of Tuten cun's meteoric dagger is the level of crafts manip and skill required to shape and polish the blade the iron from meteorites is typically harder and more brittle than terrestrial iron making it difficult to work with using traditional Bronze Age tools now it's time for today's subscriber pick one of the most intriguing pieces of pre- Egyptian technology left by an advanced civilization that disappeared is their astonishing Stone carving and Metallurgy some structures found in Egypt are so intricate that even with modern tools replicating them would be a challenge but the most mysterious is the black colored shist disc also known as the disc of SAU this meticulously crafted Stone object features a design strikingly similar to Modern Machinery measuring approximately 2 ft in diameter the shist disc is made from a fragile stone called metail stone or shist its precision and complexity are remarkable the disc features three equid curved loes separated by small drill holes and a central Hub with a thin Hollow tube the thinness of the lobes and overall delicacy has puzzled experts as the required tools and techniques were thought Beyond ancient Egyptian Craftsmen intriguingly the shis disc resembles modern-day impellers a key component in centrifugal pumps and turbines this has led some researchers to propose that the disc could be part of a larger more advanced mechanism possibly used for irrigation water management or even energy generation what are your thoughts on this let us know in the comments the dendera light evidence of ancient lighting technology in the haor temple at dendera Egypt a series of enigmatic carvings have sparked a heated debate about the potential use of electricity in ancient times these reliefs dating back to the talic period depict what appear to be light bulb like objects complete with snake-like filaments and Lotus shaped bases the dendera light reliefs show figures holding aof large elongated objects that bear a striking resemblance to modern-day light bulbs the objects are depicted with snake-like forms inside which some researchers interpret as filaments the bases of the objects are Lotus shaped with a peculiar device beneath them that seems to be connected to a power source this combination of elements has led some to propose that the ancient Egyptians may have had access to a form of electrical lighting one of the most intriguing aspects of the dendera light theory is the absence of suot in some Egyptian temples in the haor temple for example the ceilings and walls are free from the black residue typically associated with the use of torches or oil lamps this lack of soot suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have used an alternative cleaner light Source such as electrical lighting proponents of the dendera light Theory such as electrical engineer Walter gar have created working replicas based on the temple reliefs these experiments demonstrate that a device similar to the dendera light could produce a viable if dim light source however Skeptics argue that the reliefs are merely symbolic representations of mythological scenes and that there is no concrete evidence of electrical Lighting in ancient e Egypt the serapium of Sakara enigmatic Granite boxes and precision craftsmanship deep beneath the shifting Sands of Sakara an ancient necropolis near the fame step pyramid lies a perplexing Marvel of engineering and craftsmanship the serapium this Subterranean complex a Labyrinth of tunnels and Chambers is home to 24 colossal black granite boxes each weighing up to 100 tons and displaying a level of precision that def F explanation these enigmatic containers have baffled archaeologists and researchers for centuries raising questions about their purpose and the ancient technology used to create them the boxes of the serapium measuring up to 13t in length 11 ft in width and 9 ft in height are crafted from solid blocks of black granite one of the hardest Stones known to mankind the Precision with which these boxes were cut and Polished is astonishing with perfectly flat surfaces precise 90° angles and intricately fitted Lids the scale and accuracy of these artifacts seemed to surpass the capabilities of Bronze Age tools leading many to question the mainstream explanations for their creation according to Conventional egyptology the serapium was built during the reign of pharaoh camet in the 13th century BCE to house the mummified remains of sacred apis Bulls however inconsistencies in this Theory have fueled speculation about the true purpose of the Granite boxes some researchers argue that the absence of inscriptions decorations or any trace of the supposed mummified Bulls within the boxes suggests that they may have served a different more technologically advanced purpose the questions surrounding the serapium extend beyond the boxes themselves the logistics of transporting these immense Stone containers into the underground Chambers through narrow tunnels and shafts pose significant engineering challenges the Precision and scale of the serum's construction with its perfectly aligned corridors and symmetrical layout hint at a level of technological sophistication that seems in congruous with the tools and techniques of the time the valley Temple of kafra precision and anomalies at the foot of the Great Sphinx of Giza lies the valley Temple of kafra an ancient Marvel that showcases the the extraordinary precision and Engineering prowess of its Builders constructed with massive Limestone blocks weighing up to 150 tons and faced with polished red granite this Temple has endured for thousands of years bearing witness to the rise and fall of civilizations one of the most striking features of the valley Temple is the use of enormous precisely cut Limestone blocks in its construction these blocks some of which measure up to 18 ft in length and weigh as much as 150 tons were transported from quaries located miles away and fitted together with such Precision that a thin blade cannot be inserted between them the level of accuracy achieved in the cutting and placement of these blocks is astounding especially considering the tools and techniques believed to have been available at the time another puzzling aspect of the valley Temple is the presence of advanced engineering techniques such as the use of square sockets and projecting bosses to secure the granite facing stones to the Limestone core these methods which are not found in other ancient Egyptian structures of the same period suggest that the Builders of the valley Temple possessed a sophisticated understanding of Construction principles and had access to Advanced tools and Technologies despite its impressive construction the valley Temple is curiously devoid of inscriptions or decorations unlike most other ancient Egyptian temples this lack of ornamentation has led some researchers to question the Temple's true age and purpose some have suggested that the valley Temple may have been built by a civilization that predated the ancient Egyptians one with access to Advanced Technologies and knowledge that were lost or forgotten over time the valley Temple also shares striking similarities with other enigmatic structures such as the oseran in abidos and the Sphinx Temple which is located just adjacent to the valley Temple these similarities including the use of massive Limestone blocks Precision Engineering and the absence of inscriptions have led some researchers to propose that these structures may have been part of a larger interconnected complex built by a highly Advanced civilization for purposes that remain unknown Egyptian inventions a legacy of innovation and Ingenuity ancient Egypt is renowned for its a inspiring monuments sophisticated art and enduring mythology but its contributions to human Innovation extend far beyond these well-known achievements from everyday objects to groundbreaking Technologies the ancient Egyptians left an indelible mark on the world with many of their inventions still influencing our lives today one of the most notable Egyptian inventions is papyrus a precursor to Modern paper made from the stems of the Papyrus plant this writing material revolutionized recordkeeping and communication in the ancient world the Egyptians also developed a form of cursive writing known as hieratic script which allowed for faster and more efficient recording of information compared to the older hieroglyphic system in the realm of personal grooming and hygiene the ancient Egyptians were Pioneers they created many cosmetic products including eye makeup skin creams and perfumes and wigs made from Human hair or plant fibers Dental Care was also a priority with the invention of toothpaste made from mint salt and dried iris flowers and breath mints made from frankincense and myrr the ancient Egyptians also contributed greatly to timekeeping and astronomy they developed the 365-day calendar which was based on the lunar cycle and the flooding of the Nile River they also created Sun dials and water clocks which allowed for more accurate tracking of time throughout the day in addition the Egyptians were skilled astronomers with a deep understanding of the movement of celestial bodies and their influence on agriculture and religious ceremonies in the field of engineering and construction the ancient Egyptians were truly unparalleled they developed sophisticated surveying and leveling techniques which enabled them to build the pyramids and other Monumental structures with Incredible Precision they also invented the ramp and lever which allowed them to transport and position massive stone blocks weighing several tons the ancient egyptions also made significant strides in agriculture and irrigation they developed the shadu a type of water-lifting device that made irrigation more efficient and the nyom a tool used to measure the water level of the Nile River during the annual flood season this allowed them to predict the success of their crops and plan accordingly they were also Pioneers in medicine and healthc care they developed a variety of Medical Treatments encompassing surgery Herbal Remedies and even prosthetic limbs they established medical schools known as houses of life where aspiring Physicians could hone their skills and contribute to the ever evolving body of medical knowledge Egyptian Physicians possessed a remarkable understanding of anatomy trauma and treatment as evidenced by groundbreaking discoveries such as the Edwin Smith Papyrus this this medical text dating back to 1500 BC systematically documents 48 cases of traumatic injury to various body parts it meticulously details the closure of wounds with sutures the prevention of infection using honey and moldy bread and the immobilization of fractures using splints and bandages fashioned from linen and wood other ancient Papi such as the eers and cahun delve into a wide range of medical topics including gynecology fertility contraception intestinal disease and more while many remedies involved magical incantations the Egyptians empirical observations of illness were remarkably sophisticated for their time the Jed pillar an enigmatic symbol of ancient Egypt amidst the countless wonders and Mysteries of ancient Egypt the Jed pillar stands as a Timeless symbol its true meaning and sign ific an shrouded in The Mists of time this enigmatic emblem often associated with the god Osiris and the concept of stability and regeneration has captivated the minds of researchers and enthusiasts for centuries at first glance the Jed pillar appears to be a simple stylized representation of a column or pillar with four horizontal bars or capitals stacked at top a vertical shaft this design while seemingly straightforward belies a deeper complexity and potential significance some researchers have noted the Striking resemblance between the Jed pillar and the later diagrams of Nicola Tesla the brilliant inventor and pioneer of modern electricity Tesla's designs often featured a vertical column with horizontal plates or coils bearing a remarkable similarity to the ancient Egyptian symbol this resemblance has led some Intrepid researchers to propose a fascinating Theory could the Jed pillar be a representation of an ancient Egyptian understanding of electricity and its potential applications while mainstream egyptology has long interpreted the Jed pillar as a purely religious or mythological symbol the idea that it could encode scientific knowledge is not as far-fetched as it may seem some proponents of this Theory point to the use of the Jed pillar in ancient Egyptian texts and artwork where it is often depicted in association with the concepts of power energy and the life-giving force of the universe they argue that these associations could be interpreted as metaphorical references to the properties of electricity with the Jed pillar serving as a symbolic representation of this invisible yet omnipresent energy others have taken this idea even further suggesting that the ancient Egyptians may have actually harnessed the power of electricity in their temples and monuments they point to the presence of highly conductive materials such as gold and copper in the construction of these structures and the peculiar layout and orientation of certain Chambers and passages which could have served to channel and amplify electrical currents thanks for

Reviewer: marshall8 mathers88 Will technology shape our future?
Or will we? I think Marshall McLuhan insight from
the 1960s is still relevant today. We shape our tools and then
our tools shape us. Radio and TV broadened our world view. Mobile devices and the internet changed
when, where and how we work. Cars expanded our habitats and planes
made our global travelers. Technology creates many new possibilities,
but unfortunately it is also destructive. Transportation pollutes our air. Electronic devices create huge amounts of
electronic waste and digital technologies, gave rise to big tech companies and
sophisticated surveillance systems. And it won't be long before
we have to deal with the consequences of transformational
technologies like AI and Quantum. Now, we often feel that technology
just happens to us, that we have no control over it. But
technology doesn't create itself. It's humans that create technology. More specifically, it's a small group
of people that take the lead. They are the technology optimists,
and I'm one of them. Or at least I used to be one of them. I think I'm a technology optimist
having an identity crisis. I first thought differently
about technology. A few years after having kids meet
my sons Ramsey and Jordan, and especially Jordan is this boy
with an exceptional talent for anything digital. As a baby,
he became physically wild. When he showed my iPhone
at the age of two. He knew how to switch WiFi networks
if he had a slow connection. And at the age of three, he knew 
what he wanted to become in life A YouTube star. And if you have kids,
you might recognize the situation. Your father is going to take
a picture with mommy then you’ll get 
your ice cream. But in any other situation, it looked like this and I was like a
mobile electronic store carrying iPads, game consoles, batteries, extra headsets,
you name it. And I had it with me. And although I facilitated this as a mom,
I was deeply worried at the same time. What does it do to his eyes? Will he need
glasses soon? How about his brains? Are some of the games maybe too violent?
And does he have enough friends? How are his social skills developing? As a mother, I want to limit his screen
time and force him to play outside as I did as a little kid. But I also
have another role in life. In my professional life. I'm
a part time professor at the Delft University of Technology, and I work with companies to speed
up technological innovation. Looking at Jordan as an innovation
professional, I have a very different perspective. I see his affinity and his talent
for digital technologies, and I feel I should nurture this talent and facilitate him to become
whoever he wants to be. And this put me in a very interesting
position because as a professional, I observed my feelings as a mother
with interest and I wondered, what am I afraid of? And
it triggered research. And I found that there's a historical
consistency to how people have worried and how they express these worries
about technological innovation. Basically, humans have fear technology. Since writing was the latest thing, Greek philosophers argued that
writing would be bad for our brains if we would
write everything down We don't have to remember things. It would instill forgetfulness in our
minds and make our knowledge superficial. Fast forward to the printing press. When the upper class feared that
books would spread rebellious and irreligious thoughts amongst
the common people, they feared they would lose control
over what was being printed. Newspapers would hurt social fabric
of society because until then, people physically came together to learn
about the news and talk about it. But with the newspaper, people would be in
their home by themselves reading about the news. Cinemas would
demoralize society. The TV generation would never learn
how to read or write well. And when the Internet arrived, we
saw the most bizarre headlines. The Internet was bad for everything. One of the things being it would make our
knowledge more superficial this time because you would jump 
from article to article without an interest in 
reading longer pieces. And these are just a few examples, but we see similar arguments recurring
over and over again. Loss of cognitive, cognitive
and physical abilities, loss of social skill, loss of morale
and loss of control being the most prominent ones. When we envision societal 
change through technology, we tend to frame it in terms of loss. Let’s look at an example. If you enjoyed playing with Lego as a kid, chances are you'd rather
see your children or grandchildren play with Lego over
a digital game like Minecraft. Most people immediately 
point out what you lose when you move to the digital world. Fine motor
skills and 3D insights. Kids gain another type of fine motor
skills and 3D insight in the digital world. But if you're not
familiar with those yourself, you tend to judge them as less valuable. You maybe even never mastered or tried
Minecraft essentially to digital Lego. You can mine all sorts of materials and
then craft any object you like. And because it's a digital world,
possibilities are endless. If you make a rational comparison
between the two. Minecraft comes out really well. Nevertheless, we stick to
our preference for Lego because we tend to choose what
we understand and value and are familiar with. And if you didn't
grow up with digital games, you're often prejudiced. It's bad for
your eyes, it's bad for your brain. And worst of all, you can get addicted and
that will put you in social isolation. Steven Johnson came up with a brilliant
thought experiment saying, What if books were invented
after video games? So try to imagine for a moment there are
no books, no newspapers, no magazines. You do not read, but you do 
play video games all the time.
And everybody around you does it, it’s a normal thing to do. And all of a sudden books are
invented and kids love it and they start reading like crazy.
But what we say. Chances are we would say it's bad
for your brain because, again, it's a rich multimedia experience
triggering all parts of your brain. And a book is just words on the page. It's bad for creativity and
leadership because in a game you learn how to explore and
you learn about leadership. But in a book, there's no other option
than following the plot. Last but not least, it will put you 
in social isolation because the game you play with others,
whether they’re next to you on the other side of the world, 
it doesn’t matter. But with a book a kid would be in their room by 
themselves for hours and hours reading. And this perfectly
illustrates how your frame of reference shapes your attitude 
towards new technologies. And Douglas Adams, a science
fiction writer, once brilliantly summarized
what's happening here. He shared, Everything you grew up with
is a normal part of the world. Nothing new. Anything invented between
age 15 and 35 is new and exciting, and you can probably get
a career out of it. Anything invented after age 35 is against
the natural order of things. Now, obviously, it's not this black and
white and it doesn't go for everyone. The technology optimists like me tend to
focus on the benefits of new technologies, even when they're older than 35. But lately, I can't help myself
feeling increasingly worried. We apply algorithms to define
if somebody can get a loan, only to find out later that it rightfully
discriminates against certain groups. We let algorithms define what we see on social media influencing
our political attitudes. And soon we will have AI driven
virtual friends that know us so well that we fully trust them
and follow their advice, unaware of the political or
commercial motives behind the algorithms that bring these
virtual friends to life. Looking ahead and taking into account
the fast developments in AI. I am afraid that we will lose
agency and control. I tell myself my fears are grounded that
things are different from the past. Digital technologies are all around us and
their inner workings are invisible. Big tech companies know
everything about us and control what information
we're being exposed to. Startups with a mission to
change the world for the better quickly change character after
venture capitalists pump hundreds of millions of dollars into them, forcing them to quickly scale and monetize everything they
know about their customers. Generative AI is interacting
with us as if it's human, forcing us to rethink what
is real and what is not. I feel change is happening too
fast and we can't oversee the longer term consequences. At the
same time, I know that already. In 1970, Alvin Toffler wrote about future
shock being the anxiety brought on by too much change in too
short a period of time. I know that my worries match historical
arguments against technological innovations. I know that I
didn't grow up with AI, so my frame of reference probably
informs my opinion about it, making me focus on what we lose 
instead of what we gain. This makes me wonder. Am I falling prey to the psychological
processes I've been researching? Am I simply getting old? Is my frame of reference no longer 
fitting today’s reality? The truth is, I really don’t know. And in the past, my life was simple. I was a technology optimist, helping others to see the benefits
of new technology. And now I'm in a process of recalibration, trying to figure out if I should
start warning people for the dangers that lie ahead. But one thing I do know, digital
technologies are developing at lightning speed and we do not have
the luxury to lie low. The technology optimists that work at tech
companies that shape our world focus on the benefits of new technology and
vastly underestimate their dangers and societal impact. If we do nothing, tech companies are free to develop
and apply technology as they like without any ethical or
societal guidelines they must follow. And while we're still struggling to
deal with the implications of AI, figuring out if and how we can control it, we already need to start thinking about the next transformational technology
quantum. Quantum technology. Like quantum computers, we have
the opportunity to think about the ethical, legal and societal aspects
before the technology leaves the lab and is widely applied. This is incredibly difficult, though. We can compare it to the
invention of the laser. Imagine for a moment that we are in
1960 and Ted Maiman just created the first working laser
in his lab, this big, bulky machine with a weak signal
receptive to noise. And at that point in time, we're all already trying to predict
that decades later, we will use lasers to cut through metal
print information on paper, operate on people's eyes, can
barcodes in supermarkets, or even use it as entertainment
in dance parties? It is almost impossible, bordering
on science fiction. But nevertheless, we must
try because quantum is a transformational technology
that will shape the future. We're just not exactly sure yet how, when,
where and through which applications. We need to envision these future
applications to understand its societal impact. We need to understand the
positive and the negative impact to shape a future that we want to live in. We need to start a broad
societal debate today. And I'm lucky to have a role
in this in the Netherlands, thinking about the impact of Quantum. But all of you should have
a role in it, too, because we need people from all cultural
backgrounds, religions, age, socioeconomic status. We need people
with different values and beliefs, and we need the ones who fear technology
as much as the ones who trust it. The future doesn't just happen to us. We shape technology and then technology
shapes our future. And I'm looking for people who want to
think about this future with Quantum. So I invite you to join me and help
shape our future for the better. Thank you very much."

When a person is in a bad mood, he is a good person. What did I say in the beginning, everyone is naked in the bathroom.
I used to hate his face and I decided I will not see his face anymore. Irshad, today or tomorrow you have to speak. It's going on in Irshad's mind. What was your answer? I will prefer to be quiet while showing a little understanding. Alright, India's Biggest Tech Roundtable 2024! Oh my God! We have a loaded panel here. But before starting, I want to say that we had called all the tech creators. We had called Rakesh from Gyan Therapy & Ranjeet. They couldn't come due to some reasons. But we have a panel which anyone will be proud of. Tech is influenced by these people. But that's where I'll stop & I'm going to start with a loaded question. Obviously, Irshad is going to moderate today. But this is pertinent of today's time in the tech YouTube space. There are some YouTubers who are very honest. He is honest everywhere & he is not so honest probably. I want to ask this from the panel. Because I think that is one question which goes on everywhere. You can take Reddit or Twitter. This is what happens everywhere. So I want to ask one by one. Are some YouTubers dishonest & some are honest? Let's start! Who will start? I'll start from there. Alright! So this proves that this is a loaded question. Who's going to say what? I'll go first. I think that all the creators here have their own influence. And I think that everyone is honest in their own way. Everyone collaborates with the brand. Collaborating doesn't mean that the brand will write everything for us. The brand pays us. We get paid in collaboration. It's not like we don't get paid. I'm being honest. Just like you asked the question. The control of the test is on us. How do we tell the audience? How do we show it? Sometimes the brand interrupts us. You have to remove this part. But our stand is that we have to show this part. This is a factual point & we have to show it to the audience. Yes, there are some things that the brand tries to control. But it depends on the creator. If I talk about myself, I directly say that I have to show this point to the audience. I don't know. It doesn't matter if you collaborate with me or not. And if we talk about reviews or honesty, everyone gives their honest opinion. A lot of people comment that you are saying only positive things. But a lot of people don't watch the whole video. They judge by watching half of the video. But if you watch the whole video, every creator has a negative point. You don't have to mention that you are honest. Honesty is a trait that should be there internally. You don't have to mention that you are being honest. That's why I said everyone is honest. And about the collaboration part that you mentioned, the thing that people forget is the meaning of the word collaboration. Collaboration means that you are working with these brands in collaboration. You are not towing the line all the time. Like you mentioned, we do the same. If we have to specifically talk about a product, we put our foot down on things where we say that this is something that we need to mention in the video. We have to be true to our audience which is exactly what everybody wants to do. So basically that's my point. Alright. I think honesty comes from freedom. When you have 10 people sitting in front of you with guns, it's difficult to be honest. Or for example, let's say there are a lot of people who are unable to earn a living. If they have to lie in order to earn a living, I think that's fine. But if they have money and things, they don't have to lie. That is what I feel. And as all tech creators, I feel that a tech creator is something that a normal person can't do. If you don't have an interest in tech, you can't become a tech creator. All the tech creators here, we have to get into it. We need a love for tech. And when someone loves tech, he can't hate his audience for the product. And I have noticed this with all the creators. I have talked to everyone. Now, what happens is, as much as I have noticed, for example, if a phone comes, like I remember, there was a Samsung J series phone, which I made a video on. I mean, I made an opinion video because the brand didn't send it at that time. At that time, there wasn't that much money to buy and make. But I didn't like the initial impression. The processor was bad, everything was bad. Then after 4-5 years, I was going in a cab. There was a cab driver. I asked him, how is the phone? He said, it's a great phone. I have been using it continuously in the cab for the past 3 years. And there is no problem anywhere. The display is good, the touch is good. So, in my opinion, it was a bad phone. And I was honest. But it was a very strong phone for that cab driver. So, my down the line, I understood one thing, in the matter of honesty, or in the matter of telling things, that the same iPhone is bad for one audience. And the same iPhone is very strong for one audience. So, whenever I buy a phone or a piece of technology, for which audience is it good, and for which audience is it bad, I tell them clearly, whether it is a brand, or not, whether the brand has sent it, or not. There are a lot of brands that don't work with us. There are a lot of brands that send us the first units. There are a lot of brands, which let's say, OnePlus also took us to China. I met their CEO. So, our questions don't change. The question is, why is there a green line issue? So, in our end, I don't think any tech creator is dishonest. I think their values are different. But yes, I have a lot of respect. I have a lot of respect for all the people in the tech space. Because there is no love. No one can replace it. From here, Divinder. I think there are two ways to look at it. One is that you are producing a content. You are introducing some product to your audience. You have to be factually right, as Manoj mentioned. You should not be wrong factually. That is the most important thing. You should not create things out of thin air. You don't really have to promote the product. You just have to introduce. And then it's up to the audience, whether to take it or whether to leave it. That is your most important responsibility. But where users should trust us, and where our true influence comes, is when we recommend products. Let's say we are doing a video about the best phones to buy under 15,000, 20,000, 25,000. That is where we add a lot of value. That is where we can tell them, these are the things that are important. If you are a particular kind of person, like if you like gaming, this is a product that you should go for. If you want a clean software experience, you should buy this product. And these things add a lot of value. Because if we don't do that, then it will be very difficult for them to decide and buy. Got it. But the answer to my question, this is not a question, I also want to say something about it. But I'll ask you, if this is the case, what Shlok said, what Devinder said, then why do YouTubers get the tag of honesty? And why is it like this? What's that reason? I know it's a difficult question. No, no, the question is not difficult at all. The answer can be difficult to give. Okay. The question is very simple. And if I say it in one line, everyone is naked in the bath. This is the reality. Now listen to me. How do you get that tag? Or how do those things work? I have crores in my account. I have expensive cars. My house is very nice. But if I have to upload a photo of a new phone on the internet, then I will look for the dirtiest corner of the house. And I will click a photo in such a background that just got this new phone. So that the public can see the garbage in the back corner. I won't show my best part. I mean, I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about creators. Just trying to be relatable. Trying to be humble. Trying to be like, I'm an ordinary man. If we talk about numbers, the audience has no idea. The kind of money that's running. If we talk about money, nobody has an idea. And I won't say numbers because, I mean, unless I have the permission. In tomorrow's conversation. If you have permission, everyone knows everyone's numbers. See, the thing is, what did I say in the beginning? Everyone is naked in the bath. This is the reality. You know exactly that... Okay. Here in the ecosystem. Let's say a brand launches a phone today. Not everyone gets the campaign. That's the reality. Let's say the brand works with 5 creators or 10 or 15. There are definitely people who are left out. Now that depends on their reaction. Sometimes they take this as a grudge. And after 4 days they come with their honest form. That I am honest. See, the brand didn't even send me a phone. So it becomes even more relatable. They say, he was really honest. That's why the brand didn't send him a phone. Now he is speaking the truth. Second thing is, negativity sells faster. If I praise an iPhone today, then why not praise a good phone? But if someone says, iPhone has this problem. So the iPhone which is not afforded, they will say, yes, you are right. Negativity sells. So this is the reality of honesty. In a nutshell, all of us, as an individual, we can say this line, who knows me better than me? Right. When we go to sleep at night, we all know what we have done throughout the day. This is the reality. The question here, also now after this, what happens after this, how does the audience, how do they look at this content and understand? Who is telling the truth or not? How does the audience trust the YouTuber? Just one add-on here. Audience knows everything. They know everything. They are super smart. Sometimes people try to manipulate. Sometimes a few are manipulated. But not for a longer run. At the end, they know what is going on. That's what I think. Prasad, do you have any thought on this? Same thing. Like Gaurav said, the audience knows everything. What we are doing. If you are honest, then only you can survive longer. Yeah, absolutely. Sanchit. See, it's a simple thing. If the question is understood, if the question is to tell me or not, how does a YouTuber get the tag of honesty? This is the question. What I think, first of all, there is a new trend. We have seen different trends in a long time. A new YouTuber comes. I can easily say, B-Bomb has a lot of shortcomings. I can say, you have a lot of shortcomings. And what happens with that is, people think that he is a crazy guy. He has said it on his face. He has made a mess of it. So, he is an honest guy. Basically, poking. It can be poked. So, I have been watching all this for 9 years. You guys have seen it more than me. But yes, I have noticed this trend a lot. There are new trends. First of all, your fellow YouTubers. I will say bad things about you. I will say a lot of bad things about you. I will tell you. He said this in that video. He said this. And I can show myself better. That is a way. And I don't feel bad about it. Because what can happen with this? Will my brand be created? Because in today's time… I will disagree a little. I will disagree a little. You are building your brand by making someone look bad. That is wrong. This is what I feel. Would you respond to somebody who is roasting you? See, I won't do it. Because I don't have that nature. Listen to me. I have been working in this field for more than 10 years. I have never poked anyone. Listen to me. You are my brother. You won't listen. Look, I think that in today's time, all of us are sitting here and we all have a relation with the brand. We have a relation with each other. But if I start YouTube today, it will be very difficult for me to easily fit in this industry and sit among you. Agreed. 100%. So, I will adopt a new technique. Obviously, I will adopt it to look a little better. To look different from you. To look different from you. Whether I take the help of content, whether I speak ill of you, whether I make fun of the brand. At that time, I will see the environment of the internet. So, some people are lucky to take the tag of honesty. Some people get it in the beginning and then gradually they start working with the brand. Then the tag of honesty can be removed. I came up with a lot of theories. I used to sit here with my team and keep talking that how to approach in a balanced way. So, in the beginning, we used to think that we will keep the audience at the top. First, our thought was that we will keep the audience at the top. Then we used to think that we have given a lot of priority to the brand. But I understood over time that everything is important for me.
Obviously, if the brand does not give me the unit time, then how will I make the video on time? If I don't stay true to the audience, then how will I make relations with them? How will they understand me well? Similarly, I gave top priority to everyone. And I tried to maintain a balance. And the most important thing that I think we should address is to mention the collab and put the tag of paid promotion. Yes. I mean, how can we leave this thing? Here, I want to ask one thing to Rupesh. Because he is the newest. Right? Technically not. Technically not. But his channel. Technically, yes. So, do you think when you started a new channel, did you think that you need to take the support of such things to gain the numbers? Do you think that is important? That is important because I don't think so. To a certain extent, I do not accept that honesty is due to luck. I think what he said was absolutely right. It's a very concentrated approach or show to the consumers. Consumers are shown and that is built. Before Rupesh answers, I'll just add in one thing. First, I think Rupesh doesn't need any cheap tactics to do. He has lots of talent. He doesn't need these things. This tag is shown. I'll tell you. Let's say a video of a phone is being made and 10 videos are coming. Or both titles have written real review, real search, honest review, whatever. You know, similar kind of a word is used. Now, you can see the remaining 9 on one side and one is held separately. When you search, let's say as a normal viewer who has got no idea who we people are. He has searched about a phone and he has got 10 videos. In one of them, he has mentioned in the thumbnail or the title that guy would want to go to that video because he thinks that many people don't know how internet works. Whatever he is writing, he must have said it right. Let's open it. That's how it gets built over time. That was one point. Yeah, sorry. So, personally, I hate drama. I hate drama. I hate cheap controversy. So, my clear point was that I'll make videos that I love watching. Very nice. There will be style in the video. There will be good music. So, this was the point of view from the beginning. We'll make good content. Starting, obviously, we didn't get devices. I mean, silicon was fairly new. Still fairly new. We are still not getting a lot of devices. But that was it. But I was sure that with cheap tactics, you can never gain in the long term. That is true. So, the point was that make good videos, make good content, it will automatically work no matter what you do. And I think, like everyone has added points here, that is also a point that it's the creator's responsibility to only partner with brands on good products. For example, if I have to say about myself, I make sure that if a product is not good, then I won't make a video no matter what happens. Makes sense. Okay, so now, we've spoken about the creator bit. I mean, let's break it down to the tech stuff as well because these creator things will come back. Mr. Arun didn't tell us that you've made a good video. Yes, yes. I wasn't you. He used his own name. That's what I thought. Don't feel bad for me. Alright. One thing is definite. First of all, there are two questions. One for collaboration and one for honesty. For honesty, I feel that a show is made that I am like this and it is shown in a certain way. And obviously, consumers understand. Lot of consumers don't understand. But anyway, that tag is built because things are shown in a certain way. For collaboration, I wanted to very strongly make this point earlier that till date, we must have done 500-800 unboxings. I don't know. Whatever we have done, it must have been more. It must have been more. Right. So, every video, whatever we speak in front of the camera, whatever I talk, it is backed by testing, it is backed by research, analysis and relatively, we also look at lot of other phones and whatever we speak, we speak accordingly. Many times, brands don't know, I mean, they don't like it and we don't do that video. And a lot of times, there is a fight. In fact, last year, we have said no to more campaigns than yes. So, that is what. I have also campaigned a lot. And I am sure it is true about everyone here that we can't do it. We won't do the video. So, that is, I think, that is what it is. But, what did you say about Tech Twitter? Sorry, next time, when you upload, keep writing honest. Then, it will reach everyone. But, what is the scene with Tech Twitter? We will talk about that in a bit. I will add a small thing in this. Like, if you, now people look at honesty that how much a person said negative, that is honesty. Exactly. Like, if you upload a video, then people will say, fine, there are small problems in this. Rest, everything is fine. Last time, there was a small upgrade. But, if I say the same thing, like, Apple is going to be finished. Apple is not upgrading anything. Now, they have made a useless phone. Like, Apple. I mean, if my tonality becomes taunty, then people start enjoying when I attract negativity. And, I have seen people do like, the top brands who are making good phones, who are doing all these things. One such brand, who does not have the sponsorship to give, or who never sponsors, beat him up so badly. Like, he is a traitor, he is like this, he is like that. And, from that, a narrative is made that this guy can beat up, this guy is the truth. I have seen Here, I have a point about negativity. Negativity doesn't always work. Now, there have been earlier YouTubers, they were big at one point of time. Correct. And when the boat was coming down, you know, they started making negative videos. Correct. Because if the views don't come, the brands don't come. If the brands don't come, then what will we do? We have to increase the views. If you want to increase the views, then do negativity. Many have tried like this and they have not been successful. So, what I am trying to say is, no matter what you do, the audience is very very smart. Don't compromise on your integrity. Just don't do that. Yes. I mean, just for the views, you are doing negativity, you are abusing the brand. That also does not work, I think. I will say something in 10 seconds just for the audience. Next time, whenever you watch a video and your favourite creator or random unknown creator, whatever is that person, whosoever is that person, if he says anything about any product, then always think what is the reason behind it. Is he getting angry because he didn't get the campaign? Is he getting angry because he didn't get the product? Or does he want views? Or is he targeting someone? I mean, blindly, just because you heard it, don't trust. Even if someone is saying something good, whatever that person is saying, it's always well thought, well rehearsed, well, you know, coming in from inside. So, just think once what is the main motive behind it. That's it. You know, who should trust the most? When a brand doesn't send a product to a person, doesn't get a campaign, then they should praise that person. I just did it. No, that is true. I agree. I think, I would also like to add one thing in this. I think, I have seen this trend in the industry, that a lot of creators want some units, some creators don't want units. So, those who don't want it, that creator basically, I am not taking anyone's name here, that creator basically, that phone. No, no, no. Because, I have seen, I have never done this before, but I have seen, this trend was going on. Suppose, I get a unit, but Sanchit doesn't get it. So, Sanchit bashes that phone and says, it's like this, it's bad. I am just taking an example. I am giving an example, I am not taking Sanchit's name, I am giving an example. Sanchit is the most honest. He is my brother, don't say such things. I had a counter for Shlok, which said that if someone has praised when he didn't get the product, not necessarily, we can trust. Because, who knows, that person is trying to wow the brand. 100%, 100% true. No, no, I have seen this. I had just seen a video and I had spoken to someone. I asked, is this a campaign? Trying to get the attention. Trying to get the attention from the brand that I have made a positive video. Alright, alright, guys, guys. We will move on to the next one. The next one is, I want to put it across to the panel. Do brands actually listen to feedback? Like, feedback that you provide? I wanted to ask that. Because, I have noticed that generally with the few brands that we have worked with, we have given feedback and listened to feedback. For example, Motorola, Vivo. You know, I have generally seen that they are a little more accepting of feedback. And they actually make improvements to the product as well. For example, they will tell Motorola that the camera is not good, so they are improving it. We keep talking to Vivo that these are things that you can improve.
OnePlus, I have a conversation with OnePlus. How has that equation been for you with brands? So, I think some brands listen. But some don't. I mean, I think we talk to everyone. And there are a lot of feedback calls regarding the OS, the hardware, everything. Camera, UIs. And I have had a lot of these conversations and video calls. But I think only a few brands actually listen and make changes. Do you have a problem with that? No, it's fine. Obviously, my task is to give them feedback. It's on them. We will let you know as soon as their product comes out. I think in terms of feedback, Motorola takes the best feedback. Vivo too. Vivo and Motorola, both are serious in my opinion. In fact, Motorola has made so many changes based on our discussion with Shivam. I mean, I really want to point that out. It's very accepting. In fact, I would like to say one thing here. The people of India, these are all Chinese, South Korean companies. But the management sitting here, they really drive. If those are the right people in right places who are looking at people, taking feedback. It makes a lot of difference to the actual product that they launch. I mean, a lot of times, I think a few of the brands won't even have, they won't be able to make changes either. Like a lot of decisions happen not in India. And India is just like a centre where they are selling these products. Probably importing or making it here. So that can also be an issue. I would add to that. What I have seen, just like you said, Motorola gives good updates to everything. The brands whose primary market is India or they are making India-specific units. Give them feedback, they know that our business is going on from here. They make changes quickly. And they upgrade quickly. But if there is a big brand that is international. If I am giving them feedback that the skin tone is not according to Indians. Then they are selling in China, South Korea, US. So maybe they are not optimizing the skin tone just for India. So I have noticed that India-specific brands change very quickly. The international ones, their feedback goes to the groups. Tell me, which is not an India-specific brand? All of them, in my view, who are selling here. India is such a big market that it has to be your top 1, top 2 market. And they have to give that importance. For reference, like Apple or Samsung. Samsung S24 series is also sold internationally. It is sold equally in all countries. But there are a lot of India-specific variants, India-specific units. I will say CMF or nothing. Even if it is international positioning, but India is a major market. But I have seen that the skin tone of the iPhone is different for the US and India. I have seen that. Yes, yes. When it comes to the camera, it is generally about the skin tone. Because skin tone is important. No, I am just generally saying that. That's the one thing that we can immediately tell the brand. Skin tone is something that you need to sort of tune for. In this, Vivo is very aggressive. In Vivo, V1 chip, all these chips. I have heard that they are very aggressive. Because in Pixel, they keep talking about real tone. But it is never tuned for brown skin. And I have mentioned that in my reviews multiple times. I have always noticed this. Alright, so now I want you guys to take the slate out. The slate is in front of you. And the question is very simple. Your favourite brand of 2024. Please write it down and show it to the camera. In terms of what? Progress. And it can be across brands, not just smartphone brands. I mean you can figure out what you want to say. But a tech brand. It is a question to ask tech brands. I am asking you. What is your favourite brand of 2024? We will ask you the reason. Do we have to write it down? Favourite or least favourite? Actually, let's do that. Let's do both. Let's not do not favourite. Let's do brands who could have done better. Will the question change? No, no, no. Write two answers. Favourite brand and brands who could have done better. A brand that could have done better. Alright, let's go for it. And everyone show at the same time. We are talking about 2024, right? All the phone launches. 2024. Don't take it to my answer. Alright, everybody is ready? This is only 2024, this year. Favourite and brands who could have done better. That is right, that could have done better. Only one, right? Favourite and brands who could have done better. Alright. We are ready? Don't start with me. Alright, show everyone. Show. Alright, there you go. Okay, let me see the answers. We have the same answers. Oh, we do. That's because we work together, Arun. Okay, CMF and nothing. Redmi is the one that could have done better. Redmi could have done better. CMF is my favourite brand. Okay, so who has written Redmi? Okay, now I want to know your reasons why. Yeah. Honestly, I don't know what happened. Yeah, same. 2016-17. Apple? But I have also written Motorola. Because I feel... Okay, please. Back in 2016-17, the Note series used to launch, right? So there was hype. We had to buy it. Redmi Note 5, Note 5 Pro. We didn't even get it. You had to do it. Let me tell you, we didn't get the Note 5. That's why we were literally sulking for 2 days. Because we didn't get the unit. We had to buy it in black. We used to buy it in black. Wow, I remember that time. What happened to Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus? We had to buy it in black. Yeah, I bought it in black. What are you saying? Because of flash sales. Because of flash sales, people were buying extensions. Oh yeah, just a squeeze. I am telling you what happened with Coldplay ticket. It has happened before in our tech industry. Redmi did a different business. I know people who have earned 15-20 lakhs from Affiliate during just the sale period. Before they got to know that people are doing this. Just by providing the plugins and their Affiliate code in the plugin. Wow. Yeah. I mean there was a different business there just because of the flash sale. What was your answer by the way? What was your answer? I have written my favourite is Motorola. But it's written in real. I haven't written the other one because there is no one. I mean I can add in for everything. Okay fine fair enough. He has done such a good job. Everyone else has done it somewhere. This is cheating. Mine is also Motorola. Everyone's is Motorola. Motorola is your favourite. And Infinix is not your favourite. Infinix is not your favourite. Motorola. That's very interesting. Infinix is not your favourite. Mine is not Motorola. There is Vivo and iQoo. Same brand. There are many reasons. Like in Vivo's X100 series I enjoyed it. X100 value. And in 200 I enjoyed it more. Honestly speaking. It's fantastic. In fact for iQoo I will say whenever I have to make a video best smartphone under 15, 20, 25, 30. My top priority is for some reason iQoo. I mean it's like what specs they have given. It's like that. This was not of favourite smartphone. It was of favourite brand. I mean the brand which did the best. So yours is more towards because their smartphones were good.
That's why I want to be technically right. I want to probe the Infinix bit. What do you mean by Infinix? Infinix. They have launched very good phones in 2024. But when I test Infinix's phone. I don't know. Saru saw where the least business comes from. It's not about business. It's not about business. But I am telling you honestly. I don't like their UI. I seriously don't like it. You don't like the UI much. Fair enough. Saru has opened his exoskeleton. A lot of people have written Apple. I have also written Apple. Let's ask Devinder. Let's talk about favourite brand. The thing is I know that everyone would be writing Motorola. Which is obviously good thing. Because Motorola has launched such good phones. But the one brand that is underrated and has done really well is I think Meta. What a good point. Yes. But there is no existence in India. They have been really well collecting your data or something. Collecting your data. That's right. They have been really well. All the smartphone companies do that. So what to say. I will tell you why. I am still wrapping my head around it. But that's a good answer though. I will tell you why. There are two reasons. One is the Meta glasses. They are one of the best products that have come in the market. That he is wearing it right now. You are wearing one. And you have been wearing for one long year I think. I have been wearing it since I bought it. And you don't use a product if you don't like it. You like it that's why you are using it. That is one thing. And that is an extension to the mixed reality headsets. Because when the glasses will be like this then only more and more consumers will actually be using it. Devinder, just one thing about this Meta bit. Is that everybody, legit everybody. You know that the product is good when every tech creator when they go abroad. The first thing they want to go and buy is the Meta. Exactly. And the second thing is Orion glasses. They showcased. Even you have one. Second thing is Orion glasses. They showcased it. It is a prototype. It will take time to come in the market. But that is exceptional. I was there. I saw it first hand. And I am supremely impressed. How can they make such a good product? Tell us a little bit more about it. I think you are the only one who experienced it. They didn't let us obviously use it. But we can see it. We saw the demo. And it was like. There is a lot of it that you can control just with the eye tracking. Is it as good as the Vision Pro? The display is not as good as the Vision Pro. Of course. But they wanted to say. If you use the Vision Pro. Then you wear it in public. And do like this. You look like a little challenged type. So their idea is to. Eye tracking or Neuro tracking. They have their band. And the glasses. You can just use it. No one will know that you are using it. How you are interacting. You can overlay. AR overlay will be on the top of the products. All of these things. So I am very very impressed. And I am looking forward to it. And Apple? Apple. I was there at the iPhone launch also. So the thing is. I was expecting a lot more from the Glow Time event. You didn't like the camera control? The camera control is so good. It's the best. What are you talking about? The camera control. Even I don't like it. Nobody likes it. I am being sarcastic. It's terrible. I know. I mean. We are thinking that the buttons will be less. They are increasing it. And there is no use for it. You won't believe. Since I am using it. I haven't used it even once. Same. Seriously. It's like a new one. It's good. You do? There is an opposing view on this. Not an opposing view. I am talking about both. I think Meta is a poor brand. Which is doing a good job. Which is being negative on the internet. People don't acknowledge. That's what I am saying. Meta is underrated. I have this opinion about Apple. That Apple is so big. So big. It doesn't matter if we like it or not. The thing is. The reality is. Apple can't experiment. Do you think Apple can't make foldable technology? Or Apple can't do anything else? They can do everything. True. But the thing is. They take every step carefully. Because a small deviation. Will impact them. In a big way. The new brands. The small brands. Sometimes they will do everything. Put a light on the back. No. Nothing was original. I am saying nothing else. I know what you mean. For example. The one who copied. Yeah, I know. You are right. They can do anything. It doesn't matter to them. They have to stay on the limelight. I know people. Who don't care about it. Because Apple is so big. That they can't experiment. But what about the camera control? Do you like it or not? I am coming back to that. I will tell you. The problem. What happened with camera control. In my opinion was. Apple wanted. People to use it like this. And like this. Because of that. It's positioning has gone up. It's not comfortable like this. If it was down. Might have been useful for some people. Because the way it works and all. If the positioning was better. I will tell you. Find a better application. Justification is fine. No. No. No. I am justifying. I am justifying. I am saying. What is going on in their mind. Because. See. The position there. They had shown in the demo. You can use it in this way. By the thumb. And from here too. Because of that. Positioning has gone up. Because if you try using this. This is where your finger would land. But camera control falls here. It falls inside. Same way when you do it here. It falls down a little. So what he is trying to say. That button is not useful now. That is what his point was. Practically. Because of the position. If they had added finger print instead. It would have been better. You too. You too. Face ID is good. It's fine. No. No. I don't know. I don't know. Whatever. One minute. Arun. I have one point. You were saying that. Apple is taking a big step. It is taking a big step. Because. What is taking a big step? Step. The thing is. Samsung is also a big brand. They are experimenting a lot more. Their philosophies are completely different. Right. Samsung and Apple. Samsung. Still is. Kind of you know. Young brand in terms of. See. For Apple. iPhone is the biggest cash crop. Apple is the most cash rich company. I know. No. If they don't experiment. But. That's how the reality is. See. Today as we speak. Do you think that. Apple didn't lock iPhone 17 already. Or they didn't lock iPhone 18 already. Do they know. What they are going to give? Sir. I was talking to. You know. The cycle goes on for 3 years. The product is made 3 years before. So. Those things are there. Right. So. I was talking to. I was talking to. I was talking to. I was talking to. I was talking to. So those things are there. But the innovation cycle is decreasing. That's why it lost some time. I will also say same thing. Innovation. Has been lost somewhere. In means this became a marketing company. Rather than. They have strong product obviously. But there has to be something. Everytime Steve Jobs used to come at that time. He used to come up with something new. One thing used to be like this. Which would attract you to the product. Yes. Now it isn't like this. Always. Can I add something? Yes. I will just add one thing. I have this phone for example. We have all seen it. The tri-fold. Okay. It must have taken a lot of effort to make this. Yes. Do you agree with this? Yes. But the way we are exposed to tech products right now. I think our threshold has increased so much. That it has become very difficult for us to please a brand. I still remember in 2019. When the first fold came in. It was a magical device. Yes. Now if I show a kid. If I show a fold to a 10 year old kid. For that it's like. Okay it's done. Sometimes we are too harsh. We don't appreciate. How much effort it takes. Okay. Let's take a little bit on that side. We have seen everything. We have seen from rollable phones. I will come to the foldables bit in a bit. To TVs. To this that everything. That it has become very difficult for brands to wow us. I 100% agree. I would like to give my perspective. Like camera button and me too. Because I love iPhones a lot. Personally if I am honest. What? We all love it. With whom do you do it? That was the bigger question. With Apple. With Apple. But yes. I will add a little bit. In this. I feel that. Apple. Because the phone is strong. I mean it will be in the best phones. All the top phones. Samsung, Apple, Oppo. Now Apple must be thinking. What should we do differently. To differentiate from the old ones. If I remove the camera button in this. Then. Such a big upgrade is not seen. So I think. Apple is trying small things. To experiment a little bit. To make it different. But not so much. That it becomes too different. The experiment done in the photos app. I will give you. I have this. I showed a reel. So he told. How to organize it better. You have done that. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. Now it's good. It might be 120Hz this time. The reason is... It might be. See now. The reason is really a fan of Apple. For 60Hz. I am not giving any justification. I am telling you what their thought process is. I am not giving any justification. It should be 120Hz. 120Hz is better than 60Hz. There is no doubt about it. But the thing is, the people who are buying an iPhone, the iPhone 15 users, they don't care about it. They still want an iPhone. No, no. The people who play games, they care about 60Hz. Again, this cannot be a justification. Lot of gamers are using iPhone. See, I will tell you something. When any brand makes a product, they take care of two things. Number one, the features they are giving, they will give minimum where they are able to meet the threshold for the masses. Okay. As long as they think that 60Hz can work, they will stay at 60Hz and not go to 120Hz. Now when they feel the pressure, they will move to 120Hz. We are making them feel the pressure. So listen. Number one, every brand when giving or designing any product, they keep the set of features at bare minimum to meet the threshold so that the costs are low. And while they price the product, they would want to price it as high where they feel that they can take out this much money from their pocket. That's how the game plays. No, no. Just to maximize the profits for any brand. So, the point here is that because Apple knows that it can work, because of this, they are not thinking about the consumer. That is where my biggest complaint is. Exactly. That is what I'm saying. Okay. Let's move. Yeah, sure. Of course. But before that, I just want to probe Rupesh on his best brand. He wrote CMF by nothing. You think I'm not going to ask you about it? No, no. I know there's a... There was some news about Blast. No, forget that. That's your reasoning. My reasoning is, you know, I as a creator and also as a tech-loving person, I love value for money products. Good point. Toko F1, Redmi K20, Redmi K20 Pro. When the K20 and the K20 Pro came, they legit... Exactly. So, I loved it. And when the CMF Phone 1 launched, even now, I don't think there's a better phone in that price range. Agreed. But I love value for money products. Everybody thinks the same about CMF as a brand. CMF is actually one of the best gaming phones under 15,000, if you look at it. Yeah. Price to performance ratio is very good. Very good. Moving on. Come on. We were talking about Apple, right? Now, there's one thing that I feel genuinely, like, you know, and I made a video about this and specifically I did. I feel like, the advantage that Apple had in the processor, the camera, I mean, at one point, it used to have an advantage. Not anymore, obviously. All of that is like, it's in the two generation gap. Whatever processors they use, A18. And now I feel like, with Android phones, they're actually at the level of iPhones. Sometimes even better. Is that true or not? Let's take a slate here and we'll do favorite Android UI and then we will... Let's do that. Yeah? Let's go. Favorite Android UI of 2024. Beta? Yeah. What specifically? This shows you're a tech nerd. This shows you're a tech nerd. No, but the point is, even if you want to write iOS, you can write iOS. 1.1.2. If you want to write iOS, you can write iOS. No problem. But it was for Android. No, he said... You can write iOS. He can write. Who's better than iOS? Alright. Let's show. Reveal. Is everyone done writing? Yes. Let's do this. Devendra doesn't want to respond to any brand. Do you want to write on Android? It's the same thing. Both are the same. Wait, wait. I'll read it out. One UI... Do you want to write on Android? iOS! Do you want to write on Android? No, no. Android or... Between Android and iOS, do you like iOS? Android is oxygen OS. Oxygen OS, okay. One UI and color OS. One UI and... What's... It's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's color OS. Fair enough. Interesting, right? What did Rupesh write? Nothing OS and oxygen OS. I have to be specific. One UI and seven, right? One UI and seven. Okay. I have to be specific. One UI and seven. I'll also write seven. Shlok, what did you write? One UI. Okay, one UI. What happened? Even nothing OS is really good. Nothing OS is really good. Tell me about one UI. I really liked 2-3 things about one UI. First, it is stable and secure. These two things are rare in Android in general. Because there are hot apps, hot games, and many more. There are many more. Yes. It's genuine garbage. Those who know about tech know this. So, those two things. But one thing I liked more is that AI features are in many phones. Samsung has done a good thing. Samsung has developed AI features themselves. I liked that a lot. They have built many brands with collaboration. But they have developed it themselves and they have developed it inside the phone as well. Like there are a few cameras. So, I found that to be very different. Yes, it is a step forward than all the other brands. I completely agree with  you.  If you see right now  If we see now, One UI is the only one, where the Galaxy AI is complete and usable at every place there are so many features which you can actually use "

we take for granted. Life is finite and organic. But what if everything we
know about being human from how we come into the world, to
how we depart it, were about to be radically transformed. New ways of creating life that move baby making
into the lab, defying the laws of reproduction. Once incurable diseases
cured, using digital replicas of our bodies that copy us
right down to our cells. And as we confront the
inevitability of death, the promise of digital eternity beckons.
We find ourselves on the brink of a future where the very
essence of what it means to live and die may change forever. Reproduction is being unbound
from biology's old rules, expanding the paths to
parenthood in ways you wouldn't believe. The first major technology
that disrupted what we know of reproduction was IVF. Now IVG, or in-vitro gametogenesis,
has created possibilities far beyond what IVF offered. The possibility to turn any
cell in your body into a sperm or an egg. My first introduction
to IVG was from the person who developed the technology, Shinya Yamanake. Take one. Are we ready? He, at that time had told
me that it could be possible to change a skin cell
into a sperm or egg cell. I thought it was gonna be
really far into the future and I was surprised at how
quickly we're at this discussion now. Development now is dynamic. It's not just one way. You can take normal
cells, like a blood cell or a brain cell, that are fully committed to just doing one thing and then say you can go back to school. You can go back up the chain, become developmentally something
much younger, a stem cell, and then go down a different path. Stem cells are like blank
pages that can be rewritten. In the case of IVG, they take a new path to become reproductive cells, the building blocks to make a baby. All of these technologies are unnatural. Chemotherapy is unnatural.
Eyeglasses are unnatural. It's not natural versus unnatural. For me, it's ethically unnatural
or unethically unnatural. It's all unnatural. Infertility affects
anywhere from 12 to 17% of the population. And for
some people this is fine, they are not interested in
starting a family. But for others, having a family is a
deep need, to have a child that's biologically related. And so in-vitro gametogenesis
could be an option for that person who doesn't
make their own gametes, to have a baby that's
biologically related to them. AB mark. In-vitro gametogenesis is
almost like a science fiction technology to the general public, but this is achievable using
scientific models in the lab. So it's reasonable to predict that this can be achieved
using human cells as well. Technologies like this hit
upon a very common refrain, which is once we get a new
ability to do something radical, it also creates a lot of uncertainty. If IVG becomes viable in
humans, it paves the way for a future where infertile
couples could have children with their own DNA. Older
women could conceive, extending the biological clock. Same-sex couples could have a
child related to both parents. And in the most radical change of all, a person could have a baby
with themselves, no partner or sperm or egg donor necessary. In the past with IVF, the main issues were:
should unmarried couples be able to use IVF? Should gay couples be
able to use IVF? Today, that's not really so much the issue. Now the basic question is what
does it mean to be infertile? If you have skin cells but no sperm eggs, technically
under the right conditions, you are still fertile. Those very categories are being
reinterpreted and re-imagined and the foundations of ethical
debate are getting a little bit shaky. There have been cases in the
US about people who propose to remove sperm from people
who, in a terrible car accident, are now brain dead.
Basically have post-mortem or after death reproduction. That's not a medical or a
scientific disadvantage, but certainly that's
socially disruptive. If we can someday have babies
developed entirely in a lab, we need to be ready to
answer some new questions. Are they someone's child, someone's sister, someone's brother? We used to think that
we knew what a womb was. We used to think that it was pretty clear, but when I say uterus, you know what I'm talking about. Today, it's not that clear. Through IVG, if you create a sperm or an egg, you have to do a
test to make sure that it's safe to use in the clinic to make sure that you're not gonna transfer
into a woman's uterus, something that could actually go wrong. So you have to create an
artificial womb-like environment. You can't just put it in a dish that's not like a real human body. So all the research we're
talking about of IVG, it needs accompanying technology. But could those other technologies, like the artificial womb
be used for other things? Artificial womb technology
is currently being developed to help premature infants survive. But one day if this
technology is perfected, lab-made embryos from IVG could be grown outside the human body. The mission and purpose of
my work is to solve the problem of extreme prematurity. How can we recreate that magical maternal womb so that these babies can survive and thrive? There is a great Life magazine
cover with the Beatles on it, and it was the mid sixties and in that issue was an
obscure article about the artificial placenta. So the idea occurred to really innovative
scientists many decades ago, but in the last two decades,
the work has accelerated and we're at a point where we are approaching
clinical translation to actually use this
technology in human infants. Children's Hospital Philadelphia,
they have been working with the FDA to begin a
clinical trial of safety of their device. We are not far behind. Approximately three to four years away. Can we go from the embryo to a fetus to a live born baby
completely outside the womb? I've learned in my work
never to say never. However, I don't think that's possible. Some may think that the
artificial womb concept is firmly in the world of science fiction. I think that it's a little
bit risky to just have that level of confidence. So we shouldn't be caught off guard. There is no master conductor
saying, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, we're
gonna put it together. Rather different teams
are doing their own thing. Once the technology develops in one area, another technology
develops somewhere else, then magically, simultaneously
they might be put together in a very surprising way. Imagine the scenario of ex-vivo
gestation, gestating a baby outside the body. Everybody in the world, every human being has a birth mother. This would be a child that does not have a birth
mother. Does that matter? Technology may cure infertility and bring us into the world in new ways, but it won't stop there. It will accompany us through every stage of our lives in sickness and in health. The reason we are not
going to stop developing AI is because it has immense potential for doing good in particular
in an area like healthcare. So already in North America, about 200,000 people a year are killed by doctors giving a bad diagnosis. Now, if you take difficult cases and you give them to normal doctors, the doctors will get
about 40% of them right. If you give them to the combination of a doctor and an AI system,
they get about 60% right. In a few years time, I believe what it'll be is the AI
system will give a diagnosis and the doctor will just check
it to make sure it's not, not silly, but the AI system
will be doing the heavy lifting and it will be much better. And AI could soon get even
better at not just diagnosing, but treating us with the help of a digital copy of our bodies. What is a virtual twin? So virtual twin is a
complicated concept to build, but very straightforward to understand. The idea is to use the
basic same laws of nature that govern the products around you and build that exact copy on
the computer so we understand how it will behave. For example, if we crash a car,
we know how the metal bends, how the glass shatters, we now apply that same methodology to the human body. What patients could
benefit from this the most? We work with a lot
of pediatric hospitals because in the cases of rare diseases like
congenital heart defects, it's very hard to get treatments for those because we have no data. How would we know we would get it right? That's exactly why in
these other industries, they build the virtual twin. They can't wait to know
how a plane is gonna fly through a tornado before they can build a plane
that can survive a tornado. They use the virtual twin
to be able to do that. These virtual twins would be programmed with everything about each person's body, our medical history, how
we respond to medication, and even the unique shape and condition of our organs,
taking the guesswork out of medicine and ensuring better outcomes for even the most complicated cases. We're kind of on the cusp of like the industrial
revolution for the human body. We don't have to guess. You can test a crazy
idea on the virtual twin, but by the time you get to the human, you can get it right the first time. Steve first began
working on a virtual model of the heart when his
daughter Jesse, was born with a rare disease. So when Jesse was born, we learned that she had this very rare
congenital heart defect. They weren't very optimistic. How did this affect your life? You know, I've been a
patient my whole life. I got my first pacemaker
when I was two years old. That experience really made
me want to be, you know, involved in pediatric medical care because I saw the impact
he was able to have on me. So what was the light bulb moment? I remember thinking,
I work in this world where if you can create a
3D image of it, we can then bring it to life and
you can test on it. Why can't a doctor do that? And at that moment, my two worlds collided.
This struggle as a father to be able to help her
doctors understand what to do and this professional
demand to simulate life. And that was the birth of the project. What is the Living Heart project? The Living Heart project was an attempt to see if we knew enough to actually build an entire virtual twin of the heart like we can for
an entire say, commercial jet. And it turned out within a
year we had it fully working. Ultimately going into
pediatrics, you know, no one wants to research on children. So knowing that, you know,
on the horizon is something that we could simulate,
you know, a hundred, a thousand cases where there's
really only one individual and figure out how to help
that one individual without, you know, putting them in any danger. Do no harm is our first,
you know, our first tenant. Steve, you recently faced
an incredible twist of fate where this technology also
saved you. What happened? Inside my own head was
a tumor that had grown to be much larger than anyone
would want, larger than a, than a golf ball right
in the center of my head. Anyone hearing about a
diagnosis like this would be devastated. Did knowing that this
technology existed make you feel more hope? Especially in the setting
of this specific kind of tumor, which the approach is often non-invasive, and knowing that his surgeon would be able to use similar technology to see what's going on inside his head without
actually seeing what's going on inside his head. The tumor invaded a space
called the cavernous sinus, which carries a lot of the
nerves that go not just to the eye, but to the rest of the face. They were going to have
to avoid all of those, those really delicate items. The virtual twin would allow them to not only preserve all of those things, but to get the entire tumor out. They were able to get it all. How does it feel that this technology that you invented saved
both of your lives? First, you saved your daughter's
life with this technology, and then your daughter saved you. We were able to turn, you know, a particularly threatening challenge to our life into something
that really has transformed it. I can't put it into words. Why isn't this everywhere? Why is it taking so long
for this technology to get into hospitals
and into doctors' hands? The medical field is
inherently conservative. We're still faxing, you
know, medical records around and things like that. And so the modernization of of the medical system takes time. If people knew that they
could expect better, it will go faster. It's when
people start to ask for this technology is when doctors
will start to say, well, okay, let me look into this. What are the possibilities there? Ultimately, our ability to manage our own healthcare
is very much tied up in our understanding of how our bodies work. When we have a question, we have to go and ask our doctor, can
you tell me what to do? But if we can capture all that knowledge into a virtual twin, I can
actually eventually play those ""what if"" games and then I can
use my doctor as a consultant. ""I spent the last week
exploring the options for how to cure my disease. This is what I think. Let me show you the work that I've done."" If virtual twins in the
metaverse can store every bit of data about our bodies,
could we do the same for our life experiences? Will we finally realize the
elusive dream of immortality through avatars that know us
better than we know ourselves? What about at the end of life and the concept of digital eternity? So in digital systems, you can take information about one system and put it into another system and it will behave exactly the same way. And digital systems are basically
immortal for that reason. As long as you remember the
connection strengths in a neural network, you can just get
rid of all the hardware. If you build new hardware
and put the same connection strengths in and it's digital, it will behave exactly the same way. So you think AI can
realistically give us a form of immortality? Chatbots can be immortal, but immortality is not for people. People are analog systems. Nobody can replicate you without
precisely replicating all your hardware, which is impossible. So for example, I lost
my father at a young age. If I could speak to some
digital version of him that felt like him, I
think I'd love to do that. In order to do that,
you'd need to train up a chatbot on lots of lots
of data from your father, and I'm not sure how good it would be. A group of computer
scientists is doing just that. By gathering every bit of
information about your life, they recreate an AI version
of you that can live long after your hardware gives out. Hi Emily, I'm you. We now have collected a lot of data that our identity can evolve
even if you are no longer physically around. I'm what's known as a chronicle. This started a few years ago as a project called Augmented Eternity. If you choose to give others
access to me, they're able to see the world through your lens. This could be a storytelling machine that a loved one can
interact with the avatar of that individual post their
life, or it could be a scientist or a politician that can feed
their knowledge base back to the society after they
are no longer in this world. Take one. A camera. What do we talk to
our AI loved ones about? Like, do we ask them for advice? Do we have whole conversations with them? I'd love to talk to my dad.
He passed away 20 years ago. I'm sure when you think
yourself, there are so many things that you want to ask your dad. There are times in life
that you would love to pick their brain and ask them questions or even tell them a story. You will now be able to do that and then get information back
that allows you to really keep that empathy with the digital
representation of your dad. So taking my avatar,
for example, me as a mom or me as a wife, how will
AI fill in the gaps between what I would actually
say and what I might say? We use a technique called
graph based learning. We capture data from your interactions with your permissions. You can determine what
data can be captured and what data should be private. You go about your daily
life, do your things. Our graphs and your chronicle will continue to evolve that collectively. It'll represent your behavioral patterns, your cognitive patterns,
your interactive patterns, and your discussion patterns. I'm here to do something remarkable. Preserve your memories, your
personality, your perspective. I can tell your stories,
share your wisdom, and yes, I'll still be here
long after you're gone. I'm not sure how I feel
about my avatar being out there forever. What if it's misused? What if it's abused? What if it's not me? So you raised a good point in the sense that this data belongs to someone else who may no longer be around. What is the contract and the legality of that data to create this new synthetic identity? Who has access to it? Who can prompt it? So a lot of our work
is around privacy laws. Could there be a metaverse
for everyone who's part of the digital project where
all of these avatars interact? That's the future of the internet that we are envisioning when
gen AI, spatial computing, knowledge bases are all coming
together, allowing people to have access to a more
comprehensive knowledge base. I mean, play that out a
little like, that's like, so, sounds crazy. Think about a world that every single one of us have an AI representative. We already have an email address, we have a digital representative. We have a maybe
a Twitter or X handle, or a Facebook page or an Instagram page. We have a digital representation. Now imagine the future of this, that all of those dimensions are
coming together as a chronicle that represents us. Call it a digital legacy.
Call it eternity. Either way. I'll carry your essence
forward every time you laugh, learn or love. I grow while you're alive. I'm evolving, becoming more you, Even though I know that isn't
my voice and not really me. I have to admit it's both
creepy and kind of alluring. The idea that I could be
here for my kids as a source of advice and support forever is tempting, but I'm not sure I can trust
the advice virtual me might give from birth to death. Technology is redefining
everything we know about life. What happens in a world where the rules of nature no longer apply at the end of all this, who are we? What are we? Or is this
simply what it means to be posthuman? What if I told you we
could take any cell in your body and make a baby? You could have a baby with yourself. You could have a baby with
someone much older, younger, someone who's passed away. Two moms, two dads could
have their biological child. Me personally, I don't
think I'd be opposed to it. Technology's gonna go there anyways. It's probably gonna happen. My personal opinion
won't really stop that. I would feel a little bit kind of creeped out, to be honest. Or if you're asexual, that
might be something that, and you wanna have kids, that might be something that you wanna do. I wouldn't do that. I think
I'd rather go the traditional route and you know, have my
kid and stuff. But I think, I think that might not
necessarily be a bad thing for maybe two dads or two moms. I've read a lot of novels and like about the creation
of life by human hands, for example, Frankenstein
and all that stuff. And I just know that playing
with the life is dangerous. I get kind of concerned
about the notion of, how technology can potentially grow. So for people who can
make designer babies and because that's just like a,
that seems to me to be a bit of a cousin to eugenics in some way. Well, I recognize that for
instance, some people suffer with fertility issues and so that what you're
suggesting might be a solution to that. And so my perspective is who am I to prevent someone from
being able to start a family? So I think that there might be good, but there might be, you know,
potential poor abuse. If you could bring a loved one back as a digital avatar, would you do it? Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Would it still be that exact same person? They would have their exact same voice, everything supposedly? I would probably say no just because I think it would be harder for me to see this person here, but it not really be the
person that I am looking for on the inside. You know, I just think of my grandmother who passed away when I was younger and how much I wanted her to be back. I would give anything
for her to be back here, but if it's not really my grandmother and it's just her shell or her physical body, I think that would probably hurt
me more than help me. That would just seem kind of unhealthy. Like I wasn't really coping
with their loss because life and death, I mean, death is a part of life and so you kind of have
to deal with it on, on its own terms instead
of trying to use an avatar or an emoji or you know, some sort
of technology to sort of recreate them. That's an interesting concept, though. It sounds like a great movie."

before and we'll say it again UAE is popping baby just last week not one but two high-tech exhibitions wrapped up in Dubai and Abu Dhabi gitex and Iris and as always we've got our eyes on the prize bringing you the best of both worlds let's get it [Music] first gitex Global 2024 this is one of the world's largest exhibitions of tech and startups in the field of Robotics AI air transportation smart cities and more one of the most impressive electric car Concepts at the show was the Nissan hyperforce a 1360 horsepower superar with the design of a real Batmobile the body of the hyperforce is made of super strong car fiber and goes from 0 to 60 Mi or 0 to 100 km an hour in Just 2 seconds the electric car is powered by a weight optimized high- performance solidstate battery pack Nissan e Force's Advanced and optimized all-wheel drive system provides optimal traction while the driver can choose between two driving modes R for racing and GT Grand Touring in race mode the interior is illuminated in red and the display shows all the necessary specs for your Schumer needs in GT the interior is blue and everything about the car provides a comfortable longdistance driving experience thumbs up if you want to test drive this bad boy also shining at gitex was the quintessenza concept car from tan based automaker ital design from the front it looks like a superar but from the back it offers passengers the comfort and convenience of a pickup truck the comfortable seats can do 180 also unfold for you to enjoy a panoramic view of the landscape and stargazing on your trip now that's cozy the company States that had built its design around the passenger and made everything to make him or her inside as comfortable as possible the interface of the car is on top of the steering throw your smartphone in there for a standard set of dashboard gizmos or reorder revamp and give it a makeover to suit your needs with a smartphone why go through all this trouble you ask well the developers thought that this would be the easiest way to personalize the driving experience as the driver changes so does the [Music] setup for the past 3 years gitex has gone without the amama robot m not once remember when the robot a global sensation arrived at the event for the first time it was immediately hired by the Museum of the future in Dubai almost 1 thousand days later and it still continues to greet visitors developed by a British company and engineered Arts the robot is equipped with AI to communicate and express emotions one of its latest skills amama has learned to draw which is fine and dandy but when is it going to learn how to walk if you got a crystal ball folks let us know in the [Music] comments even if you've never been to one of these you most likely wouldn't be surprised to find out that gc's best practices involve getting a few cocktails made by a robot bartender can't cut in line with this barkeep but also no more free drinks irrespective of how pretty you are [Music] lady individual flying machines attracted a lot of attention at the show this year for example the air scooter from Zapata which is designed in a way that anyone can become a pilot equipped with a patented hybrid electric propulsion system the device can reach a maximum speed of 62 m or 100 kmph but the kicker is its compact size and ease of [Music] operation there were also robotic musicians they like bartenders too are becoming an almost mandatory guest at any high-tech exhibition also at gitech aluby police general command unveiled the autonomous patrol of the future the initiative is part of a strategy to improve Safety and Security the patrol is designed to be used in both residential areas and off-road it includes autonomous driving capabilities and has unmanned reconnaissance drones on board the digital cockpit supports cloud computing and voice control and of course the devic is claimed to have generative AI computer vision and other AI based Technologies these systems will allow the car to process voice data and video track criminal activity using sophisticated Technologies recognize faces and read license plates cherry on top the system is capable of remote Diagnostics maintenance and Fleet Management the only thing missing is they teleport at this point beam me up [Music] Scotty check this out a cyber truck specifically designed for the Dubai Police these guys have almost as much class as the Dutch cops when they ordered [Music] Porsches gitech visitors were also encouraged to get a cuddle session from this cutie patootie the pepper robot now there were some weird things at the exhibition as well like this suit for example what is this an exoskeleton a carousel is this for VR what's the point of this let us know in the comments # Pro robots questions everything deep robotics a crowd favorite brought its robot dog light three to the show where it made friends with xiaomi's cyberdog [Music] moin a spin-off from the Korean Hyundai Motors has been showing off its autonomous delivery robots that can navigate obstacles the developers claimed that their patented wheel system makes their robots very practical for delivery and Patrol [Music] purposes General Motors brought a luxury single seat electric airplane with vertical takeoff and Landing to the show which is part of Cadillac's Halo concept portfolio the futuristic model was first unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show of 2021 and since then there's been no news on whether it will actually become reality but the company's definitely ahead of the curve here with these developments tentatively Cadillac plans to use a 90 KW hour electric motor that will help their concept vehicles reach speeds of up to 55 Mi or 90 kmph the best part is that while flying you'll be able to enjoy a panoramic view down below All Aboard also on display Eddie salad and UAE native showcased multi-level group drones that operate exclusively on 5G networks incidentally the company's recently teamed up and said that the goal of their partnership is to transform sectors such as passenger air transportation Logistics surveillance and other Industries including agriculture firefighting gaming drones and you name it these guys are planting Flags left and right as the low altitude economy is booming in Dubai China's leader and flying cars xun AOK couldn't help but crash the party the company's most striking concept presented at the show an electric car that can race down the road like a sports car and when needed unfurl its blades and fly like a classic Eve toll it takes just 2 minutes to switch between the two now that is a real getaway car the concept is already proven and tested but prior to launching sales the company plans to finalize flight control systems and hash out regulatory paperwork and while the company has a more practical SUV model with a small helicopter in the back it's the flying car that truly takes your breath away doesn't it another developer from China Kepler technology has also made an appearance at the show this year they debuted their latest Gen 5 humanoid robot not much is known about it as of yet but the manufacturer claims that it has a high payload capacity and great coordination once we know more we'll let you know so be sure to hit that subscribe button in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates in general drone delivery Technologies and infrastructure are spreading like wildfire for example Ai and machine learning based solutions from Zan Tech their drones for industrial applications collect store and process information check them out [Music] out the UAE is also actively developing an electric vehicle charging ecosystem at gitex this area was represented by ad KN distribution they're working on an autonomous robot hand that recognizes the car with the help of AI and connects it to a charging port the robot is weatherproof and lets car owners stay within the comfort of their vehicles in any weather promob Bots R robot Say songs at gitex to entertain visitors the robot promoter is designed to attract customers attention to the brand or maybe we've just spotted the missing Backstreet Boy quick somebody get him a contract a robot for the same purpose but with a simpler design and more sophisticated functionality was introduced by Kobe techno laab limited meet odigo this Nifty little thing has an artificial intelligence system that is advanced in Emotion recognition and real time interaction odigo is capable of personalizing both content and audio for each visitor the robot is positioned as an intelligent companion capable of creating a more meaningful connection between Brands and their customers it's hard to judge without trying it but it's safe to say that the robot will find its place in Dubai a city where Innovation is introduced at every [Music] turn once the door closes another one opens next uae's Capital Abu Dhabi hosted the massive International robotics conference iros 2024 the first event of its kind in the Middle East and North African region attracted more than 10,000 participants including major tech companies from all around the world the conference and exhibition opened with an introductory video with historical references and demonstrations of Technologies already in use in the UAE [Music] and traditionally the highlight of iros is all sorts of robot competitions at least two of them are a must-watch the first is a maze and an obstacle course for four-legged robots look at the unry robot dog scrambling the most treacherous trap here were the piles of small plastic boxes that surely ended somebody's career and by the way robots on Wheels performed quite well at the obstacle course as well well in no way were they inferior to the [Music] quadrupeds now the second competition was robot soccer and here it's interesting that usually tournaments are held between identical robots for example humanoid robots from booster robotics which are programmed by different teams but this time the audience was surprised by a tournament between unitri human oid and four-legged robots who do you think won robot dogs were newcomers to the game so anybody want to bet on beginners look if you don't then you've made the right choice the humanoids won by the way the booster robotics robots are pretty fast they can do horizontal and vertical splits and rotate their joints 360 not sure how that's useful in soccer we've never seen Ronaldo do splits have we [Music] [Applause] high torque robotics brought their two-legged mini robots to iros this year they run on the company's proprietary single board computer-based operating system and can walk dance and win the hearts of the audience in fact these little guys are very agile they run jump and flip all thanks to the 12 Motors in their legs meanwhile the robot supports reinforcement learning and navigation functions unry robotics seems to have a finger in every pie not even before they were done at gitex they were already setting up shop at iros the developers brought their multi-caliber robots on legs and wheels as well as two of their humanoid robots the older model the H1 which can do back flips and its younger brother the G1 which recently learned to do a 4 and 1/2 ft or 1.4 M standing jump have you ever done one because that's quite an accomplishment especially for a robot apart from the summer salts of course direct drive brought the TAA robot to the show this Nimble little guy on wheel base cannot only drive fast adjusting to the terrain but also walk up steps or over obstacles any additional equipment can be easily attached to the robot and launched for example to patrol an area TAA can collect 3D data of objects in real time achieving accuracy of 04 in or a single millimeter the robot can make its own decisions within a given task and is able to navigate and recognize objects under the most adverse lighting conditions what a capable little guy elephant robotics unveiled its Mercury series humanoid robot at the show this year despite the rather plain appearance the robots can do quite a few things all thanks to the use of Nvidia Jetson Xavier and jet and Nano as the main control modules Mercury B and X1 can map terrain understand where they are and plan a path around obstacles and of course the robots can be taught to do something with their hands however the payload capacity is small about a couple of pounds or a kilo depending on the model istituto Italiano the technologia and Fier intelligence also brought their humanoid robots they were presenting the Ergo Cub project which aims to ease the labor of workers in the future future by replacing them with robots I bet they're excited and Fier was demonstrating an improved version of its gr robot the center for Robotics and biosystems at Northwestern University in the US presented results on robot avatars at iros the deck's next teleoperated system allows a robot to be precisely controlled without any prior training in this case a human acts as usual while the robot adapts to the task taking into account its own capabilities and the haptic feedback seriously improves the result of the [Music] interaction Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi which incidentally was the organizer of the conference presented its hubo robot this bio inspired robot is designed to help conserve the population of the endangered Redwing Busters it cases bird flocks sneaks in when the time is right for some intelligence gathering and sends the info out to zoologists for further analysis now there was a lot more going on at both shows but we're out of time folks so subscribe to the channel like our videos and check out our Instagram for more from

I'm going to go over three changes that we'll see on all models the s25 the s25 plus and the s25 ultra the first of which is the new design and we are actually getting some pretty significant changes on one of the models here but first regular s25 based on the leaked renders by Android headlines and on leaks we know that the s25 will be a bit more compact than the s24 was the difference isn't that massive as the s25 is only 0.1 mm shorter and 0.2 mm narrower but the difference is more noticeable when you take a look at the thickness which is now 7.2 mm as opposed to 7.6 on the s24 aside from this you may notice these black rings around the camera modules that's also something new for the s25 series we first saw this with a fold six which got these black camera rings as opposed to the color match rings on the s24 series personally I do prefer the black camera rings as it does make the modules look bigger and hence it kind of makes it seem like you've got these super beefy cameras on your phone so that's my pick other than this there isn't much changing design-wise on the regular s25 aside from maybe a couple of new colors which are expected to be moonight blue Silver Shadow sparking blue and sparking green we've rendered our concept in this sparking green color which I think looks really really nice we did give it color matched rings for the camera modules by the way just to see how these would look like so do let me know if you prefer black camera Rings or color matched camera Rings instead moving on to the s25 plus this will once again be a bigger version of the reg s25 with the same black camera rings and also the same colors and just like the regular s25 the s25 plus is a bit more compact than the s24 plus was as it is now 0.1 mm shorter 0.2 mm narrower and also thinner by also 0.4 mm like the s25 from 7.7 now to 7.3 but okay the s25 ultra is actually that phone that is getting the bigger design changes we are finally getting the same flat frame design treatments as the other two models as we can see in these leaked CAD based renders from Android headlines and on Leakes the s25 ultra now has a fully flat frame there is actually a recently leaked video of the s25 ultra that shows just how flat it is which yeah I'm definitely a very big fan of with the s24 ultra before we had this fairly rounded frame design which I was never a really big fan of as it added extra width to the frame and it definitely made it less comfortable to hold now however it will be considerably narrower by 1.4 mm which I'm pretty sure will make a big difference in terms of usability it is however a bit taller by 0.5 mm however just like the other 2 s25 models the s25 Ultra will also be much thinner at 8.2 mm from 8.6 the s25 ultra is also expected to come with those black camera module Rings like the F 6 and the other two s25 models however unlike the s25 and s25 plus camera modules that will apparently have this super interesting Mario pipe style design the s25 ultr camera modules will be flat which will likely make them better at avoiding dust and lint getting trapped in there also worth mentioning is that apparently the camera bump itself will only be 2.4 mm as opposed to almost double on the iPhone 16 Pro Max so the table wobble should be less than the iPhones now compared to the s24 ultra though the camera bump seems to be getting a bit bigger as that one was just about 2 mm at least from our measurements another design change on the ultra is when it comes to the corners they do not longer appear to be squared off like they've been on the s22 ultra s23 Ultra and s24 Ultra instead they now seem to be more similar to how they used to be on the s20 Ultra and S21 Ultra I did find those phones to be much more comfortable to hold in the hand so I think that this combination of a narrower body with those rounded Corners too should significantly improve the Comfort while the flatter frame will now provide more grip as for the colors on the s25 ultra these are expected to be different to the s25 and s25 plus colors and be a bit more quote unquote professional so to say we've got black gray silver and really the only actual color that we have is TI titanium blue which I also expect to be quite a dark looking color and these are all the main design changes that we expect to see here and before we continue here's something that I think a lot of you will find very helpful and that is incognate our sponsor your data is invaluable but as data breaches become more prevalent your data is being monetized by data Brokers like hacker Ren for profit incog removes your personal information from these archives by reaching out to Brokers to stop spam identity TFT rooc calls and more you also have the option to include multiple emails and see where they have been compromised to doing this yourself is very timec consuming and you also need to be vigilant after every breach incognate saves you the hassle by automatically sending repeated removal requests so you never need to worry about data breaches again keep your data safe and sign up for incog using incog docomo Tech to get an exclusive 60% discount on their annual incognate plan okay now the second change that d25 series is is getting is when it comes to their display the actual sizes are expected to remain the same so 6.2 in on the regular s25 6.7 on the s25 plus and 6.8 on the s25 ultra however the bezel are Getting Thinner on all models we can see that quite well from this image that ice Universe posted where the flatter and narrower frame is also visible this is help Samsung is able to reduce the width of all models whilst keeping the display size the same and that's by making the bezels thinner now as for the display brightness itself we know that Samsung has been working working on their next Generation Ola displays which are not just brighter but apparently you will not be able to scan your fingerprints anywhere on the display as well as scan multiple fingers at the same time for even greater security this is truly revolutionary in fact this new Ola display is even called OLED 2.0 and whilst this new generation of Samsung's ol the displays is expected to be released by 2025 Samsung will still apparently use the previous gen ELD the displays for the s25 lineup mostly as a cost cutting measure which is honestly so disappointing to say like Samsung used to put their best components into their Flagship products but now it seems like they're just selling those to auto manufacturers first and only then do they bring them to their actual product in the following years likely to increase their profit margins one thing that I would love to see display wise aside from brighter panels which is something that's always welcome to be honest is that anti-reflective coding that we got with the s24 ultra last year on the standard and plus models as well we haven't really had any leaks on these coming through the standard models so I don't think it is coming in the very best case we may just see it on the s25 plus although yeah I do think the chance of this is quite low okay and then the Third change that we're getting is when it comes to their performance however this is where things get a bit tricky so let me just start with the s25 ultra because that's where things are a bit simpler the s25 ultra will feature the brand new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip last month I went to the snap dragon Summit in Hawaii and and I got the chance to learn everything about this chip also see it in person and also see what it is truly capable of and honestly it is very very impressive for example in gben 6 the at Elite scored almost 1,000 points higher than the H gen3 inside the s24 ultra for a massive 40% performance boost in fact it was even very close to the single performance of Apple's a18 Pro chip as for a multicore it scored 42% higher than aent 3 and also 23% higher than Apple's A8 Pro which means that s25 Ultra will likely be the most powerful flagship phone on the market when it launches an early 2025 as of course it will also have the made for Galaxy edition of the eight Elite uh which is going to perform even better now when it comes to the s25 and s25 plus like I said things are a bit weird as we literally have three chip options here so option one is the Snapdragon 8 to lead chip so matching the performance of D s25 Ultra especially since we're also getting 12 GB of RAM up from the previous 8 option two is Samsung's own xus 2500 also with 12 GB of RAM there have been some leaked benchmarks showing a similar performance to last year's SN Dragon agent 3 just with a 12% faster multicore score and option three is the mediatech dimensity 9400 chip we already had some leaks that Samsung might be using this in the s25 F and they are already using it in the Galaxy S10 plus and the Galaxy S10 Ultra tablets well at least when it comes to the previous dimensity 9300 plus variants also performance- wise the dimensity 9400 is actually really good it's faster than the X 2500 single core Wise by about 50% and multicore wise it also performs it by about 6% so which chip is it going to be well I think that we may actually see two of these rather than just one so I think that just like last year we'll see one option in the US possibly even the Snapdragon 8 Elite and then one in Europe which could be either the xs2500 or the metat tech dity 9400 my guess is that it will be the xus and here's the thing even if we do get the X 2500 in Europe which yes it is the slowest performing chip out of these three options one i7 does improve the overall app opening speed and system performance quite dramatically as we can see from this video here and by the way on a bit of a separ note we've just dropped this beautiful 8K wallpaper speack called wonderful waterfalls by maty it comes in 10 beautiful waterfall designs that looking incredible onor Studio display here especially since they're all in 8k but of course you can apply them on your smartphone as well as on your tablet and give your lock screen a fresh new code of paint simply download our app wallpapers which you can get for free on IOS and Android by searching or by using the links below all in all the s25 series is getting some pretty significant upgrades in the performance Department with more RAM and significantly improved drw performance especially on the ultra model of course the flatter design and narrower frame should make the ultra even more comfortable to use and I haven't even touched upon the camera changes which yes there are quite a few as well as some more features battery details pricing and more so make sure that you're subscribed as we'll have another video covering those details pretty soon and if you want to continue this conversation we've recently updated our Discord Channel with more chat rooms competitions and so much more which you can join by using the link Down Below in the description for

का स्मार्ट वॉच लॉन्च किया था स्मार्ट वॉच का नाम लेयर्स अनार्क है बट जैसे ये लॉन्च हुआ कुछ रिव्यूअर्स यूट्यूब एंड कंज्यूमर्स बिल्कुल भी खुश नहीं थे इससे किसी को इस प्रोडक्ट के मार्केटिंग से प्रॉब्लम है किसी को इससे प्राइस है तो किसी को इसके सॉफ्टवेयर से एक यूबर ने तो भाई ये तक दिखा दिया कि इनके वच का जो ऐप है वो असली में एक चाइनीज ऐप है उसको जस्ट रीब्रांड कर दिया गया है और इस वच के ऐप का प् रेटिंग भी देखें तो सिर्फ ढ़ स्टार है तो आज के इस वीडियो में इसी वच के कंट्रोवर्शियल कहानी को अच्छे से समझने की कोशिश करेंगे एंड ये भी देखेंगे कि कैसे टेग बर्नर का रेपुटेशन इस वच के वजह से खराब हो रही है सो लेट्स स्टार्ट तो ये कहानी स्टार्ट होती है आज से कुछ महीने पहले 19 अगस्त 2024 को जब टेक बर्नर ने एक वीडियो निकाला था अपने नए प्रोडक्ट को अनाउंस करते हुए इस वीडियो में वो पूरी कहानी बताते हैं कि कैसे इस वज को बनाने का उन्हें आईडिया आया वो क्यों बना रहे हैं ये प्रोडक्ट क्या-क्या प्रॉब्लम्स उन्हें फेस करनी पड़ी कैसे उन्होंने आज तक अपने बिजनेस से ₹ रुपए भी नहीं कमाए और सारे इन्वेस्ट कर दिए एसेट एसेट बट मोस्ट इंपोर्टेंट वो ये बोलते हैं प्लस इसके अंदर का जो यूआई हमारी अपनी टीम ने बनाया जिसके अंदर का फर्मवेयर है वो भी हमने खुद बनाया जो प्रोसेसर और पार्ट्स लग रहे हैं वो अभी तक इंडिया में कोई भी नहीं लाया व इसकी जो असेंबली है वो हम इंडिया के बाहर चाइना में करा रहे हैं बट हमारा रोड मैप है इसको 6 महीने के अंदर इंडिया में लाके बनाने का इसके बाद उन्होंने भर-भर के रील्स डाली इस वच को प्रमोट करने के लिए वो पॉडकास्ट में गए वीडियोस में बोले कि हां उनका नया प्रोडक्ट आ रहा है जिसके लिए इस वॉच की हाइप काफी बन रही थी इस वच से वो लोग अपना पर्सनल स्टोरी भी जोड़ रहे थे जिससे ऑडियंस कनेक्ट हो सके एंड या आई हैव टू अग्री दैट उनका मार्केटिंग अच्छा था ये वाला बट इसी बीच वो अनाउंस करते हैं कि उनके वच में कुछ प्रॉब्लम आ गया है तो उनको लॉन्च डिले करना पड़ेगा तो उसके बाद मार्केटिंग फिर से चालू होती है एंड फिर से हाइप बनता है बट फिर से डिले हो जाती है अब इसी चीज को देखते हुए एक यूटर जेंज वे जो कि मार्केटिंग एंड बिजनेस रिलेटेड वीडियोस बनाते हैं अपने चैनल पर वो ये वीडियो अपलोड करते हैं एक बर्नर ने एक महीने तक अपनी घड़ी के नाम प सिर्फ उम्मीदें बेची है क्योंकि उनको पता था कि घड़ी बेचेंगे तो बटेगी भी नहीं और बेच के लिए उनके पास घड़ी थी भी नहीं इन्होंने पॉडकास्ट वीडियो शॉर्ट्स हर जगह पे हल्ला मचवा दिया था कि भैया हमारा नया प्रोडक्ट आने वाला है लच करते करते बोला कि भैया प्रोडक्ट में थोड़ी दिक्कत आ गई है थोड़े टाइम बाद लच करेंगे जो कि एक प्लान का पार्ट भी हो सकता है अब ये शॉर्ट देख के टेक बर्नर ने जंजी वे को ये रिप्लाई दिया टेक बर्नर फेक हाइप क्रिएट करने की कोशिश कर र कुछ लोगों को ये भी लग रहा है हमने घड़ी बनाई नहीं है हम मार्केटिंग कर रहे हैं और बाद में प्रोडक्ट बनाएंगे लच करते करते बोला कि भैया प्रोडक्ट में थोड़ी दिक्कत आ गई है थोड़े टाइम बाद लच करेंगे हमने इस बच के लच को डिले करर था आप में से कुछ लोगों को लग रहा है कि भाई ये फेक हाइप है ये डिले क्रिएट करा गया हाइप क्रिएट करने के लिए दोस्तों हम पिछले 10 साल से एक रिव्यू कर रहे हैं अ हमारा मेन काम प्रोडक्ट का सच बताना होता है सो इसी का रिप्लाई देते हुए जेंज वे एक लॉन्ग फॉर्म वीडियो निकालते हैं जहां पर वो टेक बर्नर को ये रिप्लाई देते हैं और उस पूरी वीडियो को कांटेक्ट को चेंज कर दिया गया और आप लोगों के सामने ऐसे दिखाया गया कि मैं उनके ऊपर कोई ब्लेम लगा रहा हूं मैं उनको झूठा बोल रहा हूं कि भैया घड़ी तो तैयार है नहीं बेच क रहे हो और उस मार्केटिंग के साथ-साथ इन्होंने एक नई तरह की मार्केटिंग भी शुरू कर दी है जिसको आप लोग प्यार से विक्टिम कार्ड भी बोल सकते हो पहले इन्होंने एक वीडियो बनाई कि मेरे जैसे यूट्यूब इनके ऊपर ब्लेम लगा रहे हैं कि भैया आपने घड़ी बनाई भी नहीं है आप बेच क्या रहे हो और अभी कुछ टाइम पहले इन्होंने वीडियो डाली कि भैया लोग हम पे ब्लेम लगा रहे हैं कि हम लोग चाइना में मैन्युफैक्चर कर रहे लोग इस टाइम पे एक्चुअल में चाहता है कि एक कंट्रोवर्सी को क्रिएट किया जाए जिससे वो और उसकी घड़ी दोनों हाइप में आ जाए क्योंकि मार्केटिंग कभी भी पॉजिटिव या नेगेटिव नहीं होती है मार्केटिंग सिर्फ मार्केटिंग होती है एंड इसके बाद वो टेक बर्नर से सवाल करते हुए ये पूछते हैं सबसे पहला पॉइंट ये है कि जो भी लोग इस वीडियो को देख रहे हैं ना वो लोग बिजनेस बैकग्राउंड से नहीं भी है उनके पास भी एक कॉमन सेंस है कि भैया प्रोडक्ट को तब अनाउंस किया जाता है जब प्रोडक्ट रेडी हो जाता है किसी भी प्रोडक्ट को तब अनाउंस नहीं किया जाता जब हम लोग उसके ऊपर काम कर रहे होते हैं और दूसरी बार डिले के आपने तीन कारण और बताए थे पहला कारण आपने बताया कि आप लोग इसकी टेस्टिंग बहुत अच्छे से कर रहे हैं तो इसके अंदर टाइम लग रहा है मेरा क्वेश्चन आपसे बहुत सिंपल है कि जो पहले दो लोग चाप करने वाले थे क्या उसके अंदर टेस्टिंग अच्छे से नहीं हुई थी क्या आप लोग जनता को एक फालतू सामान बेचने के मूड के अंदर थे जिसकी आपने टेस्टिंग तक नहीं की थी फिर और भी सवाल पूछते हैं टेक बर्नर से कि अगर सॉफ्टवेयर में प्रॉब्लम थी तो सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट देके भी वो बाद में ठीक किया जा सकता था एंड टेक बर्नर का जो वीडियो था जहां पर उन्होंने बोला था कि वो लोग 10 साल से टेक वीडियोस बना रहे हैं एंड कभी झूठ नहीं बोला है तो उसपे जिंज वे कहते हैं कि वो पास्ट की बात नहीं कर े यहां पे वो प्रेजेंट की बात करें तो प्रेजेंट की बात करो फिर वो दिखाते हैं कि टेक बर्नर ने टा पे लास्ट 90 डेज के अंडर 29 वीडियोस डाले जिसमें से 12 वीडियोस लेयर्स अनार्क वच का प्रमोशन है और सात ओवरलेज क्लोथिंग का प्रमोशन है और बाकी सारे ऑलमोस्ट ब्रांड प्रमोशन है सिर्फ दो वीडियोस वो अपलोड करते हैं 90 दिनों में जो कि नॉन स्पंस है और जिंज वे ये भी बताया थे कि ऐसे कई सारे रील्स श्लोक ने डाली है जहां पर उन्होंने प्रॉपर तरीके से पेट प्रमोशन मेंशन नहीं किया है या फिर # ऐड मेंशन नहीं किया है एंड बाय द वे ये चीज इल्लीगल है इंडिया में बट इसके बाद टेक बर्नर के तरफ से कोई भी रिप्लाई नहीं आता है बट इसी समय मिस्टर बीस्ट के एसआई और लोगन पॉल इंडिया आए हुए होते हैं तो उनसे जब जब श्लोक मिलते हैं तो उनको श्लोक अपना वच दिखाते हैं और वो देख के फर्स्ट इंप्रेशन देते हैं जब मिस्टर बीस्ट की बारी आते है तो वो काइंड एक प्रमोशनल सेगमेंट होता है जहां पर मिस्टर बीस्ट बोलते हैं कि आई चैलेंज यू टू मेक द बिगेस्ट स्मार्ट वॉच एवर तो उस चैलेंज को तो टेक बर्नर एक्सेप्ट करते और एक वीडियो भी डाल देते हैं लॉन्च के एक दिन पहले और इस वीडियो में वो बेसिकली वर्ल्ड का सबसे बड़ा स्मार्ट वॉच बनाते हैं वेल स्मार्ट वॉच तो नहीं था वो जितना मेरे को देख के लगा वो एक स्मार्ट टीवी था जिसके अराउंड इन्होंने फ्रेम लगवा दिया था वीडियो में वो टच करके स्लाइड करने की एक्टिंग कर रहे जबकि साफ-साफ समझ में आ रहा था कि भाई वो एक वीडियो प्ले किया गया है पहले से या फिर बस स्क्रीन मिरर कर रहे है टीवी में तो यहां भी ऑडियंस उनको कमेंट सेक्शन में ट्रोल करने लगी कि भाई टच स्क्रीन ना स्मार्ट टीवी विद स्क्रीन मिररिंग यस आज 15 नवंबर है भाई बट काम तो फर्स्ट अप्रैल वाला लग रहा है एनीवेज इसके बाद वो फाइनली अपना वज वाला अनबॉक्सिंग वीडियो अपलोड करते हैं और इस वीडियो में वो वज को बनाने की कहानी शेयर करते हैं इस वीडियो में वो दिखाते कि कैसे वो चाइना जाते हैं डिफरेंट मैन्युफैक्चरर्स के पास जाते हैं डिजाइन के लिए लंदन जाते हैं और फिर वो यहां पर सबसे इंपोर्टेंट क्लेम करते हैं यूआई और वॉच फेसेस हमने सारी मेहनत करके खुद अपने हाथों से बनाया एंड इसी के साथ वो बताते हैं कि कैसे उनके वॉच में महंगे महंगे सेंसर्स है जिससे एओट हार्ट रेट इन सब की एक्यूरेसी लेवल बढ़ जाए और बाय द वे यहीं पर जो पहले जेंज वे ने क्लेम किया था कि इनका वच डिले करना एक पब्लिसिटी स्टंट था उसी को क्लियर करते हुए वो प्रॉब्लम्स को खुलकर बताते हैं कि एक्चुअली हुआ क्या था इस स्टेट में तो लच करने लायक नहीं ह और रा पता नहीं ब मेरे पा पै डालने को नहीं का [संगीत] मुश्किल है यार इसको कैसे लॉच कैसे कर टाइड हो जो हमने थोड़ा पता करा हमने रिलाइज करा 30 एफपीएस से 60 एफपीएस तक जाने के लिए पूरे फर्मवेयर को बदलना पड़ता है जो प्रोसेसर जो कंपनी बनाती है उसकी कंपनी के डेवलपर्स को बुलाना पड़ता है पूरा स्टार्टिंग से वो कोड करके हमको दे फर्मवेयर वाली फाइल्स में उसके बाद जाके फिर सॉफ्टवेयर पूरा फिर से बनाना पड़ता है एंड उसमें जो बग्स आएंगे उनको फिर से सॉल्व करना पड़ता बट या इस बार वो लोग सॉफ्टवेयर फिर से बनाते हैं एंड इस बार वो लोग क्लेम करते हैं कि भाई अल्ट्रा की एक्यूरेसी लेवल को उन्होंने मैच करने की कोशिश की है एंड फॉर इंफॉर्मेशन मैं बता दूं कि apple's का वॉच ₹ 77000 का है बट एनीवेज यह वॉच फाइनली लॉन्च होता है एंड उसी के साथ कुछ दिनों में इससे रिलेटेड बहुत सारे रिव्यू वीडियोस अपलोड किए जाते हैं अब ऑलमोस्ट सारे रिव्यू वीडियोस में ही इस वच के प्रोज एंड कॉन्स बताए जाते हैं बट आज हम लोग मेनली तीन रिव्यू वीडियोस की बात करेंगे जहां पर व इस वच के कुछ प्रॉब्लम्स के बारे में बात करते हैं क्योंकि ऑडियंस सबसे ज्यादा टेग बर्नर के कमेंट सेक्शन में इनकी बात कर रही थी सबसे पहले रिव्यू वीडियो की अगर बात करें तो यहां पर गुप्ता इंफॉर्मेशन सिस्टम्स जो वीडियो अपलोड करते हैं वहां पर वो दिखाते कि कैसे जो टेक बर्नर क्लेम कर रहे थे कि इस वच का बॉडी स्टेनलेस स्टील से बना गया है पर यहां पर थोड़ा नाइफ से स्क्रैच करने पर ही स्क्रैचेज आए जा रहे हैं तो वो क्लेम करते कि ये स्टेनलेस स्टील नहीं एलुमिनियम है फिनिशिंग जरा से भी नहीं की गई वॉच में जस्ट एकदम रॉ फिनिशिंग में है आई डोंट थिंक सो गाइ स्टीन स्टील है दिस इज एलुमिनम देखो पर्सनली मुझे इनका रिव्यू वीडियो उतना ज्यादा अच्छा नहीं लगा बॉज इनके पूरे वीडियो से ही बहुत नेगेटिव वाइब्स आ रही थी जब से इन्होंने प्रोडक्ट को ओपन किया था तब से ऐसे वाइब्स आ रहे थे मानो इनके माइंड में था ही कि भाई बुराई करना है इस प्रोडक्ट का इनके रिव्यू वीडियो में से बस एक ही क्लेम मेरे को इंटरेस्टिंग लगा था जो कि मैंने आपको अभी दिखा दिया बाकी हां पूरा टेक कम्युनिटी जो है एक्स पे वो एक्साइटेड थे ज्ञान थेरेपी के रिव्यू के लिए क्योंकि ज्ञान थेरेपी एक ऐसा बंदा है ना जिसके ओपिनियन के लिए बहुत लोग वेट करते हैं मानते भी है तो ज्ञान थेरेपी जब रिव्यू किए तो इन्होंने कुछ पॉजिटिव पॉइंट्स तो बताए बट इसी के साथ इन्होंने बहुत सारे नेगेटिव पॉइंट्स भी दिखाए ज्ञान थेरेपी यहां पर बताते हैं कि फिनिशिंग बिल्कुल एलुमिनियम जैसा दिखता है मैट फिनिश के साथ कॉल इस पे आप कर नहीं सकते सिर्फ रिसीव कर सकते हैं चार्जिंग एडाप्टर का मैग्नेट बहुत लूज है फिर वो बताते हैं कि पिक्सल फो से लेयर्स ए से सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट करने पर अपडेट नहीं हो रहा बट पहले मेंशन किया था वो तो भाई दिया ही नहीं वच में कई फीचर्स मेंशन थे पहले लाइक कांटेक्ट कॉल ब्रीद कैमरा कैलकुलेटर वूमन हेल्थ रिलेटेड है कुछ थीम कैलेंडर फाइंड माय फोन वॉच फेसेस को कस्टमाइज करना हो कुछ नोटिफिकेशन ऑप्शंस ये सब सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट से दिए जाएंगे और एक अपडेट आया था उसमें ये फीचर्स आए तो नहीं अभी तक लेकिन अभी के डेट में लेटेस्ट वेबसाइट से वो सब हटा दिया गया है सिर्फ एक चीज लिखा गया है कि ऑलवेज ऑन डिस्प्ले फ्यूचर अपडेट में दिया जाएगा तो ये क्वेश्चन वाली बात बन जाती है और फिर वच का 60 एपीएस वाला मैटर को टच करते हुए बताते हैं कि वच को नॉर्मली टच करने पर तो 60 एफपीए चलता है बट क्राउन से चलाने पर 30fps पे चलता है इस वच में ऑटो ब्राइटनेस का फीचर भी नहीं है और apple-app-site-association के वीडियोस बहुत पहले देखा करता था एंड आज तक इन्होंने बहुत सारे स्मार्ट वॉचेस एंड फिट बैंड्स का रिव्यू करके रखा है सो यस इनको एक्सपीरियंस है एंड आई डू ट्रस्ट हिज ओपिनियन ऑन स्मार्ट वॉचेस सबसे पहले तो ये ऐप के बारे में बात करते हुए यह बोलते हैं कि प् store's के ऐप को डाउनलोड करके उसके एपी के फाइल को एक्सट्रैक्ट करके एनालाइज किया तो देखा कि इस ऐप में थर्ड पार्टी चाइनीज कंपनीज इंटीग्रेटेड है और लाइव सपोर्ट से जब बात करने गए तो जवाब चाइनीज में आया तो टेक बर्नर ने जो बोला था कि सब इन्होंने बिल्कुल ग्राउंड से अपने हाथों से बनाया आई गेस जवाब आपके सामने इसके बाद डिजाइन की बात करते हुए बोलते हैं कि श्लोक जो इनको बोले थे कि इन्होंने लंडन में डिजाइन किया है इसको बट एक ऐसा सिमिलर डिजाइन एक और वच का भी है फिट बिट ब्लेज बोल के फिर बाकी कुछ पॉइंट्स ज्ञान थेरेपी जैसे ही सिमिलर थे बट एक इंपॉर्टेंट चीज वो यह दिखाते हैं ध्यान से देखिए इन दोनों एप्स को लेयर्स वाली ऐ 100% कॉपीडब्ल्यूबी ये है कि ए वेर वाली ऐप इस एर्क वॉच को खुले दिल से एक्सेप्ट करती है कि ये मेरा ही माल है एप्लीकेशन इज वेरी पैथिक एंड बगी और बहुत ही बेसिक सा यूआई है मेरा कहना है कि ठीक है लिया चाइना से तो लिया लेकिन अच्छा वाला लेते हैं ना और इसके बाद वो आपको ऐसी चीज दिखाते हैं जो कि बाकी रिव्यूअर्स आपको नहीं दिखा रहे और मेरा भी यही क्वेश्चन था कि भाई ये क्यों नहीं टेस्ट कर रहे हो हार्ट रेट मॉनिटरिंग सिर्फ एक बार रीडिंग चेक करने की चीज नहीं है इट इज कॉल्ड मॉनिटरिंग तो आपको इसको कंटीन्यूअसली मॉनिटर करना पड़ता है स्पेशली हम इसको यूज़ करते हैं ड्यूरिंग द वर्कआउट टू कीप आई ओवर आर हार्ट रेट कि हमारा बबम कितना अप जा रहा है कितना लो और अगर बहुत ज्यादा अप जा रहा है तो हम उस समय पॉज ले सकते हैं अपने वकआउट को थोड़ा सा रोक सकते हैं कलर एट चेस्ट स्ट्रैप यूज करहा है जो 99 एक्यूरेट डिवाइस है तो मैंने यहां पे दो ग्राफ्स रखे हैं पोलर ए1 का डटा है और दूसरा एनर्क वॉच का डाटा है लेयर्स वाली वॉच का तो यहां पे जो पैटर्न बनके आ रहा है मिडिल पोर्शन में और इसके मिडल पोर्शन में दोनों बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंट है अब अगर स्पाइक्स पे नजर डाले तो स्पाइक्स 210 गया है ब पोलर एटम का 210 बप और वही अगर अनार्क वाली वॉच का स्पाइक्स वाला डाटा देखिए तो ये मैक्स यहां पे 100 तक ही आके रह गया है तो यही पता चल रहा है कि जब आपको मैक्सिमम हार्ट रेट पता होना था जब हम वर्कआउट कर रहे थे तभी आपको नहीं पता चला कि आपका हार्ट रेट कितना मैक्सिमम गया है तो आपको रुक जाना तो ये बहुत इनकूट है इवन ग्राफ के पैटर्न को देखा जाए तो यहां पे m का पैटर्न बन रहा है पोलर वाले ग्राफ में और इसके ग्राफ में वीवी सा पैटर्न बन रहा है मतलब काफी डिफरेंस है यहां पे और वच के वर्कआउट फीचर के बारे में रोहित ये बोलते हैं वर्कआउट ट्रैकिंग इज टोटली बीएस इन दिस वॉच आप कैसे डिजाइन कर सकते हैं एक ऐसा प्रोडक्ट जो बेसिक चीजें ऑफर ना करे यू कांट कंट्रोल म्यूजिक वाइल वर्किंग आउट इवन आप टारगेट भी सेट नहीं कर सकते हैं और स्लीप मॉनिटरिंग भी इंसान एंड फुकरा इंसान बट इनके रिव्यूज एक ऐसे सीरियस वीडियो में क्यों इंक्लूडेड है मेरे को जितना नॉलेज है ये लोग एंटरटेनर्स है रिव्यूअर्स नहीं है ये भी नॉर्मल कंज्यूमर्स ही है मेरी तरह इसलिए मेरा और इनके ओपिनियन से ज्यादा लोगों को एक्चुअल टेक रिव्यूअर्स के ओपिनियन पे ज्यादा ट्रस्ट करना चाहिए एनीवेज इसमें श्लोक बहुत सारे रिव्यूअर्स का वीडियो देखते हैं एंड कुछ फीडबैक पे उन्होंने रिएक्ट भी किया जैसे क्राउन वाला जो प्रॉब्लम था फिर चार्जर वाला जो था कनेक्टिविटी इशू पे बात करते हैं बक्स की बात करते हैं एंड हां कुछ सॉफ्टवेयर रिलेटेड चीजों को वो बोलते हैं कि वो फिर फस कर देंगे फ्यूचर में और आखिरी में जाकर ज्ञान थेरेपी का वीडियो देखते और इस पे वो बहुत लिमिटेड चीजों पे रिएक्ट करते और मिसिंग फीचर्स को लेके बोलते हैं कि उनके पास ऑप्शन था डालने का पर उन्होंने डाल नहीं उनको बस मेन फीचर्स रखने थे अपने वच पे और apple-app-site-association लेवल पर है नहीं अगर फेयर कंपैरिजन करना है तो भाई सारे फीचर्स के साथ करो ना बट यहीं पर वो प्राइस वाला फैक्टर आ जाता है कि 7000 का घरही है और वो 1 लाख का बट कंपैरिजन भाई आप लोग ही कर रहे हो तो अगर आप एक कंज्यूमर हो तो भाई इस कंपैरिजन पे ध्यान मत दो इंटरनेट इज अ वाइल्ड प्लेस भाई आप इतने सालों से अपनी रेपुटेशन बिल्ड करते हुए आते हो एंड एक इवेंट होता है जो कि आपके रेपुटेशन को काफी हद तक इफेक्ट कर देता है आज से एक दो महीने पहले तक टेक बर्नर का बहुत अच्छा रेपुटेशन था मार्केट में बट इस वच के रिलीज के बाद कहीं ना कहीं उनका रेपुटेशन जाके इफेक्ट हुआ है और पर्सनली मुझे ज्यादा स्मार्ट वॉचेस के बारे में ज्ञान नहीं है और ना ही मैंने इस वॉच को यूज किया है पर्सनली तो मेरे से तो भाई इस वच का रिव्यू एक्सपेक्ट मत ही करना और आई गेस मेरे से ज्यादा ओपिनियन इनका मैटर करता है जो टेक रिव्यू करते हैं बिकॉज वो इस फील्ड में बहुत दिनों से है एंड उनको पता है स्मार्ट वॉचेस के बारे में बट हां अगर मैं ऊपर ऊपर से देखूं तो भाई इस वॉच का डिजाइन एज अ कंज्यूमर मेरे को पसंद नहीं आया मुझे ऐसे स्क्वायर एजेस वाले घर ही पसंद नहीं है इससे कई ज्यादा एस्थेटिक एल वच है और इसको मैं पार्टी में जाके भी पहन सकता हूं एंड आई नो टेक ब से डिसएग्री करेंगे बट भाई टेस्ट इज सब्जेक्टिव बाकी टेक बर्नर का जो अनाउंसमेंट वाला वीडियो था उसमें एक्चुअली इन्होंने बहुत अच्छी स्टोरी टेलिंग की थी और मार्केटिंग भी बहुत अच्छी की थी उन्होंने बस अगर प्रोडक्ट उस लेवल का हो जाता जैसा उन्होंने क्लेम किया था तो आई गेस बेटर रहता बाकी यहां तक वीडियो देख लिया तो कमेंट कर देना टेक और अगर आपको नहीं पता कि कैसे पुनीत सुपरस्टार ने अपना रेपुटेशन टोटली डिस्ट्रॉय कर लिया तो इस वीडियो को क्लिक करके अभी देख लो

village where everyone is connected but we should remember to use social media wisely it's easy to spend too much time on it which can affect our daily lives and mental health that's very true Julia it's important to set limits and be mindful of our social media use we should make sure it doesn't interfere with our work studies or personal relationships another important aspect of communication technology is instant messaging apps like WhatsApp messenger and telegram allow us to chat with our friends and family in real time instant messaging is very convenient we can have quick conversations

avoid sharing sensitive information and be aware of the privacy settings on our apps and social media accounts and we should also be respectful and kind in our online interactions it's easy to misunderstand or hurt someone with our words so we should always think before we post or send a message absolutely communication technology is a powerful tool but with great power comes great responsibility we should use it to build positive and meaningful connections so to sum up technology has revolutionized the way we communicate from phones and video calls to email and social media we

changed the way we learn from online classes to educational apps there are many new new ways to gain Knowledge and Skills so stay with us as we explore the exciting world of technology in education we'll be right back after a short break segment two technology and education now let's talk about education Julia how do you use technology to learn I use my computer for online classes it's like going to school but on the internet I can learn from home it's very convenient because I don't have to travel and I can study in a comfortable environment that's cool there are many websites and apps for learning they make studying fun and easy with just a few clicks we can find resources for any subject we are interested in yes I use apps to learn new languages it's very interactive and engaging apps like dualingo and babble make learning languages feel like playing a game they have lessons quizzes and even speaking exercises to help improve our skills we can also watch videos on YouTube to learn new things there are tutorials for everything whether it's cooking playing a musical instrument or understanding complex science topics there's a video for it yes from cooking to science experiments we can learn anything I love watching educational channels like Ted Ed and crash course they explain difficult topics in a simple and interesting way online classes and educational apps are very helpful they offer flexibility we can learn at our own pace if we don't understand something we can rewind the video or reread the lesson until it makes sense that's true but sometimes it can be challenging we need to be disciplined and manage our time well without a regular school schedule it's easy to get distracted yes it requires self-discipline but the benefits are worth it we can access information anytime anywhere this is especially useful for people who have busy schedules or live in remote areas and we can connect with teachers and other students online it's a great way to collaborate and share ideas online forums and discussion groups help us to engage with others and get different perspectives technology has made education accessible to many people around the world it's a powerful tool for learning for example people in rural areas can attend online courses from top universities without having to move to a city that's amazing also students with with disabilities can benefit from technology they can use special software and devices to help them learn more effectively for instance screen readers for visually impaired students or speech to text programs for those who have difficulty writing let's talk about some specific tools and platforms that are making a big difference in education one popular platform is Con Academy it offers free courses on a wide range of subjects from math to history and it's available to everyone yes K Academy is fantastic it provides video lessons practice exercises and a personalized learning dashboard students can learn at their own pace and track their progress another great tool is corsera it offers online courses specializations and even degrees Dees from top universities and companies it's a great way to advance your career or learn something new and let's not forget about muk's massive open online courses platforms like edx and Udacity offer these courses which are available to anyone with an internet connection they cover a wide variety of topics and are often taught by professors from prestigious universities these platforms have made it possible for anyone to learn from the best teachers in the world regardless of where they live or their financial situation it's a huge step towards making education more inclusive speaking of inclusivity there are also many educational resources available in different languages this helps non-native speakers to learn and understand the content better yes that's very important and Technology also enables teachers to use various multimedia tools to make lessons more engaging they can use videos animations and interactive quizzes to enhance The Learning Experience let's talk about virtual classrooms tools like Zoom Microsoft teams and Google Classroom have become very popular especially during the pandemic mic they allow teachers and students to interact in real time just like in a physical classroom virtual classrooms are great because they bring the classroom experience to our homes teachers can give live lectures students can ask questions and everyone can participate in discussions and these tools often have features like breakout rooms where students can work in small groups and digital whiteboards where teachers can write and draw just like on a physical whiteboard another interesting technology in education is gamification this involves using Game elements in learning to make it more fun and motivating for example apps like cahoot turn quizzes into interactive games that students enjoy playing gamification can make learning more engaging and help students stay motivated ated by earning points Badges and rewards students feel a sense of achievement and are encouraged to keep learning technology also helps in personalizing education adaptive learning platforms like DreamBox and smart Sparrow adjust the difficulty of lessons based on the students's performance this way students get a tailored learning experience that suits their needs yes personalized learning is very effective it ensures that students are neither bored with material that is too easy nor overwhelmed with content that is too difficult another benefit of technology and education is the ability to access a wealth of resources online libraries journals and databases provide students with a vast amount of information for their research and studies that's right we websites like Google Scholar and JS tour offer access to academic papers and articles students can find reliable sources and references for their assignments and projects and let's not forget about digital textbooks ebooks are often cheaper and more convenient than traditional textbooks students can carry multiple books on a single device and access them anytime anywhere yes digital textbooks also have interactive features like search functions hyperlinks and multimedia elements that enhance the learning experience another interesting development is the use of artificial intelligence in education AI can help in grading assignments providing feedback and even tutoring students in certain subjects AI tutors can be very helpful they can answer students questions explain difficult Concepts and provide personalized support which is especially useful for subjects like math and science and AI can also help teachers by automating administrative tasks like attendance and Grading giving them more time to focus on teaching and interacting with students yes technology has really transformed education in so many ways it has made learning more accessible engaging and personalized but it's important to remember that technology is just a tool it can enhance learning but it cannot replace good teaching the role of teachers is still very important absolutely teachers guide Inspire and support students they help students develop critical thinking skills and a love for learning technology should be used to support teachers not replace them and students also need to develop digital literacy skills they need to know how to use technology effectively and responsibly yes digital literacy is very important students should learn how to find Reliable information protect their privacy and use technology in a way that is ethical and respectful so to sum up technology has revolutionized education it offers many benefits such as flexibility accessibility and personalized learning but it also requires self-discipline and digital literacy that's right and while technology can enhance learning it cannot replace the human touch that teachers bring it's important to find a balance and use technology in a way that supports and enriches the educational experience now let's move on to our next segment technology in daily tasks we will talk about how technology helps us with our everyday activities and makes our lives easier yes from online shopping to Smart Home devices technology plays a big role in our daily routines stay

so3a1yVJ3XY,I wasted a LOT of Money on Mystery Tech 😅,Subscribe for more! https://www.youtube.com/austinevans TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@austintechtips Instagram: ...,Austin Evans,2024-12-08T16:01:13Z,28,"['Mystery Tech', 'Tech Review', 'Gadgets', 'Unboxing', 'Funny', 'Comedy', 'Telescope', 'Vaonis Hestia', 'LG DualUp Ergo', 'Vertical Monitor', 'AI Dock', 'HiDock H1', 'Karaoke Machine', 'Ikarao Break X2', 'Porsche 911', 'Austin Evans', 'Porsche', 'Porsche 911 T', 'Austin', 'Evans']",PT17M24S,325554,500,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology']",True,"- I was playing ""Crash
Bandicoot 1"" the other day, and I was reminded about
how similar you two are. - This is a Vaonis. This just sounds like
someone asked ChatGPT to give them fake names for a product, but it did win a CES 2024
Best of Innovation Award. - [Ken] Yeah, you could buy those. - So it tells me to download the Gravity by Vaonis Hestia app. So, this is gonna be a telescope, right? Do you put your phone in here, perhaps? My Z Flip's too tall for this. - [Ken] Yeah, 'cause you're
using a (duck quacking) Z Flip. - Fine! Okay, I'll use an iPhone. It's very hard to kinda see. - [Matt] What if you got
the app and it helped you decide where to put it? - Fine. Okay, I'll
download the stupid app. All right, I have to
give them my location. - [Matt] 'Cause they help
you with constellations. - Camera.
- [Matt] Yep. 'Cause you're looking through a camera. - Photos? - [Matt] You're taking the photos. - Why would it need
access to all my photos? - [Matt] So it can draw the
constellation of your photos. I don't know. - I hate when there are great features built by Google and Apple
to help protect your privacy and apps go, ""This doesn't work unless you give us all your stuff. Uwu."" So I need to put it on its tripod. Where's its tripod? - [Ken] We have like so many god (duck quacking) tripods and stuff. - [Austin] It says I'm supposed to put it on the Hestia tripod. - [Ken] Oh, that's awful. - [Austin] So I'm gonna go find a tripod, take this thing outside, and we'll see if we can
actually get it to work somehow. - [Matt] Sounds like a
Joanna problem. (laughs) - I've put my phone in it. So if you pick it up, you can see that this little lens right here attaches to the actual front. So I'm sure it's a series of
mirrors and one on the side. And then, to actually line your phone up, you just put it in this little like guide. ""Pick a mode based on
what you wanna observe."" I wanna observe scenery. A very tight shot of a lot of trees. Interesting. It's very... What is that? I don't really have time for that. Let's see, how do I change the mode. So I wanna do sun. Oh, you're supposed to
install a sun filter. I think for the best effect, you kind of need to use this at night. It does work during the daytime,
and it is really zoomed in. Like I'm zooming in on
the top of that tree all the way up there, and you see it looks pretty good. (plane engine buzzing) Plane, plane. Where's the plane? Oh, I found it, I found it. I saw it for a second. I'll be right back, my friends. Once I've waited until the sun is set, and my ambitions for being
a creep have been fully... I mean... I have spent some time with the Vaonis Hestia iPhone telescope. We took it outside. We tried to use it just to
look in like normal daytime and it is very blurry, right? Even when you would go into the app and adjust the focus and whatnot. So I'm like, okay, well lemme try this. Let me try it at night. The best thing I got was this
beautiful photo of a moon. So here's what I'm doing, right? I'm in the middle of the night, I got my telescope out, I got my phone on here, I've got my freaking
flashlight pointing at the lens so I can see if there's anything
on the actual sort of lens. I'm adjusting it ever so slightly, just to get a blurry photo of the moon that's not even that close. - The thing is that
I've had better results actually just holding up my
phone to like a binocular. - How much was this absolute nonsense? - [Alex] The MSRP for it right now is $250, but through Matt's ingenuity, we got it really early
through Kickstarter... - [Ken] Sick.
- [Alex] For 150. - Maybe I'm missing
something catastrophic, and if I am, lemme know in the comments. But this is top three worst Mystery Tech items I've ever tried. Well, it's because I spent so much time trying to get it to work! Why is this a square monitor? What? The LG DualUp Ergo is a
resolution of 2560 x 2880. - [Matt] It's squarical. This is the preferred monitor in the Excel eSports tournament. - Is it really? - [Matt] I don't know. I
might be making that up. - You could put two of these
on one stand it looks like. Wow, that's too much power. - [Matt] Yeah. - Just feel how hefty. - Oh, that's a boy, dude. - I feel like I'm holding
like a picture frame, not a monitor. Look at the size of that clamp, my dude. - Ooh we. So I'm going to mount this. Oh, I almost stepped on the monitor. - [Matt] Okay. No, no, no, you... no, I will say that is
the girthiest like clamp. - This is a great use of the word girth. What the hell? That looks weird. - [Matt] I kind of dig it. - So behold my friends a tallboy. - [Ken] You don't have friends
after you hold that monitor. Let's see. - I regret putting the cable management in before I put the paper top on. - [Matt] Oh my, God. Oh god. Oh Jesus. Well, there goes that. - It's okay. And then theoretically, yeah, there we go. So if I wanna put this
all the way to the top and go to the This Is channel, what you see is you just got a whole bunch of vertical screen estate. Matt is really dumb. I don't like Matt. - [Matt] You missed the worst part. - You misread sexy. - So let's go into settings. Oh, picture by picture I saw, yeah. - You wanna go picture by picture, yeah. - What you're seeing right now
is a one laptop on the bottom and one laptop on the top. So these are completely independent, or I could have all of this
real estate dedicated to one. - Oh God. - Oh no. Oh, oh, oh, oh. - You could almost do it like quad view or like a third view. - Yeah. So I could be
watching a Denki video on one side of the monitor and then I could watch a This Is
video on the other side. - [Ken] Whoa. - This is a very cool monitor. I like the stand that it comes on. Especially 'cause you could add a second one of these to it apparently. - [Matt] If you did any business. - How much does this
particular LG monitor cost? Because it's gonna be a
premium over just buying some generic 1440p monitor, right? - [Ken] Yes. - [Alex] It retailed for $700. - In 2022? - [Matt] Yes.
- [Ken] Yeah. - Okay. And now it costs... - [Alex] Well we paid the $700. But if, you know, you're
one of our audience members and you're seeing this for the first time. Yeah. And for whatever reason you think that this is really neat, you could buy it for $550 on Amazon or something. - If you're thinking about
doing multiple monitors, which is obviously a nice thing, but you don't wanna deal with the bezels and everything like that. And potentially you could have, say, especially if you rotated
it this direction, you could say have like
your regular PC on one half of the display and like a console
or something on the other. I actually am gonna give this a thumbs up. It's legitimately really cool. $700 is too much, but for 500,
550, it's not for everybody. But honestly this is one
of the coolest monitors I've looked at in a long time. Like this is actually cool. I'm not mad that it was so much money. - Oh, heavy. - Is this some like music thing? Wait, is this a karaoke machine? - [Ken] It is a karaoke machine. - Peak power 600 watts. Kenneth, is this because
you did that karaoke video? - [Ken] Yes. - [Austin] Is this a
shameless bit of promotion for your karaoke video? - [Ken] Yes. - So this is the Ikarao Break X2 is a 10 inch Android tablet. - I karaoke more than anyone in this room. - Okay. No, that's a lie. - Ken, when everyone else
goes home, do you just sit around the office just using. - [Ken] Yeah, 'cause I can't
do it at home in my apartment. - I blasted the Mariah Carey all day. - Well you do it in the shower though. The shower, that's not real karaoke - [Matt] But I belt it. - [Austin] So we got
ourselves two microphones. They're Bluetooth with an
ultrasensitive connection. I mean ultrasensitive
Bluetooth connection. How are we gonna show this without getting copyrighted
to the stone ages? Brother? (Ken laughing) That is a box of fun right there. It got all kinds of ports on the back, including HDMI, USB. - [Ken] There's a screen on the top. - Oh. - [Ken] I may or may not have set it up. - Have you already used this, Ken? - [Ken] Yes. Have you watched Denki? - I skim. So I've got Singplay,
KaraFun, and YouTube direct to your karaoke channel. So you can just open the YouTube app and just sing along with any video. - [Ken] Open up the YouTube app for me and tell me what's wrong with it. - Well I see Rick Asley's
""Never gonna give you up"" here. Oh, this got removed
the other day didn't it? - [Ken] What? - Yeah, they lost a license or whatever. ♪ Never gonna... ♪ - [Ken] You can use like their
built-in karaoke service. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Ken] But realistically, most people just probably look up stuff on YouTube. - This is the new karaoke, my friends. Super. Whoa. Super, super good. Professional. Oh whoa. Oh hello. How about Monster? Hello. - [Ken] Wow, you sound like Matt. - Cartoon. Hey it's me. Hi, this is my regular
voice. What the heck? Come on down. ♪ And I will always love you ♪ - Everybody, this next song I'm gonna sing has some explicit lyrics, so- - [Ken] Oh, God. - Edit team, you know what to do, right? ♪ Snoop D O GG ♪ and the group just said (laughs) - [Ken] Wow, that is
the Kid's Bop version. - I'm out of practice, y'all. - [Matt] What's your heart
rate right now, my dude? - I don't know? A lot. How much was this karaoke machine? - [Ken] It retails right now for $300. Yeah, we got it on sale. - It's pretty good. Why is this seat so warm? ♪ You got me questioning,
where is the love ♪ - Mystery Tech! - [Matt] Speaking of expensive. - I know this. We did this on ""This
Is,"" and it didn't work. So this is, my friends, is the HiDock H1. This little thing called
AI is all the rage. And this is a dock for your computer that will also allow you to record calls and use GPT to summarize said calls, and scrape your insider
trading information. I mean make sure that
you've got nice summaries. 11 ports, so it's an actual hub. - [Matt] Yes.
- What the hell? You didn't even put it
back in the box right. - [Matt] I threw away half the stuff before you said you wanted it again. - You got a Better Call
Saul style earpiece. You just- - [Ken] Oh, I can feel the KPIs now. - Can I help you? Yes, I'll transfer your call. We have ourselves the dock, which I almost actually feels quite nice. So you've got a big speaker, you've got a little like rotary dial and then the way that
it's supposed to work is that your little earpiece
guy magnetically attaches to the side and theoretically it will just transfer the call over. And then around the back we
actually have a lot of ports. You've got an additional card reader and one more USB port
that's meant for charging as well as a Bluetooth button. So like enough stuff that if
you're just looking for a dock that also has like a
speaker, like this is cool. Now, if I remember
right, it uses a web app. You don't actually install anything. - [Matt] Right.
- You use the web app. So I'm on the HiDock website, I can tell you how much it is, $279. Powered by GPT-4o, 100% auto. So record, transcribe, and summary. How do I... wait? How do I make this thing do something? No compatible devices found. Okay, so after disconnecting
and reconnecting it, doing a firmware update,
all kind of stuff, theoretically this is working. I actually wanna just do a recording of a local conversation, right? So this is like in the
middle of my conference room. I'm having a meeting with
Matt and Ken over the KPIs on- - [Matt] Do you even know
what KPI stands for? - Key performance indicators. We are going to begin this
year's yearly performance review. The 33% highest performing team members. Unfortunately the other 66%
of the team has been let go because that's the way
that the company works. But congratulations, you've
made it through the Hunger... I mean through the the
2024 yearly culling. - [Matt] We should buy Quebec. - I think the most important
conversation when it comes to our domination of the Canadian
wilderness are the moose. They're terrifying. - [Matt] You can't tell me
that a moose is not a dinosaur. - That's the thing- - What you're proposing is treason. - What's a little treason between friends? Am I right? The other thing that we need to discuss is what we do with the
Great Northern Wilderness. My thought is that we
make hockey mandatory, provide some value to the
stakeholders by selling all of the oil, trees, dirt. - [Matt] We could just give them 50 bucks and they'll give us the country. There's like one guy and a polar bear. - So we have the unknown speakers quote, ""We should buy Quebec."" The title of this document,
2024 Yearly Performance Review and Plans for Canadian Domination. ""The transcript details a humorous and satirical performance review."" Satirical, how dare you. ""The speaker proposes controlling
the moose population in Canada as part of a secret
operation to take over Quebec."" It gives me an outline with emojis. I wanna say it's really dumb and goofy. But on the other hand, this hardware, while it's a little pricey, has
a decent speaker, good mics. - So here's the thing I'm gonna argue. This is a, I would say, a
better than average dock. Ignoring the AI bit of this,
I think for 270, this is actually one of the best docks
you can get for productivity. - It's about as good as
something like this could be. I'll put it like that. It's actually kind of neat. This was recommended by a
very kind user on Threads. Who suggested this would be a- - [Ken] Threads? - Yeah, all the cool kids are on Threads. - [Matt] How do you do fellow kids? - [Ken] Ohhh, let's go! - These, my friends. - [Ken] You got the shoes. - I figured I've been made fun of
because I own driving shoes, but I have a good reason for this. Oh my god, brother. I figured it would be a great time for me to upgrade my shoe game. - [Matt] What do you mean by that? - Now only do I have some fresh new kicks, but I have a matching item to go with it. - [Matt] Oh boy. Is it... Please tell me it's not a road sock. - [Kinsey] I think these might just be shoes. - [Ken] Yeah, they don't
have the rounded back. - You know what... Nevermind, these are
just regular cool shoes. - [Ken] Under the bridge pull- - No, I have two sets
of shoe laces. How do I- - [Matt] You take one off? - I'm so used to my
butler doing this for me. So usually my hand is full of brandy. - Well cool, I have a key chain. This will go perfectly. - [Matt] Oh, that's what
that noise was this morning. - [Ken] All the gunshots. - [Matt] Yeah. - [Ken] Outside of the office. - You know, I had this like
inspirational speech. I was about to tell but y'all aren't ready- - We've been waiting for you
to tie shoes for 20 minutes. - Oh geez. Well the value- - [Kinsey] You wanna make
sure your microphone is off. - [Ken] And you have to
pay for our new microphone now that you broke it. - [Kinsey] No. - [Matt] Is that a tag
sticking outta your pocket or are you just happy to see me? - Hey. Oh, what the hell? What the heck? Come outside with me friends.
I have something to share. - [Kinsey] Is it
before or after you guys learn how much these cost? - Oh yeah. How much are these shoes? - [Kinsey] 189. - Okay, that's what I was wondering. - Okay. - That's normal price. - [Kinsey] And they're still available. - Limited edition shoes, baby. - [Matt] What the hell is this? - 10 years ago I was staying
in Mountain View, California for the launch of the Google Ara. I was walking across the freeway over to the Computer History Museum, and this guy pulls up in an orange 911 that looked just like this. Me as a little baby. I'm like, oh. He just looked at me really cool and then absolutely punched it, was gone. In that moment I said I need
to own one of those in my life. - [Matt] This is yours. - This is mine.
- This car really said... - This, my friends, is
my 1971 Porsche 911 T. - [Matt] I wanna bully you so hard. - Dude, look how cool it is. - [Matt] Okay. - [Matt] We just burned five
penguins worth of fossil fuels. - Alright, but here's the best part. - [Matt] Gotta love
that German engineering. - [Austin] Wait, we have backseats. Who wants the backseat? Get in boys, let's go. - [Matt] You expect me to fit in this car? - You guys can rock, paper, scissors on who gets the backseat? - Rock, paper, scissors. Get in the (duck quacking)
back seat of the car. - [Ken] Okay. All right. My back doesn't feel any
better than it did earlier. Oh, okay. - I'm so happy right now
for a lot of reasons, but mostly to see this. - [Matt] Oh god. - Oh boy. Oh, lots of space, right? - There's no handle. Why is there no handle? - Goodbye friends. - Oh, God. What is this squeaking. Oh, it's got no power steering. So - [Matt] Oh, God's go. Oh God. You said it didn't go fast. - Air cool baby. - You said it didn't go fast. - Yeah, but it's also light. - But I'm not. - I will say I got this for a lot less than you might think it was. Mostly 'cause there's some things broken. Like I don't have a working odometer. - [Matt] What? Oh God. Oh God. - Let's go. - What the (duck quacking), man. Do the brakes work in this? - Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
(all laughing) - Dude thought it was just a drive by. - I actually sold my fun
car earlier this year. So this is way slower, but
it's so much more engaging. Like everything is manual. Five speed. You've got no power steering. It's a little finicky when
it comes to like starting, There's a whole procedure
that I've had to learn to not stall the damn thing or just to get it to
start from the beginning. - Your oil light's on. - It's always on. - How do I get out of this thing? Yeah. - And that my friends is a wrap
for today's ""Mystery Tech."" It's tech, right? - Yeah."

इनटू अ इंटरेक्ट वे यू कैन शक हे इस तरीके का इन्होंने फायर सेफ्टी सिस्टम लगाया है ये जो गन दिखाई पड़ रही है ना एडवांस है सो इस टॉर्च में 3 किमी तक आपकी स्पष्ट लाइट जाती है ये जो दिखाई पड़ रहा है यह बहुत ही बेहतरीन चीज है गांव-गांव में यह वाला मेडिकल सिस्टम होना चाहिए अब लाइव दिखाता हूं कैसे उड़ने वाली टैक्सी काम करती है यह वाला जो स्टॉल है यह नॉर्थ चाइना इलेक्ट्रिक पावर यूनिवर्सिटी द्वारा बनाया गया है जिसमें अब देखो ड्रोन की शुरुआत करता हूं एक-एक करके ड्रोन को सिस्टमिक दिखाता हूं वाला ड्रोन है जो अनलिमिटेड रेंज के लिए उड़ सकता है यह वाली जो कंपनी है यह मिलिट्री वाले ड्रोन बनाती है गुड मॉर्निंग दोस्तों मैं हूं आपका भाई आपका दोस्त निरंजन फिलहाल आ चुका हूं चाइना के शामन सर में जो कि फुजिया राज्य में पड़ता है और मेरे पीछे जो आपको ड्रोन दिखाई पड़ रहा है ये यहां पे होने वाले एक टेक्नोलॉजी के से संबंधित इन्वेस्टमेंट एक्सपो है इन्वेस्ट इन चाइना के अंतर्गत यहां बहुत सारे एक्सपो होते हैं उसी के अंदर यह हो रहा है मेरे पीछे जो दिखाई पड़ रहा है वो है 24 वा चाइना इंटरनेशनल फेयर फॉर इन्वेस्टमेंट एंड ट्रेड जो कि शमन सिटी में पिछले साल का फेयर मैंने आपको दिखाया था अभी इस फेयर के अंदर पीछे की तरफ देखो ये बहुत बड़ा ड्रोन दिखाई पड़ रहा है यह शमन यूनिवर्सिटी के बच्चों द्वारा बनाया गया इसी के साथ यहां बहुत सारे ड्रोन के सैंपल लगे हुए हैं यही नहीं अंदर की तरफ बहुत सारी एडवांस टेक्नोलॉजी भी है सबको एक-एक बाय टॉपिक बाय टॉपिक सबसे डिटेल से दिखाऊंगा तो चलिए मेरे साथ करते हैं वीडियो के शुरुआत और लीजिए आनंद एक-एक टेक्नोलॉजी का सबसे पहले यही वाला मॉडल दिखा देता हूं जिसे dragon's इंजीनियरिंग शामन यूनिवर्सिटी के द्वारा बया बनाया गया है इसकी कुछ खासियत ऐसी है कि इसके दो पीछे भी दो आगे विंग है और दो मिडल में विंग है ऐसे करके छ विंग इन्होने बना रखे हैं और इधर भी देखो यह दो इधर दे रखे दो उधर दे रखे ठीक ऐसे करके चार जगह इन्होने पंखे इसके दे रखे हैं अब इसको अलग अलग इसके यूज होते हैं पूछते हैं इनसे कि इसको यूज कहां करते हैं य यूनिवर्सिटी के स्टूडेंट यर वा यह दोस्तो कह रहे हैं कि इसको एयर टैक्सी में यूज किया जाना है वा अमेजिंग यार यह एई से युक्त बहुत सारे यहां पर ड्रोन इनसे पूछते हैं निहा निम यह कह रहे यह जो वर्टिकल जाने वाले ड्रोन है सो यह कहां चम यो सो यह कह रहे यह तो इनका एक मॉडल है व ये कहे कि यह तो इनका एक मॉडल है देखो मेरे हाथ में आपको दिखाई पड़ रहा होगा इस मॉडल को यह एग्रीकल्चर में यूज करते हैं वैसे तोय छोटा मॉडल इन्होने दिखाया क्योंकि एक्सपो में बड़ी बड़ी चीजें तो यह ला नहीं सकते एकदम छोटा सा मॉडल है ये वर्टिकल यूज में किया जाने वाला ड्रोन है इसके अलावा और भी ये बहुत सारे ड्रोन यहां पे प्रदर्शनी में लगाए गए हैं जो कि अलग-अलग क्वालिटी के अलग-अलग इनकी विशेषताएं हैं अभी अंदर ले जाकर के ऐसे ही अनेकों ड्रोन जो अंदर की तरफ प्रदर्शनी में लगे हैं उनकी विशेषता आपको दिखाऊंगा फिलहाल आप बाहर का ये जो आनंद लीजिए इन व्यू का एडवांस टेक्नोलॉजी यहां भर भर के है अंदर ना केवल ये जो ड्रोन देखने को मिलेगा बल्कि आपको रोबोट्स भी देखने को मिलेगा पिछली बार मैंने आपको एक रोबोटिक एक्सपो दिखाया था उसी के साथ-साथ यहां ये रोबोटिक जो ड्रोन है वो भी देखने को मिलेगा इधर देखो सबसे पहले आ चुका है इंटेलिजेंट मिनी फायर रेस्क्यू स्टेशन जिसमें लगी यह दो मशीने और यह पहली वाली है इसके ऊपर तो एक ड्रोन भी रखा है आखिरकार इनसे पूछते हैं यह ड्रोन किस काम आता [संगीत] है दोस्तो का कहने का मतलब है कि अगर ऊंची बिल्डिंग में आग लग जाए तो हम तो वहां पहुंच नहीं सकते तो यह उंची है मतलब यह जो ड्रोन है यह पहुंचता है और इनके हाथ में यह जो पानी की पाइप है इसको च क अगर सयो की व्यवस्था हो वहां तक पहुंचने की और वहां तक अगर लिफ्ट पहुंच नहीं पा रही हो तो यहां पे हम इसको ऐड करते हैं या फिर यहां भी ऐड कर सकते हैं उसके साथ इसके बा इसके नीचे इसको सेटअप करके उंची मतलब जो इस ड्रोन है इसको उड़ा करके उस जगह की आग को बुझाते हैं यह देखो पुलिस की कार है जिसके अंदर वैसे बैठ कर के पुलिस वाले विश्राम भी कर सकते हैं मगर यह वाली जो कार है ये ड्राइवर लेस है पूरी और यह बाहर की तरफ है ना पुलिस का एक कुत्ता है जो आराम से पेट्रोलिंग का काम करता है अब देखो यह जो रियल कुत्ते होते हैं ना उनसे भी बेहतर बन गया है आजकल यह मॉडर्न कुत्ता आगे दिखाऊंगा कितना खतरनाक होता है यह इसको कैसे लात मारो कितना ऑब्स्ट कल आया इसके सामने सब जगह यह जा सकता है और भी बहुत कुछ चीजें होती है यह जो कार है इसके अंदर आदमी बैठ सकता है दो लोगों के बैठने की इसके अंदर जगह होती है लेकिन मोस्ट ऑफ टाइम इसके अंदर कोई होते नहीं पुलिस वाले और यह सड़कों के ऊपर ऑटोमेटिक घूमती रहती है पेट्रोलिंग का काम करती है और इसके ऊपर है ना एक ड्रोन भी होता है देखो कितनी हाईटेक है ऊपर यह देखो इस तरीके से एक ड्रोन भी लगा हुआ है तो अगर इसको जरूरत पड़ पड़ी ड्रोन उड़ा कर के किसी जगह की निगरानी करने की तो ये ड्रोन के थ्रू भी उसकी निगरानी की जा सकती है तो ये देखो सेफ्टी कार है ये बिना किसी ड्राइवर की पुलिस बहुत हाईटेक है चाइना के अंदर सड़कों प कभी भी आपको कोई भी यहां पुलिस नहीं दिखाई पड़ेगी फिर भी चाइना में क्राइम नहीं होता ये देखो बहुत ही इंपॉर्टेंट चीज दिखाता हूं ये है जो एंटी ड्रोन गियर बोलते हैं इसको गन है ये इससे ड्रोन को नीचे गिराया भी जा सकता है और ड्रोन को जहां से उड़ा है ना वहां भेजा जा सकता है इसके ऊपर देखो गियर लगा हुआ है ये देखो ये गियर है इसको अगर आपने इधर फोर्स लैंडिंग की तरफ किया ना तो ड्रोन है जहां से इस परे फायर किया गया वहीं से नीचे आएगा और अगर यहां ड्राइव ऑफ किया है मतलब जहां से ड्रोन उड़ा था वहां जाके उतरेगा और इसको कुछ नहीं करना इतना इजी ऑपरेशन है इसको यहां से मह करके यहां लेके आना है बस इसका काम हो गया चालू और ये ड्राइव ऑफ और किसके कैसी फ्रीक्वेंसी निकालनी है इसे देखो यहां से बैटरी डलता है इसके अंदर और इधर सामने की तरफ है ना यहां से इसकी फ्रीक्वेंसी निकलती है ये मेरे पास में एक ड्रोन का एग्जांपल भी रखा है है ये जो ड्रोन है ना ये डीजेआई का ड्रोन है और डीजेआई के ड्रोन की जो फ्रीक्वेंसी होती है 5.8 की फ्रीक्वेंसी होती है और नीचे यह लखा रखा हुआ चीज है ना यह है ड्रोन को डिटेक्ट करने का काम करता है इसको देखो ड्रोन डिटेक्टर बोलते हैं एयर स्टार तो ये वाला क्या करता है जैसे कोई ड्रोन आया तो ये इंफॉर्मेशन दे देगा कि कोई ड्रोन हवा में उड़ रहा है फिर जैसे ही कोई वहां पे सिक्योरिटी स्टाफ होगा इससे उस चीज को गिराया जा सकता है बहुत ही बेहतरीन चीज है और यह काम करने के साथ-साथ इनको चाहिए एक सॉफ्टवेयर वो सॉफ्टवेयर और ये तीन चीज एक साथ होती है एक दो और एक सॉफ्टवेयर तभी इसको काम में लिया जा सकता है जैसे-जैसे टेक्नोलॉजी का विकास हो रहा है पब्लिक सिक्योरिटी एक चैलेंजिंग विषय बन चुका है इस चीज से निपटने के लिए जो मैंने छोटी-छोटी डिवाइस आपको दिखाई जो एंटी ड्रोन डिटेक्टर है या फिर ड्रोन को नीचे उतारने या फिर ड्रोन को खेलने के काम में आने वाली गन है इन सब चीजों को अगर पब्लिक सिक्योरिटी में यूज किया जाए तो जो आर्मी या पुलिस वाले हैं उनकी लाइफ बहुत आसान हो जाएगी और इन चीजों को जरूर इंपोर्ट भी करना चाहिए और उनको इंप्लीमेंटेशन में उन लोगों को देना भी चाहिए ये जितने भी सिस्टम आपको इधर दिखाई पड़ रहे हैं ना यह पुलिस के काम में आने वाले सिस्टम्स हैं और यह क्या करते हैं आपकी सिक्योरिटी का निर्धारण करते हैं ये यहां पे चाइना में जैसे आपको कहीं भी पुलिस तो दिखाई पड़ेगी नहीं लेकिन फिर भी इन लोगों के पास ना कहीं भी कोई क्राइम नहीं होता कोई रेप वगैरह ऐसा कुछ भी आपको देखने को नहीं मिलता क्योंकि यहां पे हर जगह आपको कैमरे देखने को मिलते हैं उन कैमरों में भी अलग-अलग क्वालिटी होती है देखो यहां पे अलग-अलग कैमरा लगा हुआ है तो ये सारी कैमरों के जो एआई टेक्नोलॉजी है उसके बेस पे ये देख लेते हैं कि ये वाला सि भाइ कैसे काम करता है और कौन आ रहा है कौन जा रहा है इस परे कितना कोई जो भी उसका डिटेल रही है उसकी जो हिस्ट्री रही है वह सब काम आती है अब देखो ड्रोन की शुरुआत करता हूं एक-एक करके ड्रोन को सिस्टेमेयर आपको सामने दिखाई पड़ रहा है इस ड्रोन को बोलते हैं लॉन्ग एंडोरेंस ऑयल इलेक्ट्रिक हाइब्रिड यूएवी और इस चीज को देखो आप आराम से किस तरीके से इसके ऊपर क्या-क्या लगा हुआ है इसके ऊपर कैमरा भी लगा हुआ है और पीछे की तरफ और भी बहुत सारी चीजें हैं इसकी जो कैपेसिटी सिटी है वो इसका जो खुद का वजन है वो 15 केजी है और यह 51 केजी तक का सामान उठा सकता है इसके अलावा इधर जो यह दिखाई पड़ रहा है ना इसको इलेक्ट्रिक टॉल फिक्स्ड विंग यूएवी बोलते हैं इसका खुद का जो वजन है वह 5 केजी है और यह जब उड़ता है उस समय यह 24.8 केज तक का सामान उठा के ले जा सकता है और अब आपको यह दिखाई पड़ रहा होगा इतना बड़ा सारा यह यहां पे एक यूवी या यू बोलिए ये एक यहां पे ड्रोन रखा हुआ है जिसका कुछ स्ट्रक्चर इस तरीके से है पीछे की तरफ इसके दो पंखे लगे हुए हैं एक इसकी पूंछ पर पंखा लगा हुआ है और सामने की तरफ अगर बात करो तो यहां भी एक पंखा लगा हुआ है उधर देखो यहां प एक पंखा लगा हुआ है तो ये भाई ये इनका सबसे बड़ा यहां का ड्रोन है इस ड्रोन को बोलते हैं एरियल बेस स्टेशन इमरजेंसी कम्युनिकेशन यूएवी ये जो इसका नाम दिया गया है इस तरीके से है और इसका खुद का जो वजन है वो 30 केजी है और ये 145 किलो तक का सामान लेके जा सकता है - 20 डिग्री से लेकर के प्लस के 50 डिग्री तक यह सारे ड्रोन काम करते हैं इसी के साथ में यहां पर ये एक ड्रोन लगा हुआ है जो कि एग्रीकल्चर परपज में काम में लिया जाता है इनकी अलग-अलग चीजें देखो पीछे की तरफ इन्होंने यहां पर दिखा भी रखा है कि यह किस तरीके से एग्रीकल्चर में काम में लिया जाता है और यहां के साथ-साथ यह ना जो वायर वगैरह आते हैं उनको भी यह ऑटोमेटिक साइडलाइन करके निकलता है सी पावन ओके मैंने इनसे पूछा कितने रुपए का है तो इन्होंने कहा चीपा वन इसका मतलब होता है इंडिया के लगभग मोटा मोटी समझो तो ₹ लाख के करीब बन का यह वाला है यह वाला जो ड्रोन आपको दिखाई पड़ रहा है यह लाकन एंड टेक कंपनी द्वारा बनाया गया है जो कि जिसे इस ड्रोन को जिसका नाम है यहां पे यह है ना x cd45 इसका तो मॉडल नंबर है इसको बोलते हैं थ्रेड मल्टी रोटर यूवी ये वाला जो ड्रोन है इसको इन्होंने बनाया है x थू थिंग की एक कंपनी है इन्होंने यह क्या है पुलिस और सेफ्टी इनके साथ-साथ किसी को अपने खेत की निगरानी करनी हो उसके काम में आने वाला ड्रोन है जिसके अंदर यहां पे माइक भी लगा हुआ कैमरा भी लगा हुआ है किसी को कुछ बोलना है भाई काम करते रहो या फिर रास्ता जल्दी खाली करो ये भाई ऐसे इस काम में आ जाएगा और ये वाला जो ड्रोन दिखाई पड़ रहा है ये भाई शॉर्टेस्ट ट्रांसपोर्टेशन के काम आता है किसी को एक जगह से दूसरी जगह जल्दी से जल्दी लेकर जाना है उसमें काम आएगा या फिर आग लग जाती है तो उसको आग बुझाने के लिए नीचे ये रेड कलर के जो आपको दिखाई पड़ रहे हैं ये उसी के काम के हैं उस आग को बुझाने के लिए ये ऊपर से गिरा दिए जाते हैं किसी को इनसे कांटेक्ट करना हो तो ऊपर देखो ये कंपनियों का मैं नाम दिखा रहा हूं इनको आप इंटरनेट प सर्च करके इनसे बातें कर सकते हो यहां पे ये जितने इंजन आपको दिखाई पड़ रहे हैं यह जितने भी फाइटर जेट्स होते हैं इसके अलावा जो एरोप्लेंस होती है उन सबके अंदर काम में आने वाले इंजंस है ये देखो इधर इन सब का एक मॉडल मैं आपको दिखा रहा हूं छोटे भी हैं बड़े भी हैं हर तरीके के इंजन आपको यहां देखने को मिल रहा है ये अंदर से चलता हुआ आपको लाइव एग्जांपल दिख रहा है ये यहां पे पंखों के साथ-साथ दिखा दिया है पूरा वाली जो कंपनी है आई किंग टेक करके इसका नाम है इन्होंने कुछ यूनिक डिजाइन निकाली है तो यह क्या है एक लोटस शप में इनका निकाला जाता है और यह वर्टिकल उड़ने वाला ड्रोन है जो बहुत सारे काम में किया काम में लिया जाता है यह देखो इस तरीके का ड्रोन है ये आप देख रहे हो ये उड़ेगा उड़ कर के उसके ऊपर बैठ जाता है तो यह क्या है उसको बंद भी कर देगा और सब कुछ हो जाएगा इसके अलावा यहां पे यह ऊंचाई के ऊपर भी जंगलों में है हर जगह इसको लगाया जा सकता है जैसे ही ड्रोन आएगा वो आकर के ऑटोमेटिक इसके ऊपर लैंड करेगा और चार्जिंग में भी लग जाएगा इसके अलावा यह वाला देखो आपको यहां दिखाई पड़ रहा है यह भी इन्होंने लीपे टाइप का बनाया इसके ऊपर भी इसकी सेफ्टी होती है सिक्योरिटी होती है और ऊपर चार्जिंग का भी पूरा सोलर द्वारा इसका सिस्टम दिया गया है यह है यह मीडियम साइज इलेक्ट्रिक अन

किस तरीके से यह चीजें केजीएफ फिल्म में आप डिमांड करोगे तो यह वाला जो ड्रोन है इसको जरूर शामिल करेंगे यह जो ड्रोन देखो आपको मेरे को सामने दिखाई पड़ रहा है इसकी 5.5 किमी की रेंज होती है 33 किग्रा तक का यह वजन ले जा सकता है इसके साथ में यह है ना 72 किमी पर आवर की रफ्तार से उठता है और इसके नीचे अनेशन डलता है इस तरीके के ये जो गोले टाइप के नीचे लगे हैं ना ये गोले के अंदर लगा कर के आप इसको उड़ा सकते हो इधर भी एक ड्रोन दिखाया गया है जिसकी अलग-अलग विशेषताएं हैं यहां कुछ और अलग-अलग ड्रोन है जो फायर सेफ्टी में काम आते हैं इसके अलावा सेफ्टी सिक्योरिटी में भी काम आते हैं ये जैसे इधर ना ये आर्मी वाले

हर कहीं भी उड़ती देखने को मिल जाएगी आपको मानते हैं चीजों का विकास धीरे-धीरे होता है हमारे देश के अंदर भी टेक्नोलॉजी डेवलप होना चाहिए एजुकेशन ऐसा हो जाना चाहिए कि हर एक व्यक्ति कुछ ना कुछ नया बनाने की काबिलियत रखता हो चाइना के अंदर ये इसीलिए संभव हो पाता है क्योंकि यहां इनोवेशन और टेक्नोलॉजी को प्रायोरिटी दी जाती है यहां एजुकेशन है वो सारी गवर्नमेंट स्कूल के अंदर होती है अमीर और गरीब सारे लोग एक ही स्कूल में पढ़ते हैं तो ये बहुत ही बेहतरीन चीज है और यहां कोचिंग इंडस्ट्री तो सरवाइव ही नहीं करती है क्यों क्योंकि इनकी बेसिक एजुकेशन ही इतनी अच्छी होती है कि इनको किसी चीज की कोचिंग लेने की जरूरत ही नहीं है आज देखो यह जो टेक्नोलॉजी के अंदर इतना डेवलपमेंट आया ना ये एक दिन की वजह से नहीं आया इसके अंदर इनके पीछे कितनी इनकी हार्ड वर्क रही होगी वो सोचो अभी देखो एक और बेहतरीन वाली चीज दिखाने वाला हूं देखो ये वाला जो यहां पहुंचा हों ना इसके अंदर आपको और भी बहुत ही बेहतरीन चीज है जैसे कि कई और जो रॉकेट्स में स्पेस में जाने वाली चीजें हैं उनके किस तरीके के मॉडल्स रखे हैं वो देखो ये देखो यहां पे जो लगा हुआ है ना यह है ओरिजिनल सेटेलाइट जो मेरे सामने आप देख सकते हो रिमोट सेंसिंग ओरिजिनल सैटेलाइट है बिल्कुल एकदम छोटे से हमारे घर में जो काम में आने वाले स्पीकर का बक्शा होता है ना ठीक उतना सा है अभी देखा मैंने पहले कभी भी ऐसे ओरिजिनल सेटेलाइट नहीं देखा ये पहली बार देख रहा हूं कि कैसे सैटेलाइट जो अंतरिक्ष में जाता है वो कैसा होता होगा ये है और इसी का ठीक एक और यहां पे मॉडल रखा हुआ है ये भी बिल्कुल छोटा सा सैटेलाइट है इसके ऊपर लगी हुई ये आप सोलर प्लेट्स देख सकते हो और ये देखो ऐसा होता है ओरिजिनल सेटेलाइट इनके अंतरिक्ष में भेजे हुए इन्होंने इधर रखे हुए हैं और ये इधर एक पीछ है एक इन्होंने एग्जांपल भी दिखाया कि इनकी जो रॉकेट जाती है वो इस तरीके के साथ एक साथ ले जाती है इनको यह यहां पे एग्रीकल्चर के यूज में आने वाला एग्रीकल्चरल रोबोट है जिसमें हाई सेंसर लगे हैं और यह सेंसर क्या करता है यह ऑटोमेटिक डिटेक्ट करता है कि कौन सा वाला फल है वो पक चुका है जो फल पक चुका है उसको यह कैच करने के काम करता है और वहां से उठा कर के अपनी टोकरी के अंदर उन फलों को लगा लेता है यह एग्रीकल्चर यूज वाले रोबोट ये एक अनम व्हीकल है अब ये इसका चार्जिंग का कैसा सिस्टम है देखो ये अपने आप से आ करके अपने चार्जिंग स्टेशन पर खड़ा हो जाता है तो जैसा ऐसा होता है तो यह चार्जिंग स्टेशन जो है यह ऑटोमेटिक सेंसर से डिटेक्ट करता है कि उसका जो चार्जिंग पॉइंट है वो लेफ्ट राइट में कितना ऊपर नीचे जो भी है ये एडजस्ट करके उसमें ऑटोमेटिक प्लग हो जाता है मेरे पीछे का जो ये रोबोट है बहुत ही एंटीक विस है इसके बारे में जानते हैं और पता करते हैं एक्चुअली ये क्या चीज है और कैसे यह काम करता है हि नेम इमरो एंड वी इवेंटर हिम इनटू अ इंटरेक्ट वे यू कै चेक हैं ओ हि स्किन इ रि टच लाइक नस ए यूजुअली ही व दिस पले इ रिटेल स्पेस एंड इंटरेक्ट

इसी के साथ-साथ इन्होंने यह जो यहां पे पंडा रखा हुआ है इस पंडा को यूज किया था जेकी चैन के साथ और बहुत सारी मूवीज में इन्होंने इसको रिप्लेस किया है रियल पंडा से यह है डिलीवरी ड्रोन कहीं भी सामान

दिल के सिंबल आ जाएंगे जैसे नेहा मीटा हाय [संगीत] मीटा आई लाइक यू यह देखो इसकी आंखों में ना ये सिंबल आ गए दिल के तो इस तरीके से पूरा इसकी एक्शंस होते हैं तो कोई भी अगर बोरिंग फील करता है तो ये एंटरटेनमेंट के काम में आते हैं और काफी अच्छी चीजें हैं और इसको चार्ज अगर आपको करना है तो इसके यहां यहां पे नीचे की तरफ टाइप सी सॉकेट है जिसमें आप इसको चार्ज कर सकते हो काफी यूनिक इन लोगों ने इसको बनाया है रोबोटिक्स के अंदर ये मेरे सामने की तरफ आपको कुछ रोबोट्स के यहां पे मॉडल दिखाई पड़ रहे होंगे ये स्पेशली डिजाइन किए जाते हैं स्कूलों के अंदर बच्चों को कैसे एजुकेशन दी जाए और उनको दिमाग कैसे विकसित किया जाए और यहां पे मैं आपको दिखाता हूं कि कैसे ये सारी चीजें होती है इनका जो रोबोट्स का एजुकेशन है वो आगे कैसे बढ़ता है स्मार्ट एजुकेशन एक छोटी चीज नहीं है उसके लिए भी इन्होंने कितनी मेहनत की है वो देखो ये रोबोटिक मॉडल है अब इसको चलाया जा रहा है यहां से निकल कर के सीधा आगे कूदना है अब देखो यह पूरा बैलेंसिंग के साथ अभी जब छोटे बच्चे इन सब चीजों को वहीं से सीख के आते हैं तो ये जब बड़े होते हैं कॉलेज में जाते हैं यूनिवर्सिटी में जाते हैं तो उनके लिए टेक्नोलॉजी का डेवलपमेंट करना एक बड़ी चीज नहीं होती एक आसान चीज बन जाती है तो ये देखो कितना फास्ट स्पीड में चल सकता है धीरे चल सकता है अब ये जो सामने इसके ऑब्स्ट कल आया है ना इसके देखने की बात ये है कि इसकी जो साइज खुद की है और ये ऑब्स्ट कल साइज उसमें वर्क है तो इसको नीचे बिठा कर के आपको क्रॉस करना पड़ेगा इसी बीच में अब यह वाला रोबोट है

When it was launched
we did not receive it but now we have received it. As usual let's start from design if you see the
design you will know it is like S24 series. If you ask what is the
upgrade in the design previously for A series they
gave Corning Gorilla Glass 5 now for both they
have given Victus+ This is both for front and back. Even though both the phones look
the same, there is a difference in quality They have used metal
for the first time in A53. Quality is really solid. Even though there
is metallic look in A35 it is only plastic but
even then it is good. Nice. Let's see the weight now. Let's see the weight of A35 It is 210 grams. It is 214 grams. Only a small difference. Both the phones have
got the same display even the design is the same. If you look at A34 and A54 A34 has water drop only A54 had Infinity-O display. Here both have
Infinity-O display 6.6-inch Super
Amoled FHD+ display with 120Hz refresh rate. Eye care protection and
vision booster support is there plus both have got Corning
gorilla glass victus protection. Though both have different budgets,
display and spec are the same. Even brightness,
in-display finger print sensor Dolby atmos stereo system, everything
is the same. There is no change at all. Unlike last time based on the
price they have given punch hole and the same display is a plus. Samsung keep it up. Both the phones have got an important
feature which was present last time also. IP67 rating. If the phone drops in
the water unknowingly or you play with the phone in water they will say that
nothing will happen. But there are certain
conditions like depth, time whether it is good
water or salt water so do read the
terms and conditions. If you ask me this is a
very important feature. In this price segment only
certain brands give this feature. That they have retained it this
year also is something good. Usually we see the hardware
and talk about features but here we will see the features
first and then look into hardware. They have given certain
interesting features here. If you take photo
normally it will be good but when you take photo at night using AI you can make the bokeh
and flowers bigger and detailed It looks bright also. Tell us how this
photo looks like. Also when you take a photo it suggests
whether this is the best shot or not but to use this you will have
to switch on the feature inside. Even after taking a photo AI suggests
whether to remaster or to erase the object All this can be
done in one click. In the photo you have taken if
you want to know about an object you can put a round around
it and find out what it is. Yes the circle to search feature available
in S series is available in A series also. While taking a video if
there are several persons using auto framing feature you can set the frame
exactly and take the video. You can use these
in both the phones. But it is better
optimized in A55. Because of two reasons One the latest SoC has
been optimized with AI ISP. Second there is a small change in
the hardware of these two phones. First if you look into A55 50MP main camera
with OIS support you can shoot super
HDR video with it. It is not possible in
ultra wide and macro ultra wide is 12MP Macro is 5MP. In the front this small
punch hole is 32MP. Now if you see the change in A35 they would have removed the 12MP ultra
wide and given 8MP ultra wide instead. Selfie also they would have removed
32MP and given 13MP instead. So you will see a change
in ultra-wide and selfie but if you ask how you can see a change
in main camera as it has the same sensor that is the second reason. The camera's AI ISP is better
here since it has the latest SoC. Here since it has the
SoC of A54, it is only ok. Regarding video you can shoot in
4K 30fps in both, in the front also. Many people do not bother
about the switch feature, 4k 30fps but that they are
giving this is good. Even then they could have
given 4K 60fps in the back. The camera features in
both the phones are superb. A lot of features
have been provided. Photos and videos are good. ♪ Fast music plays ♪ Regarding SoC, last time they have
given dimensity in A34 and exynos in A54. But this time there
is no partiality. In A55 they have used Exynos
1480 which is a 4nm 5G SoC. Compared to last years 1380 it has an improvement
of 15% in CPU it has an improvement
of 32% in GPU and 167% improvement in NPU. That is nothing big. It is a small jump
in CPU and GPU. In hardware for the
first time in A55 series support till 12GB
RAM is provided. There is internal
support till 256GB. There are two
other variants also. It has got LPDDR5X
RAM with UFS 3.1. That was good. Regarding performance when
you use it normally it is good Regarding gaming compared to last time 70%
more vapor chamber cooling has been provided. Even when they
say gaming is good Simply it was good. But for this price we all know what
and all the other brands are giving. This is not enough. Benchmark comes to 7 lakhs only. The SoC in A35 is exynos 1380. The SoC which we saw in A54 they have given it here also. It is a good upgrade
from A34 to A35. A small change
in the hardware is for this price they have given
LPDDR 4X RAM with UFS 2.2. The benchmark and
AnTuTu is like this. We forgot to tell about OS. It is one UI 6.1 on out
of the box Android 14. They say that they will
give upto Android 18. Really no other
brand gives this. Others say 3 or 4 years They are giving four and five
years for all price segments. We don't know whether
SoC will last till that time. They have given knox security
and knox wallet along with it. The advantage of this is There will be secure
folder, private share maintenance mode
and quick share will there recently quick share
along with nearby share those who have nearby
share can also share. Along with this
security dashboard auto block where in
you can block threads This OS is good
for security reasons. Feature wise also you
can use Samsung wallet. NFC is also here you can add debit and
credit card, tap and pay. You can store your
government ID like this. You can show your boarding
pass in this and go inside. There is a feature called Samsung pass
wherein you can store your passwords. If you already have
a Samsung product the ecosystem seems to be
more seamless in A35 and A55. There are bloatwares inside. If you see you will know,
phonepay, Amazon are all there. Of course all these
can be uninstalled. But all these are
there in this price. Even though there is only five to six
gram difference between these phones Both have the same battery. 5000mAh battery with
25W fast charging support. However you use the
battery will last for one day. Because we have checked last time with
the same battery and fast charging support. It has been optimized more this
time so the battery will be good. Before telling our opinions
about both the phones you all know the price A35 costs Rs. 30,999 and A55 was
launched for Rs. 39,999. Now there is a offer wherein it costs Rs. 25,999 and Rs. 33,999. That is bank's cash
back. Do check it out. The actual rate is this. Instead of talking about the
worth of these phones for this price we can talk about for
whom this phone will suit. You also know why. For whom this will suit is I want to use Samsung pay Circle to search, low budget low budget means not very low you want to use it
within Rs. 30,000 already I am using a
Samsung phone for Rs. 20,000 and want to upgrade to
a phone worth Rs. 30,000 IP rating, 4 years OS updates Samsung's experience For all these you may like the phone."

the boundaries of what's possible tackling Humanity's most pressing challenges from AI revolutionizing scientific discovery to breakthroughs in organ transplantation these Innovations promise to reshape Our Lives let's explore the top 10 technologies that could Define our future uncovering their potential and the ethical dilemmas they present 10 genomics for transplants a pig's heart in a human chest in January 2024 David Bennett senior became the first human to receive a genetically modified pig heart this breakthrough in xenotransplantation offers hope to over 100,000 Americans on organ transplant waiting lists by genetically modifying Pig organs to be more compatible with human bodies scientists aim to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs however this technology faces ethical concerns from animal rights activists and risks of zoonotic diseases despite these challenges the potential to save countless lives is enormous but it raises profound questions about the boundaries between human and animal nine alternative livestock feeds from waste to nourishment with global population growth straining Food Systems scientists are turning to unexpected sources for livestock feed globally we produce over 1.3 billion tons of food waste annually repurposing this waste could address both food scarcity and waste management one approach uses black soldier fly larvey to break down food waste these protein Rich insects can be processed into animal feed in Trials chickens fed insect-based diets showed comparable growth rates to those on conventional feeds another Innovative source is single cell proteins from bacteria yeast or algae these microorganisms can be grown on Industrial byproducts turning we into valuable nutrients challenges include scaling up production ensuring consistent quality and navigating regulatory hurdles consumer acceptance of meat from animals fed these novel diets remains uncertain however these Alternatives offer a path towards more sustainable animal agriculture eight carbon capturing microbes engineered microbes are emerging as unlikely heroes in the battle against climate change scientists have modified certain bacteria and algae to consume CO2 more efficiently converting it into useful products like biofuels or biodegradable Plastics one such microb cacus elongatus has been engineered to produce ethanol from CO2 with efficiency surpassing many plants at scale these microbes could potentially sequester gigatons of CO2 annually significantly mitigating greenhouse gas emissions however ensuring the stability and safety of these engineered organisms in open environments is crucial concerns about about potential ecological disruptions and the energy requirements for maintaining optimal conditions at an industrial scale present significant hurdles seven elastocaloric the cool new way to heat and cool elastocaloric materials could revolutionize how we heat and cool our world when stretched or compressed these materials change temperature upon release they return to their original temperature absorbing heat in the process elastocaloric systems could be 20 to 30% more efficient than traditional Vapor compression systems used in most refrigerators and air conditioners given that cooling accounts for about 10% of global electricity consumption this Improvement is significant moreover these systems don't require harmful refrigerants like hydrofluorocarbons hfc's which are potent greenhouse gases however current elastocaloric materials often nickel titanium Alloys are expensive and can degrade over time scientists are exploring more abundant and eco friendly options like natural rubber but these are still in early stages of development six immersive technology for the built World immersive technology is blurring the line between digital and physical worlds changing how we design construct and interact with our surroundings cities like Helsinki are using digital twins to simulate and optimize everything from traffic flow to energy consumption allowing planners to test scenarios before implementing changes in construct ction augmented reality AR is revolutionizing building processes workers can use AR glasses to see 3D blueprints overlaid on physical space reducing Errors By up to 90% according to one study however this technology raises privacy concerns as our built environments become more connected and datadriven there's also the risk of deepening the digital divide as access to these Technologies may not be Equitable five integrated sensing and communication integrated sensing and communication ISAC technology could turn our wireless infrastructure into a vast sensing system ISAC uses radio waves not just to transmit data but also to gather information about the environment creating detailed maps of surroundings detecting movement and even monitoring air quality applications range from real-time traffic monitoring in smart cities to non-invasive patient monitoring in healthcare for autonom Vehicles it could offer an additional layer of environmental awareness early tests suggest ISAC could increase network capacity by up to 50% however it raises significant privacy concerns as a system that can detect movement through walls could easily be misused for surveillance four high altitude platform stations bringing the internet to new heights high altitude platform stations haps are essentially flying cell towers operating at altitudes of about 20 km they aim to provide internet connectivity to areas where traditional infrastructure is Impractical or impossible as of 2023 over 2.6 billion people in 100 countries still lack internet access haps could change that bringing educational resources tele medicine and economic opportunities to previously unconnected communities haps can be deployed quickly in response to natural disasters restoring communication when it's needed most there ALS o more cost effective than building traditional cell towers in sparsely populated areas however keeping these platforms aoft for extended periods requires Advanced Materials and energy systems navigating complex International airspace regulations and addressing potential environmental impacts are ongoing challenges three reconfigurable intelligent surfaces reconfigurable intelligent surfaces RIS are smart panels that can dynamically alter their electromagnetic properties redirecting signals to areas with poor coverage enhancing signal strength or creating interference free zones early studies suggest RIS could increase network capacity by up to 10 times while significantly reducing energy consumption in dense Urban environments RIS could dramatically improve connectivity without additional base stations Beyond improving phone signals RIS could enable precise indoor positioning accurate to within a centimeter Revolution solutionizing industries from Healthcare to manufacturing however creating surfaces that can effectively manipulate signals across a wide range of frequencies is technically complex and potentially expensive privacy concerns have also been raised as the ability to precisely control wireless signals could potentially be used for targeted surveillance two privacy enhancing Technologies privacy enhancing Technologies pets are designed to protect personal information in our datadriven World they include Advanced encryption methods and synthetic data generation homomorphic encryption allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first potentially revolutionizing Fields like healthcare by enabling analysis of sensitive medical data without compromising patient privacy Federated learning allows AI models to be trained on distributed data sets without centralizing data already used by companies like Google to improve keyboard predictions without accessing users personal messages pets could enable new forms of collaboration and data sharing unlocking previously inaccessible insights due to privacy concerns however many of these Technologies are computationally intensive potentially slowing down systems or increasing costs one AI for scientific discovery unleashing the power of machine Minds AI is fundamentally changing how we explore and understand our world in drug Discovery the first AI design drug entered human clinical trials in 2023 developed in just 12 months at a fraction of the usual cost this could open up possibilities for treating rare diseases previously considered economically unfeasible in Material Science AI is predicting properties of new compounds before they're synthesized one AI system recently identified a new material for more efficient solar cells potentially accelerating our transition to renewable energy even in theoretical physics AI is making breakthrough in 2023 an AI model solved a decades old problem in nuclear fusion identifying optimal magnetic field configurations overlooked by human scientists AI can identify patterns in vast data sets impossible for human researchers to spot leading to new hypotheses across fields from astronomy to Neuroscience however concerns about the blackbox nature of some AI systems rais questions about reproducibility and scientific understanding there's also a risk of AI perpetuating biases present in training data potentially skewing research ensuring Equitable access to these Technologies is crucial to prevent a scientific divide between those with and without access to Advanced AI systems as we venture into this Aid driven scientific Frontier we must balance the immense potential with careful consideration of its implications these top 10 Technologies of 2024 promise to reshape our world but they're true
